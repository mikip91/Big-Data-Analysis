Many high achievers  particularly women and people of color  suffer from impostor syndrome  the fear that they don t belong in the rarefied realm to which they ve ascended and that they will soon be found out  Even Michelle Obama  who is  according to a Gallup poll conducted last year  the most admired woman in America  has said that she feels it   I share that with you because we all have doubts in our abilities  about our power and what that power is   she told students in London in December Well  maybe not all of us  I ve just finished Vicky Ward s  Kushner  Inc    a scintillating investigation of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump s White House sojourn  which comes out on Tuesday  It s full of damning details  contempt for the entitled  venal couple may be the one thing that unites all of D C  s warring factions  Still  the first daughter and her husband remain psychologically mysterious  at least to me  Why don t they have impostor syndrome  given that their total lack of qualifications for the jobs they are doing makes them actual impostors According to  Kushner  Inc    Gary Cohn  former director of the National Economic Council  has told people that Ivanka Trump thinks she could someday be president   Her father s reign in Washington  D C   is  she believes  the beginning of a great American dynasty   writes Ward  Kushner  whose pre White House experience included owning a boutique newspaper and helming a catastrophically ill timed real estate deal  has arrogated to himself substantial parts of American foreign policy  According to Ward  shortly after Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of state  Kushner told him  to leave Mexico to him because he d have Nafta wrapped up by October   As political actors  the couple are living exemplars of the Dunning Kruger effect  a psychological phenomenon which leads incompetent people to overestimate their ability because they can t grasp how much they don t know  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Partly  the Jared and Ivanka story is about the  reality distortion field    a term one of Ward s sources uses about Kushner   created by great family wealth  She quotes a member of Trump s legal team saying that the two  have no idea how normal people perceive  understand  intuit   Privilege  in them  has been raised to the level of near sociopathy Ward  the author of two previous books about the worlds of high finance and real estate  has known Kushner slightly for a long time  she told me that when he bought The New York Observer newspaper in 2006  he tried to hire her  She knocks down the idea that either he or his wife is a stabilizing force or moral compass in the Trump administration  Multiple White House sources told her they think it was Kushner who ordered the closing of White House visitor logs in April 2017  because he  didn t want his frenetic networking exposed   Ward reports that Cohn was stunned by their blasé reaction to Trump s defense of the white nationalist marchers in Charlottesville  Va    He was upset that they were not sufficiently upset  Still  even if you assume that the couple are amoral climbers  their behavior still doesn t quite make sense  Ward writes that Ivanka s chief concern is her personal brand  but that brand has been trashed  The book cites an October 2017 survey measuring consumer approval of more than 1 600 brands  Ivanka s fashion line was in the bottom 10  A leading real estate developer tells Ward that Kushner  now caught up in multiple state and federal investigations  has become radioactive   No one will want to do business with him    Kushner resigned as C E O  of Kushner Companies in 2017  but has kept most of his stake in the business  To truly make sense of their motivations  Ward told me  you have to understand the gravitational pull of their fathers  Husband and wife are both  really extraordinarily orientated and identified through their respective fathers in a way that most fully formed adults are not   she said Among the most interesting parts of  Kushner  Inc    are the chapters about the business history of Charles Kushner  Jared s felonious father  and his plan to restore his reputation  with Jared s help  after getting out of prison in 2006  Part of that rehabilitation project was the purchase of a flagship building in Manhattan   666 Fifth Avenue  an absurdly on the nose address   for which the family paid a record amount at the very height of the real estate market in 2007  When the Great Recession hit  the building became a white elephant  its debt threatening the family fortune Ward s book suggests that the search for someone who would bail out 666 Fifth Avenue has played a significant role in American foreign policy during the Trump administration  And since the completion of her book  we ve learned that Trump overrode intelligence officials  who were concerned about Kushner and his family

KUWAIT CITY   The United States  attempts to isolate Iran  including by punishing Iraqi militias and politicians who are supported by Iranian officials  has deepened tensions not only between Washington and Baghdad but also within the Trump administration American military and intelligence officials said the increasing pressure on Iraq risks infuriating its Parliament  including politicians linked to Iran  which could limit the movements of the 5 200 United States troops based in Iraq Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  whose confrontational stand on Iran has already strained ties with European allies  is leading the push for Iraq to confront its fellow Shiite majority neighbor  He arrived in the Middle East on Tuesday to speak with officials in Kuwait  Israel and Lebanon about containing Iran Under plans recommended by Mr  Pompeo and some White House officials  the State Department would designate Iran s military Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization  It would be a first instance of the United States designating a unit of another government s military as a terrorist group  American officials said it could put United States troops and intelligence officers at risk of similar actions by foreign governments The plans also would designate some Iraqi Shiite militias as foreign terrorist organizations  As a result  the Iranian trained militias   and Iraqi officials who support them   would be subject to new economic sanctions and travel restrictions The proposal was described to The New York Times on condition of anonymity by a half dozen American and Iraqi officials and experts familiar with the sensitive diplomatic plans but not authorized to discuss them by name Mr  Pompeo confirmed Monday night that he was looking at various groups  including the Revolutionary Guards in Iran  after he was asked by The Times on the flight to Kuwait about the proposed designations  There may well be other organizations that we designate   he said  The State Department designated an Iraqi group as a terrorist organization this month  despite opposition from the Pentagon The Iraqi militias   some of which were trained by the Revolutionary Guards   operate with Baghdad s approval or financial support  Several are legitimate players in Iraqi politics  They are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces  an umbrella organization of about 50 paramilitary groups that fought against the Islamic State  a radical Sunni group  and are paid by the Shiite dominated Iraqi government  The Americans can make the decisions they want  but what the Americans see is different than what we see   Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said last week   Our position on the Popular Mobilization Forces is very clear and well known  Officials at the Pentagon and the C I A    which Mr  Pompeo ran in the Trump administration s first year   oppose designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guards or the Iraqi militias as terrorist groups  fearing a backlash that could constrain American troops  Qassim Suleimani  commander of the corps  elite Quds Force and a regular visitor to Iraq  has been designated a terrorist by the United States ImageMike Pompeo  the secretary of state  has told Iraqi leaders they must stop buying Iranian natural gas  a major energy source for power starved Iraq CreditWin Mcnamee Getty ImagesIraqi leaders were already irate over the Trump administration s insistence that they comply with American sanctions imposed against Iran after President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Tehran Tensions between Washington and Baghdad have only risen through the winter In February  Iraqi politicians bristled after Mr  Trump said American troops in Iraq would monitor and pressure Iran  Iraqi leaders are resisting demands by Mr  Pompeo to stop buying energy from Iran   another issue on which Pentagon officials have sided with Baghdad  Iraq officials also remain unhappy by the closing of the United States Consulate in Basra  the country s second largest city  where a temporary halt of electricity exports from Iran led to violent rioting last summer On Friday  a senior State Department official said Mr  Pompeo s visit to the Middle East this week was part of the goal of rolling back Iran s forces and linked Shiite militias  As with Iraq  the pressure campaign has angered leaders in Lebanon  where Iran backed Hezbollah is a major military force  holds parliamentary seats and runs the health ministry Analysts said Mr  Pompeo s trip and its focus on Iran is an attempt to lend Trump administration support to embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel before national elections set for April 9  Iran and Israel are longtime enemies  Mr  Pompeo has denied such intentions Mr  Pompeo has told the leaders of power starved Iraq that they must stop buying Iranian natural gas and electricity  But on Tuesday  following recommendations by senior Pentagon officials  he agreed to extend a waiver of the sanctions to allow Iraq to buy electricity from Iran  The new waiver will expire in 90 days  in the middle of Iraq s scorching summer If they are forced to stop buying electricity from Iran  Iraqi officials warned  protests could destabilize the government of Mr  Abdul Mahdi  who was named prime minister in October  In February  he said Iraq would not comply with the sanctions  citing the 13 years of United Nations sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein that took a bruising toll on Iraqis throughout the country Iraqi officials now are exploring how to buy natural gas from Iran but still protect Iraqi banks from American penalties This month  against the advice of officials at the Pentagon  the State Department announced that it was designating an Iraqi militia  Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba  and its leader  Akram Abbas al Kaabi  as  specially designated global terrorists   The group is funded by the Iraqi government  but the State Department said its loyalty was to Iran Mr  Pompeo also is seeking to designate a more significant group  Asa ib Ahl al Haq  as a terrorist organization  Asa ib Ahl al Haq won 15 seats in Iraq s Parliament last year  Though its officials now say they tolerate the United States military presence in Iraq  the militia fought American troops at the height of the Iraq war  The militia is led by Qais al Khazali  a former American detainee who is accused of masterminding an ambush in the holy Shiite city of Karbala that killed five American soldiers in 2007 After Mr  Trump announced in December that he would withdraw United States forces from the fight against the Islamic State in Syria  American officials began quietly negotiating with Iraqi counterparts to shift hundreds of commandos and support troops to Iraq  The initial urgency for the shift has cooled  however  now that Mr  Trump has agreed to leave 400 American troops in Syria rather than withdraw all 2 000  But many Iraqi lawmakers are reluctant to give the 5 200 American troops already in Baghdad and at a handful of other bases much freedom to move or operate The terrorist designations could complicate talks over those issues and a range of diplomatic matters by fueling animosity toward the United States  One senior American official said the designations could lead to barring members of the Iraqi and Iranian governments from traveling to the United States   including to the United Nations in New York Administration lawyers have been poring over the proposed language for the terrorist designations and their possible consequences  So far  that has kept Mr  Pompeo from issuing them  two senior American officials said  One official said that trying to enforce the sanctions that the terrorist designations would prompt would be a nightmare

In recent decades  the sleek  wide eyed vaquita porpoise has been pushed to the brink of extinction by poachers pursuing another critically endangered sea creature  the totoaba  a fish whose swim bladder sells on the Chinese black market for thousands of dollars  The porpoises end up caught in nets intended for the totoaba and killed as collateral damage  The vaquita  its name is Spanish for  little cow   is a toothed whale and the smallest of all cetaceans  a full grown female can measure just five feet and weigh only 75 pounds  Thousands of vaquitas once plowed the Sea of Cortez  also known as the Gulf of California  which is bordered on the east by the Mexican mainland and on the west by the Baja California peninsula  Today  their numbers are estimated at around 10 but no more than 22 in the wild  Without a strictly enforced ban on even possessing gillnets  the species will soon go extinct in the wild  Just last week  the badly decomposed body of what was thought to be a vaquita was found caught in a gillnet There is little time left to act to save the vaquita  yet there is hope  For Mexico s new president  Andrés Manuel López Obrador  the fate of the little porpoise represents political opportunity and the chance of failure  He can do nothing and preside over the first sea mammal extinction in North America in decades  Or he can save one of Mexico s national symbols and rescue a troubled fishing industry   This is doable even now   said Brooke Bessesen  a conservationist and author of a new book   Vaquita  Science Politics and Crime in the Sea of Cortez    We have to come up with solutions that buy time  This is not a numbers game  It s a game of time  The Sea of Cortez is 62 000 square miles of azure and turquoise water that ranks as one of the most productive fisheries in the world  with more than 900 species of fin fish  including blue marlin and whale sharks  Commercial fishing started in earnest in the 1940s and is largely concentrated off the Mexican state of Sonora  on the eastern shore of the sea  But poachers are generally thought to be the problem these days The small scale fishermen who live on the sea s western and northern shores motor out in cheap fiberglass skiffs known as pangas  armed with gillnets  These nets  made from near invisible nylon mono  and multifilament  float on or near the surface and are weighted at the bottom  They kill indiscriminately  entangling everything from sea lion pups to great white sharks  Today  there are so many abandoned nets that the government pays fishermen to drag them ashore Poor poachers still use gillnets to catch the totoaba  whose swim bladder sells for  20 000 on average in China for traditional medicine and even as investments  A bladder is both a high end business gift and a sort of trophy in itself  The trade is so lucrative that the drug cartels have become involved in the poaching  Last April  Mexican authorities stopped a Chinese man at the Mexico City International Airport with 355 totoaba swim bladders  Three days later  another Chinese man bound for China had 417 swim bladders in two suitcases  And in December  Chinese officials confiscated 980 pounds of swim bladders  estimated to be worth  26 million  Sixteen people were arrested So it is no wonder that poachers and their gillnets have pushed the totoaba onto the list of critically endangered species maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature  and dragged the even more endangered vaquita along with it  The tiny porpoises drown when they are snagged in these nets The Mexican government shares some of the blame  Warnings that the vaquita might vanish arose years ago when there were still hundreds in the wild  but it failed to take effective actions to protect them  Mr  López Obrador s predecessor  Enrique Peña Nieto  banned the use of gill nets in the porpoise s habitat in 2015  for instance  but not their possession An attempt to capture porpoises to breed them in captivity in 2017 led to one dying  another nearly did and had to be released  The  totoaba  however  is being bred in captivity  giving the species a path to survival  But that effort is likely to be counterproductive for the vaquita  because it will only encourage more poaching of the totoaba The vaquita s situation is so dire that Thomas A  Jefferson  a San Diego marine biologist and conservationist  said he feared that extinction was its most likely fate   The conservationist in me doesn t want to admit that but the biologist has to   he said Yet the vaquita clings to life  In October  four were spotted in open water  The little porpoise may possess a unique genetic advantage that could allow it to recover in the wild if just left alone  The vaquita was never widely distributed  numbering perhaps only 5 000 at its modern height and located only in the Sea of Cortez  But there is no evidence that it has hit the bottleneck of birth defects from inbreeding often seen in declining populations And so  there is hope   if President López Obrador acts swiftly  The vaquita is one of Mexico s national animals  along with the golden eagle and the jaguar  He s under economic pressure to do so  But by acting aggressively to save the porpoise  he can also fulfill core campaign promises and emerge a hero  not just in Mexico but around the world   Pressure is coming from the United States  Last year  the United States Court of International Trade in New York temporarily banned seafood imports from Mexico caught in the Sea of Cortez with gillnets  The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by environmentalists complaining that the Trump administration was not enforcing a 1972 law that protects marine mammals from being killed in the process of fishing  It has been a crippling blow to the fishing industry in the Sea of Cortez  blocking an estimated 1 400 tons of seafood worth  300 million from being sold in the United States  Even before that  the grocery retailer Trader Joe s had banned blue shrimp from the Sea of Cortez from its nearly 500 stores because of concerns that vaquitas were being killed in gillnets intended for shrimp Even if he wasn t facing that economic pressure  saving the vaquita represents an opportunity for the new president  Mexican presidents cannot run for re election  so Mr  López Obrador is at the zenith of his power at the start of his six year term  By banning the possession of gillnets  Mr  López Obrador would slow the killing of both the totoaba and the vaquita and perhaps resolve the trade dispute with the United States  By expanding the practice of paying more fisherman to remove ghost nets  he would put idle anglers to work  By allowing video of illegal fishing to be used as evidence in court   it is now not admissible   the Mexican Navy could make poaching arrests stick  And by managing the fishery wisely  he would keep it producing for Mexicans and foreign markets alike  Already this kind of fishery management is taking shape in parts of Sonora  There has to be some way  But this comes down to López Obrador   said Ms  Bessesen  the author   He is the remaining flicker of hope for the vaquita  So  yes  there is hope  But in the Sea of Cortez  there is little time for either the president or the porpoise  Richard Parker is the author of  Lone Star Nation  How

ERBIL  Iraq   American backed forces in northern Syria have captured a group suspected of organizing a bomb attack that killed four Americans and a number of allied Syrian militia fighters in January  a spokesman for the local forces said on Tuesday The spokesman  Mustafa Bali  wrote on Twitter that his group  the Syrian Democratic Forces  had used  technical surveillance  to find and arrest the suspects The bombing  on Jan  16  was the deadliest attack on Americans in Syria since Washington began a military campaign against the jihadists of the Islamic State in 2014  and it occurred in an area the United States had considered safe  Identifying those involved could help explain how the jihadists were able to strike far from their last stronghold The arrests were first reported by Reuters  A United States military official confirmed that Syrian allies had captured a small number of people linked to the attack in recent days but provided no further detail Col  Sean Ryan  a spokesman for the American led military coalition against the Islamic State  declined to comment further  citing in an email a continuing investigation In the attack  a suicide bomber entered a popular restaurant in the Syrian town of Manbij where American military personnel had stopped during a patrol to eat with their local Syrian allies The Americans killed were a military linguist who worked with the National Security Agency  a member of the Army Special Forces  a former Navy SEAL who did intelligence work for a Pentagon agency and an Arabic interpreter who worked for a private defense contractor At least 11 Syrians were also killed  most of them members of the Syrian Democratic Forces  a Kurdish led militia that has been working with the United States to fight the Islamic State Mr  Bali did not say how many suspects there were  or when or how they had been arrested The arrests come at a critical juncture for the future of the United States presence in eastern Syria President Trump has said that he wants to withdraw the roughly 2 000 American troops posted there  although that plan has been repeatedly revised  leaving American allies and even many United States officials confused about what Washington s policy is  Recently  the Trump administration has said that it is planning to leave 400 troops in Syria to continue working with American allies and to stop Iran and its allies from making inroads in the area It remains to be seen whether the American withdrawal will accelerate after the defeat of the Islamic State s last patch of territory  On Tuesday  officials from the Syrian Democratic Forces said the jihadists  territory had been reduced to a small patch of land along the Euphrates River near the village of Baghuz But the battle there has lasted much longer than predicted  and tens of thousands of fighters and civilians have surrendered as the jihadists  territory has dwindled  Most of the men are in prison and most of the women and children are in overcrowded refugee camps

that it was canceling plans to build a major campus in Queens  the company did not directly blame any one person or group But others have Governor Cuomo  who with Mayor de Blasio helped negotiate the deal largely in private  blamed the State Senate  where crucial leaders opposed the plan Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  who opposed the campus  blamed Amazon for seeking  3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that she said should have been spent elsewhere Now a poll is offering insight into how the public feels about the deal s collapse  Over a third of New Yorkers point the finger at Ms  Ocasio Cortez  according to a Siena College Research Institute survey of 700 voters Here s what else you need to know about the poll  which was released yesterday The deal was popular across the state  Two thirds of voters said Amazon s withdrawal was bad for New York Sixty three percent of Democrats and 56 percent of self identified liberals said the cancellation was bad for New York Sixty four percent of New York City voters agreed with them Blame fell on Ms  Ocasio Cortez  Thirty eight percent of voters faulted the congresswoman for the deal s demise  identifying her as a  villain

fewer than 30 percent of voters What about Amazon  The company was blamed by 26 percent of voters The takeaways   The progressive base that cheered Ms  Ocasio Cortez as she railed against the deal was not representative of most voters  Those closest to a project don t necessarily reflect the views of a wider audience   said Steven Greenberg  a pollster with Siena College   I asked Mr  Greenberg if by  closest  he meant physical proximity  and he replied   Yes      Local activists in Queens  were blamed more often for the plan s demise than the State Senate was  In the suburbs  39 percent of voters labeled the activists as villains  but only 23 percent labeled the Senate as such This matters in part because Democrats need to retain suburban seats to hold on to their Senate majority The

are still debating and that others have never heard of And it s  a New York story   Richard H  Weisberg  a professor at Cardozo School of Law  said The couple were tried in the Southern District of New York and buried on Long Island  New Yorkers  had connections to the case   parents  uncles  aunts  grandparents   Professor Weisberg said  It s a story of how a couple that owns a ma and pa electronic fix it store becomes swept up in the web of an investigation   Professor Weisberg said   And there are so many unresolved issues  even the guilt and innocence of both Julius and Ethel   who should be seen separately  really in a way   is unclear at the moment  The case is more than 60 years old  but some at Cardozo say it shouldn t be forgotten  Today at 4 p m   the law school will

need to look at it square in the face to learn its lessons  Barbara Kolson  the co director of the Fashion  Arts  Media and Entertainment Center at Cardozo  who helped organize the event  said the

After more than a week of near silence  Dennis A  Muilenburg  the chief executive of Boeing  made his first substantive public comments about the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 In a statement released by Boeing on Monday night  Mr  Muilenburg expressed remorse for the deaths of 346 people in two strikingly similar air disasters involving the company s 737 Max jets   the accident in Ethiopia  on March 10  and the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia in October  Our hearts are heavy  and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board   Mr  Muilenburg said The investigations into the causes of both crashes are still in progress  and no conclusions have been reached by the authorities  But preliminary data suggests that a combination of new software  faulty sensor readings and inadequate pilot training may have been to blame French air accident investigators confirmed on Monday that flight recorder data from the Ethiopian Airlines jet showed  clear similarities  with the Lion Air jet The B E A   the French agency that investigates aviation crashes and incidents  said in a statement that the investigation team had noted these similarities  during the verification process  of data from the flight recorder  which keeps information like altitude and speed Mr  Muilenburg said Boeing was  taking actions to fully ensure the safety of the 737 Max   based on the information the company got from the investigations Among those actions is a software update that has been in the works for months  in response to the Lion Air crash  He said the update was due  soon  Mr  Muilenburg had been conspicuously quiet since the latest crash  as regulators around the world grounded Boeing jets and the company s stock slumped 12 percent He did make time to call President Trump twice   first on Tuesday of last week to press the president to keep the 737 Max jets flying  and a day later to encourage their grounding But on Monday night  Mr  Muilenburg for the first time appeared to try to reassure the public   Safety is at the core of who we are at Boeing  and ensuring safe and reliable travel on our airplanes is an enduring value and our absolute commitment to everyone   he said   This overarching focus on safety spans and binds together our entire global aerospace industry and communities  After the crash in Indonesia  Boeing faced tough questions about the development of the 737 Max  and a flight control system known as MCAS in particular  which will get the promised software upgrade  Other questions are being raised about the company s training procedures  When the plane was introduced  Boeing believed that pilots who had flown an earlier model didn t need additional simulator training and regulators agreed Many experts believe MCAS played a role in that first crash  But the Max jets continued to fly  reflecting the confidence of Boeing  regulators and pilots that the planes were beyond reproach But Boeing was thrust into a crisis last week when another jet crashed in nearly identical circumstances  Boeing s newest jet  its best seller  is now grounded  airlines are demanding compensation  and there is no clear timetable for the return of the Max planes And in a development that could have far reaching implications  Canada s aviation regulator is reviewing its validation of the American certification of the 737 Max  Marc Garneau  the transport minister  told reporters on Monday  We may not change anything  but we think it s a good idea to review that at this time   Mr  Garneau said

Michael Barbaro  produced by Theo Balcomb and Clare Toeniskoetter  and edited by Paige CowettThe aerospace giant and its ties to Washington are under scrutiny after a version of its best selling plane was involved in two deadly accidents in five months michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  As Boeing developed a new line of passenger jets  it was determined to avoid costly training for pilots  Then  two of those jets crashed  It s Tuesday  March 19 natalie kitroeffThe global aerospace business is essentially a duopoly  There are two big companies  There s Boeing  which is American owned  and there s Airbus  a European rival michael barbaroNatalie Kitroeff is a business reporter at The Times natalie kitroeffThese two are always competing with each other  They are competing on every single aspect of an airplane  And they re often competing for the same customers  music natalie kitroeffSo in late 2010  archived recordingWe re not redesigning the A320  It s pretty damn good just the way it is  What we re doing is offering new  more fuel efficient engines on today s airplane natalie kitroeff  Airbus announces that it is offering a new  fuel efficient version of its best selling A320 plane archived recordingWell  an A320neo  natalie kitroeffIt s going to be the A320neo archived recordingIt s a new engine option offered on today s A320 family of aircraft  And now they re being offered with new  more fuel efficient engines  We re putting our money on re engining the world s best selling single aisle aircraft natalie kitroeffThis amounts to essentially a frontal assault for Boeing  Fuel savings mean that airlines are saving on costs  And if Airbus is going to offer an option that is going to save airlines money  Boeing better will come up with its own alternative in order to compete in this cutthroat environment  where they have one main rival michael barbaroSo what does Boeing do in response to its biggest and most important rival coming up with this fuel efficient jetliner natalie kitroeffBoeing scrambles to respond quickly archived recording MUSIC  We are making a decision to invest in the 737 family natalie kitroeffAnd within months  the company comes up with an upgrade of its own archived recordingMax efficiency  which leads to profitability  max reliability  and to the flying public  max passenger appeal natalie kitroeffIt s going to be a fuel efficient version of their 737 workhorse  It is going to have bigger engines  And it s going to save airlines money on this fuel archived recordingThe best single aisle airplane in the world   MUSIC natalie kitroeffAnd they re going to call it the 737 Max  And one of the main goals of this engineering process is to keep this new plane as similar to its predecessor as possible michael barbaroWhy natalie kitroeffPart of the reason is that Boeing is competing with Airbus  And they re competing with them on every single cost item  And a plane is not just metal and technology  It s also what it costs to operate the aircraft and to train pilots to fly it michael barbaroHm natalie kitroeffIf the 737 Max turned out to be so different from its predecessor that it required training on a flight simulator  one of these giant machines where you have a cockpit and it mimics the experience of flying the plane  it would cost airlines tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft  It s incredibly expensive  So if Boeing were to say  we have this beautiful new jet  but it s going to require twice the amount of training that the Airbus model requires  the executives might pause on that  So as the company is manufacturing this plane  it wants to find ways to make it fly exactly the way that its predecessors did michael barbaroSo that there is not a need for training natalie kitroeffExactly  And there s a little bit of a problem  music natalie kitroeffThere is something that is fundamentally different about this plane  Its engines are bigger  and those engines need to be mounted farther forward on the wings  And that changes the aerodynamics of the plane  So the placement of those engines makes the nose of the plane push upward in certain circumstances  And that can lead to a stall  which is a dangerous situation  So Boeing has to come up with a solution to make the plane act the way its predecessor did and to counteract that force  So what it does is it comes up with this system  this software michael barbaroAnd what does the new system do natalie kitroeffThe new system automatically corrects for that upward motion of the nose  And it pushes the nose down automatically  And it s supposed to be working in the background  in a way that pilots don t even notice  correcting for an issue that was not in the prior model of this plane  And it s supposed to be something that is just keeping the pilot in a position where he or she feels as though the plane is flying in the same exact way under the same conditions that the prior model did michael barbaroSo Boeing thinks even though the engines are different  that they have developed a system that makes the engines operate essentially the same way the old 737 did  And from a pilot s point of view  therefore  there would be no need for new training natalie kitroeffYes  Boeing believed there was no need for extra training for pilots who had flown the previous model  And the Federal Aviation Administration agreed  In March 2017  the F A A  certified the plane  It did not require flight simulator training for pilots who had flown the prior model  And regulators around the world followed suit  Two months later  Boeing shipped out its first 737 Max out of Seattle  And the company decided that it does not need to fully inform pilots that this new software even exists michael barbaroHmm  So they don t even tell the pilots  They think it is so unimportant to the operation of the plane from the experience of a pilot that they don t even need to know natalie kitroeffYes  music michael barbaroSo what happens next  This plane is certified  on the market  What happens archived recordingWell  it s wheels up for Boeing s new 737 Max natalie kitroeffOrders come pouring in from across the globe archived recordingBoeing says the Max 8 is the company s fastest selling plane in its history  with nearly 4 700 orders for more than 100 customers across the world natalie kitroeffAnd carriers make this the best selling Boeing jet ever archived recording100 737 Maxes expected to be sold to AerCap  That s a lessor from the Netherlands  Also  Korean Airlines expected to order 30 of those natalie kitroeffPilots love it archived recordingIt flew beautifully  Its engines were extremely quiet natalie kitroeffIt is a hit archived recording 1Still  take a look at shares of Boeing  which  archived recording 2Are up  And up today natalie kitroeffThey re enjoying a ton of success in the stock market archived recording 14Logged orders or commitments for almost 400 aircraft  with a total sticker price of more than  37 billion natalie kitroeffInvestors love them  customers love them   until October 29  2018  when Lion Air Flight 610  a 737 Max carrying 189 people  takes off and  12 minutes later  crashes into the Java Sea archived recordingThree days after Lion Air Flight JT610 mysteriously disappeared before plummeting into the sea  there may be hope for answers michael barbaroWhat do we learn about what went wrong on that flight archived recordingMilitary personnel have found one of the black boxes natalie kitroeffSo a picture begins to emerge of this flight that suggests that the pilot may be fighting with that system archived recordingFlight data shows the on board computers were pushing the plane s nose down  Then the pilots aimed the nose higher  That happened 26 times  with the crew never following procedures to correct the problem natalie kitroeffSo while the software is pushing the nose down  the pilot is trying to push it back up over and over and over again  multiple times  That is the picture that begins to emerge  But we do not have full conclusive evidence yet michael barbaroSo it seems like the pilots on this flight are fighting a flight control system  a self correcting one that s supposed to keep the nose from going up  that they don t even know exists  right natalie kitroeffThat s exactly right  And what experts believe was happening was that this system was taking in a faulty sensor reading  So it was responding to bad data  And that is why it kept triggering over and over and over again  despite the pilot s best efforts to get the plane back on course michael barbaroAnd eventually those pilots lose their battle against the system natalie kitroeffEventually  the plane plunges into the sea  killing all 189 people on board  music michael barbaroWhat  Natalie  is the reaction among the airlines that have bought this line of planes to this emerging realization that Boeing hadn t revealed what turned out to be this important piece of information  the existence of this system that may likely have contributed to this crash natalie kitroeffPilots are furious   livid  in fact   that they have not been informed that this thing even exists  So they have these meetings  in which they told Boeing officials that this was a breach of trust and that it was disrespectful michael barbaroSo I have to assume that these angry pilots  in addition to just wanting to be sure everyone knows about this system  are demanding training so that they can properly respond to this system natalie kitroeffNo  they re not  The F A A   Boeing  nobody is recommending more training on this system michael barbaroWhy not natalie kitroeffThe American pilots that I ve talked to  they believe that because they ve been informed about the system  now that they know how it works  they are able to safely fly this plane  They know how to deal with this software if it becomes an issue on their flights  And they feel confident about flying the plane  This is a confidence that s  in part  based on statistics and experience  There has been only one fatality on U S  airlines in the last decade  Boeing has an enviable safety record  In many ways  they had good reason to be confident  And they re also promised a fix to the software that pushes the nose down  That s going to come within the next several weeks  They will be informed of it  And they feel confident that that is enough michael barbaroO K   so after this Lion Air crash  the only thing that changes is that Boeing vows to fix the system  But no additional training is ordered for any pilot anywhere  And the 737 Max planes are free to keep flying natalie kitroeffYes archived recording 1A jet has crashed  and the tragedy is being felt around the world archived recording 2U S  aviation investigators and a technical team from Boeing are headed to Ethiopia tonight  That s where a new 737 Max 8 jetliner crashed today  minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa archived recording 3Killing everyone on board  Flight 302 was en route to Nairobi  Kenya  when it crashed in the town of Bishoftu just six minutes after takeoff  The plane was carrying 149 passengers and 8 crew members natalie kitroeffImmediately  it becomes apparent that there are some similarities between this flight and the Lion Air crash archived recording 1Preliminary data shows a  quote   clear similarity  to the Lion Air Max 8 crash off Indonesia in October archived recording 2Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts archived recording 3What we now understand is what people had suspected  that there are certain similarities between the Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian crash earlier this month michael barbaroWhat are those similarities natalie kitroeffSo the pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported flight control problems  So that was a first clue  The plane is also moving in the same way that the Lion Air plane was  up and down  The speeds are changing rapidly  suggesting that the pilot may have been fighting with this system  again  with the pilot trying to pull the nose up  and the system pushing it down  Then there is physical evidence recovered at the site of the crash that seems to suggest that the nose was being pitched down  We don t know why  But again  it all points to this system being involved  potentially contributing to another tragedy michael barbaroAnd so what is the reaction this time  after the second crash of a 737 Max natalie kitroeffBoeing stands firm behind the plane  And American carriers are right there with them  But  archived recordingChina has grounded its entire Boeing 737 Max fleet natalie kitroeff  regulators around the world seem a little less confident  The Chinese and Indonesians quickly ground the 737 Max archived recordingMore countries following China s lead and grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet natalie kitroeffOnce the Europeans follow  archived recordingEuropean Aviation Safety Agency  they have banned flights of the 737 Max series  adding to similar groundings by China  Indonesia  Australia  Malaysia  the U K   Singapore  New Zealand  France  Germany  Italy  Ireland  Netherlands  Turkey  I could go on natalie kitroeff  American regulators are all of a sudden under immense pressure for the F A A  to ground these planes archived recording  donald trump Boeing is an incredible company  They are working very  very hard right now  And hopefully  they ll very quickly come up with the answer  But until they do  the planes are grounded michael barbaroAll of this looks very bad for Boeing  obviously  And it seems to stem from this original motivation  as you described it  to avoid classifying this new energy efficient plane that would compete against Airbuses as fundamentally different from older models of the 737 that would require expensive training of the pilots  even though a very crucial part of the plane was different natalie kitroeffThat s right  This motivation to keep this plane as similar as possible to its predecessor permeated the entire engineering process  Remember  this is how Boeing needs to compete with Airbus  It s also raising questions about the entire process for certifying aircraft in the United States  There is renewed scrutiny on the closeness between the F A A  and Boeing  The F A A  and Boeing work together to certify planes  The F A A  actually relies heavily on Boeing employees to help certify its aircraft michael barbaroAnd is that basically industry practice  Companies that make these planes work with the Federal Aviation Administration on the approval process natalie kitroeffThat s exactly right michael barbaroHmm natalie kitroeffI mean  folks were talking about this  right  But nobody was kind of raising red flags  I mean  it wasn t like people were up in arms about the way that this certification system works  But now there s been two crashes of the same model in less than five months  And we re hearing more and more from regulators and former regulators about how this close relationship may be too cozy michael barbaroNatalie  what do we know about the role that Boeing s employees played specifically in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max natalie kitroeffWe know that Boeing plays a critical role in helping to certify its aircraft  And we are learning more and more about the role that it played in the case of the 737 Max  The Seattle Times recently reported that not only was the F A A  relying heavily on Boeing in this case  but that Boeing itself was turning out an analysis that was downplaying the potential risks of a software system that is now at issue after these two crashes michael barbaroHmm natalie kitroeffThe F A A   like any federal agency  has a limited budget  And there s a reason why it would want to rely on the people who are most informed about the inner workings of increasingly complex aircraft in order to determine whether that plane is airworthy  You can see why you would need a relationship  and one where there is a lot of information sharing  right  Because the one side can t employ as many people as Boeing does  And the other side has a ton of expertise  But is that relationship too close michael barbaroRight  And there seems to be a lot of trust at the center of this system you re describing that allows Boeing to basically be like a co regulator of itself  And the most important trust involved here seems to be that a business will always put safety above profits  And I guess the question here is whether in a system with that much trust  that balance could get out of whack  and safety might lose out to profits  And the only way we would know that is when there s a tragedy or two tragedies natalie kitroeffBoeing doesn t want planes to crash  So their motivations are  in many ways  exactly aligned with their customers   But what s emerged after these two crashes   I mean  you heard the pilots  They said this was a breach of trust michael barbaroRight natalie kitroeffI think a lot of people are feeling that right now  that feeling of questioning of this process  And this isn t to say anything about Boeing s motivations  We are at the very beginning of investigating these two flights  and we do not want to rush to conclusions  But you re asking the questions that the people at the front line of this industry  the pilots  the crew  they re asking that right now  How do we regain trust in Boeing  And how do we know for sure that we are being told everything we need to know in order to fly these planes michael barbaroWe ve been talking about trust  the trust that the F A A  had in Boeing  that the airlines  their pilots and crews had or didn t have in this plane  But I m wondering now about the trust that we  as the flying public  have in these planes  And it s kind of hard to imagine wanting to fly on a 737 Max anytime soon  Let s say that the software gets fixed  And Boeing and the F A A   through their certification process  they all sign off on everything being safe  Why should we trust them after that  Why should we trust them  kind of  ever natalie kitroeffI think that coming up with the software fix is manageable for Boeing  an industrial juggernaut that has dealt with these issues before  And you ll remember  the 787 Dreamliner was grounded for three months in 2013  when it had battery fire problems michael barbaroAnd that was a Boeing plane natalie kitroeffRight  a Boeing plane  And we all fly on it  It s possible that people will be wary right now  But Boeing has the capacity to fix this thing and probably will  The bigger question is whether these two tragedies lead to a more wholesale transformation in the process for regulating the aircraft manufacturers in this country  What  if anything  is going to change in the process by which we determine  in the United States  that planes are safe to fly  music michael barbaroNatalie  thank you very much natalie kitroeffThank you  Michael The Federal Aviation Administration certified the 737 Max 8 in 2017  and a key question now is the role that Boeing employees played in the certification process The F A A  has long relied on outside experts known as designees to help approve new aircraft  and in 2005  it established a program through which plane makers like Boeing could choose their own employees to act on the agency s behalf in helping to certify new models The program is meant to allow the F A A  to focus its limited resources on the most crucial work  but critics have questioned whether it essentially allows plane makers to serve as their own regulators Mr  Garneau said the Canadian government would also examine any alterations that Boeing made to the planes  software regardless of F A A  certification  as is the normal procedure Just the suggestion that Canada has doubts about the F A A  s certification of the planes is a significant change from last week  When Mr  Garneau announced that he was banning the Max series aircraft from Canadian skies on Wednesday  he also praised the professionalism of the F A A  With respect to safety  we are very comfortable with the fact that they are the certifying agency   he said at a news conference By mutual agreement  Canada and the United States have accepted the other s certifications for its planes  The F A A  has been something that Canada would follow to a considerable degree   said Karl Moore  a business professor at McGill University in Montreal who closely follows the aviation industry   So I would view this as a considerable shift  While Mr  Garneau did not offer any specific reason for his department s review  Professor Moore said it might be linked to questions around Boeing s relationship with the F A A  as well as concerns about the certification of the Max series The F A A  and Boeing have been adamant for the last week that the certification process is working well  and neither has suggested that any changes are planned  After the crash in Ethiopia  the F A A  said its  aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs  
Gail Collins  Bret  as always we ve got a lot to talk about  The mass shooting in New Zealand  of course  But perhaps we can get started with something less painful  Everybody s been talking about that college admissions scandal  What s your take Bret Stephens  We definitely should get to talking about the terrorism in Christchurch  not only in its own right  as terrible as that is  but because we know it could easily have happened here  even if  in this instance  it took place thousands of miles away As for the admissions scandal  where to start  With the kids  I guess  who clearly didn t deserve the parents to whom they were born and will be socially and emotionally scarred by this fiasco for many years  And even more so with the kids whose names we ll never know and who were denied admission because beneficiaries of the cheating had taken their place at these schools Gail  As a matter of justice  I totally agree  I m just not sure how much practical difference it makes where you wind up in college  This comes partly from our colleague Frank Bruni s book on the subject  and partly from the fact that I went to a school that was  at the time  pretty mediocre  It worked out fine  so maybe I m biased But let s get back to the justice part Bret  At the next level there are the scammers themselves  starting with William Singer  who ran the business fake charity that perpetrated the fraud  and everyone he enlisted to participate in it  including the athletic coaches and fraudulent test takers and so on  In some ways  they re the least interesting part of the story  because their motive was money and their method was fraud  Even so  I m still a little stunned by the thought of the fraudulent test takers who may be smart enough to ace an SAT for someone else but not smart enough to know that cheating is wrong  It s another reminder that there is no correlation between a high IQ and a basic moral sense Gail  The idea of the students not realizing their parents were gaming the system for them does fall apart when you ve got somebody else taking your SATs for you  Bret  Well  I suspect there are ways of gaming that  too  but we ll have to learn more About the parents  I have three kids and I totally get how natural it is to want the best for them   to put opportunities before them  develop their interests and do what you can to help and comfort them when they stumble  But a major part of raising children is setting an example for ethical behavior  And teaching them to accept that disappointment is not just an inevitable part of life but also  if you learn from it  a salutary part of it  And underlining that anything gained through cheating is not gained at all Finally  I guess  there s the meta lesson here about what this says about the way we live now and our social values  I m reluctant to draw too large a moral from a scam in which only a tiny fraction of people participated  But there s no doubt we ve become a society that increasingly has a hard time distinguishing between the substance of a serious university education and the supposed benefits of a prestigious brand  All I can say is that my mom never went to college and she s a heck of a lot wiser and savvier than I am Gail  And you know  Bret  you never can tell how these things are going to work out  As I said  I went to a Catholic school that was  back in the day  not on a top rung  It was the kind of place where the girls had curfews  everybody had to take theology classes and we were forbidden to invite a poet   Allen Ginsberg  in this particular case   to give a reading because he had an immoral outlook   I suspect the gay thing was a big factor  Bret  Starving  hysterical  naked  Go on Gail  Anyhow  the place was so rigid it propelled me into a rebellion   lots of demonstrations for free speech and a boycotting of our ethics of journalism class  I could go on  But the bottom line was I had a wonderful time  made friends for life and developed a sense of confidence I never would have felt if I d been surrounded by supercool high achievers and a sympathetic administration Wouldn t necessarily recommend that for everybody  but I do think there are a lot of kids who would bloom much faster in a nonelite academic institution Bret  Totally agree  One of the problems with elite universities is that they accustom students to a sense of prestige that s both superficial and inhibits a certain kind of risk taking and genuine nonconformity  Obviously that s not universally true but it is hard to move off the beaten path when the one before you seems well lit and glittering  It s also a truism that failure is life s great teacher  and whatever else the beneficiaries of the cheating may get  they are being deprived of something ultimately more valuable The larger question is whether this scandal exposes how rotten the entire enterprise of higher education has become  I personally think the four year college model is crazy   it should be three years  as it is in England  And that s just for starters  We need to reinvent the model root to branch  That s one of the reasons I m against making college available to all  You are merely funneling more students into a system of increasingly dubious value Gail  Kids who can t afford to go to college and who would benefit from college should get government funding  But the loan system is a different question  It s worrisome  I ve always wondered if high school graduates should have to work a year or two   volunteer programs count   before they can commit to an expensive education Bret  Agree completely  Frankly every 18 year old at any level of income would benefit from a year of service of some sort  I know I would have  and I d love to see my children take a gap year or two before college Gail  Our current government loan program is terrible  It helps schools grow by building up unnecessary programs and of course encourages kids to take out huge debt they ll be dragging around for half their lives  The for profit schools are the most egregious offenders  Many of them rake in a ton of money by making promises they can t deliver on   great high paying jobs that never materialize  I m not sure students should even be able to get federal loans for for profit schools  What do you think Bret  I don t share your profound skepticism regarding for profit schools  but I think you re right on this point  The federal government should not be indirectly subsidizing for profit entities  period  especially when they have a questionable track record of achieving the results they promise  Then again  I m skeptical of federal student loans in general  because I think they help drive up the cost of tuition  exacerbating the problem they re intended to solve But let s turn to the appalling attack in New Zealand  One thing that struck me is that  as soon as it was learned that the killer owned his firearms legally  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said   Our gun laws will change   I only wish we had that kind of common sense here in the U S Gail  The death toll in New Zealand is now up to 50  Less than two years ago we lost 58 people in a mass shooting in Las Vegas  Do you remember what our president said about gun laws then  He said   We re not going to talk about that today  We won t talk about that  Our only options are to just moan   I live in a crazy country   and let it go  or to soldier on  So let s give a cheer for the Americans who devote their lives to struggling for better gun regulation I know you re a supporter  Any thoughts about how we could push the cause forward Bret  You know I have my doubts about piecemeal  state by state gun regulation because strong gun laws in  say  Illinois won t matter much if someone can easily purchase a weapon in nearby Indiana  That s why I ve been banging a drum to repeal the Second Amendment  That amendment was written when a competent soldier could fire his weapon perhaps once or twice a minute  Today s mass killers are using weapons that allow them to kill dozens of people in the same amount of time  and that s not even with a fully automatic weapon Gail  This is where I express full agreement without any hope whatsoever  This is a country that hasn t been able to pass a constitutional amendment saying women are equal to men Bret  It is staggering that we ve come to accept as normal the mass murder of scores of people in places like Squirrel Hill  Orlando  Las Vegas  Sandy Hook  Sutherland Springs  Aurora and Parkland simply because unhinged men  acting from whatever motive  have access to these weapons  We should have an annual day of national mourning for victims of gun violence  Perhaps on the anniversary of Columbine Gail  I like that idea Bret  This seems to me a more fruitful avenue of political action than another long conversation about hate  Of course we need to be on our guard against every manifestation of white nationalism  just as we are when it comes to jihadism and every other form of violent extremism  But the issue now is that one evil person can kill dozens of innocent people on any given day  and we are almost powerless to stop him Gail  What we need is so simple   strong background checks on gun purchases  a ban on rapid fire weapons that make it easy to mow down dozens of people  But I wonder sometimes if we could up the ante  Require that everybody who buys a gun has to be able to demonstrate both an understanding of gun safety and a minimal level of marksmanship  The one thing we don t talk about is how inept many gun owners are  You need a decent amount of skill to be able to hit a target  particularly if you re nervous or on the move  Unless  of course  your target is a mass of people at prayer Bret  And while we are at it  a psychiatric evaluation  I d rather allow guns to people who can think straight  even if they don t shoot straight Gail  Before we go  any predictions on what happens next in Washington  It doesn t seems like there s much chance they ll override the president s veto of that bill aimed at keeping him from declaring a wall emergency Bret  None  And it is particularly disappointing to see a Republican like Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska  a so called constitutional conservative  vote with the president just weeks after he delivered a statement denouncing the national emergency declaration  It means that Republicans have no higher principle than their own political self preservation So now it will be up to the Supreme Court to act to defend the separation of powers  Don t be surprised if Chief Justice John Roberts or another conservative justice delivers the majority opinion against the president  along with the court s liberal wing  As we both know  the Trump presidency

OXON HILL  Md    President Trump said on Saturday that he planned to issue an executive order that would help guarantee free speech at colleges and universities by putting their federal aid at risk if they do not protect the viewpoints of students of all political stripes The president made the announcement during a rambling two hour speech to activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington  but he did not provide any details about the possible executive order  Several White House officials did not respond to emails or telephone calls seeking additional information The White House did not respond to questions about when the president might sign the order The issue of free speech on college campuses has for years been a cause célèbre among young conservative activists  who point to instances around the country in which conservative voices have been shunned by liberal students and professors The crowd  which included many college age conservatives  welcomed Mr  Trump s announcement  leaping to their feet when he pledged to hold school administrators accountable for ensuring that conservatives were permitted to express their views on campuses  often places where liberals outnumber them The president cited the case of Hayden Williams  a young activist who was beaten up last month as he was recruiting for a conservative organization at the University of California  Berkeley   long one of the leading centers of liberal academic thought  If they want our dollars  and we give it to them by the billions  they ve got to allow people like Hayden and many great young people  and old people  to speak   Mr  Trump said  drawing huge applause Mr  Trump invited Mr  Williams  who was in the audience  to address the crowd briefly  calling him strong and urging him to sue the university because of the episode  Mr  Williams thanked the president for supporting young conservatives such as himself Floyd Abrams  a leading First Amendment lawyer  expressed concern about the president s proposed executive order  The visage of the most congenitally anti free speech administration in American history making a series of decisions as to which campus conduct is pro  or anti free speech is more than alarming   Mr  Abrams said in an email Saturday afternoon The president has raised a similar threat before  implying he would withhold federal funds from Berkeley after it canceled a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos  a conservative speaker and professional provocateur Students at multiple campuses threatened to boycott events where Mr  Yiannopoulos was to speak  forcing them to cancel the appearances In 2017  at Claremont McKenna College  a private liberal arts school in Southern California  about 250 people blocked entrances to an auditorium where Heather Mac Donald  a conservative writer who has criticized the Black Lives Matter movement  was speaking That same year  students at Middlebury College in Vermont disrupted a speech by Charles Murray  a scholar known for his 1994 book   The Bell Curve   which links socioeconomic status with race and intelligence  Protesters chanted   racist  sexist  anti gay  Charles Murray  go away  It is unclear how Mr  Trump s executive order would change that dynamic  though he hinted that universities and colleges would have to do more to prevent such demonstrations or risk the loss of grant money that the institutions receive from the federal government to support research He said the executive order would  require colleges to support free speech if they want federal research  funding It is not clear how long the idea has been under consideration at the White House or whether the president decided to pursue an executive order because of the episode involving Mr  Williams  which Fox News and other conservative outlets covered extensively It is also unclear how much the president can withhold federal aid to colleges without congressional action  Previous discussions of that issue in conservative circles have focused on passing legislation to change the requirements for colleges to request grant funding from the federal government Mr  Trump made the announcement during one of the longest speeches he has ever delivered  speaking for more than two hours to the thousands of activists at the conclusion of the three day annual convention The campaign like speech touched on dozens of hot button issues  including illegal immigration  The president accused  open border  Democrats of letting murderers  rapists and drug dealers into the country  They give us some very bad people   people with big  long crime records   he said of Central American countries including Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador   Murderers  Killers  Drug dealers  Human traffickers  It s so sad to see how stupid we have been  More than two years after he took office  Mr  Trump once again insisted that his inaugural crowd was larger than his critics have admitted  He bragged about the state of the economy and denounced Democrats who he said supported socialism He denigrated the trade deals made by previous politicians and boasted about the tariffs that the United States had imposed on China and other countries  And he repeatedly mocked the  new green deal  offered by some Democrats  saying it would destroy the economy and take away people s cars and airplanes  Somebody described it as a high school term paper  written by a poor student   he joked 
MEXICO CITY   Mexican officials are carrying out the Trump administration s immigration agenda across wide stretches of the border  undercutting the Mexican government s promises to defend migrants and support their search for a better life The Mexican authorities are blocking groups of migrants at border towns  refusing to allow them onto international bridges to apply for asylum in the United States  intercepting unaccompanied minors before they can reach American soil  and helping to manage lists of asylum seekers on behalf of the American authorities to limit the number of people crossing the border Breaking with decades of asylum practice  the Mexican government has also allowed the Trump administration to send more than 120 men  women and children to Tijuana while they await decisions on their asylum applications in the United States  The program could be expanded to other border crossings as soon as next week Officials inside the administration of Mexico s new president  Andrés Manuel López Obrador  have called his stance on migrants a strategic decision not to anger President Trump He doesn t believe he can change Mr  Trump s mind  they contend  Furthermore  the officials say  Mr  López Obrador has not wanted to jeopardize other aspects of the deeply interconnected relationship between the two countries  ranging from elaborate regional trading arrangements to information sharing on border security  transnational crime and terrorism  So he has avoided a bruising and potentially costly public fight over the issue A lifelong defender of the poor  Mr  López Obrador often refers to his plans for Mexico as a grand transformation  placing his ambitions for the nation on par with those of its great leaders ImageAsylum seekers who have been waiting weeks for their turn to cross from Nuevo Laredo  Mexico  into Laredo  in the United States  camp out on the border crossing bridge in January CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesHe has burnished his everyman credentials by cutting government salaries  flying coach around the country and opening the opulent presidential palace to the public  He has also vastly reduced the number of Central American migrants Mexico deports from its soil But not everything has transformed Exhibit A is the Migrant Protection Protocols  the Trump administration s policy to require asylum seekers to remain on the Mexican side of the border while they await decisions on their fate  Rights groups contend that it dumps migrants in an increasingly violent Mexico and impairs their access to legal counsel and family support in the United States Mr  López Obrador s administration  which came into office saying it would not cooperate with Mr  Trump s anti immigration agenda  has gone along with it on several fronts  including accepting women and children despite earlier promises to take only adult male asylum seekers The Mexican government argued the policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico was imposed on them by the United States and they consented for humanitarian reasons It is also true that for Mr  López Obrador  giving in to some of Mr  Trump s border demands and rarely saying a word against the American president in his daily press briefings carries little political cost at home  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United

dangerous cities in Mexico CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesTo many Mexicans  the fate of migrants is secondary to domestic concerns about jobs  security and corruption  Mr  López Obrador retains an 80 percent approval rating  despite his government s willingness to take back migrants applying for asylum in the United States  If we have to accept a handful of people back into Mexico  that s not really a problem for us  not even politically   said one official who was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations   What we really want to avoid is a public fight with Trump  But in its effort to avoid a cross border fight  the Mexican government has chosen politics over its humanitarian ideals  critics contend  Mexico is continuing to play the role that the U S  thinks it should  which is to contain the migrant influx  period   said Melissa Vertiz Hernández  who coordinates the Working Group on Immigration Policy  a network of civil society and rights groups in Mexico The delicate balance with the United States has left the Mexican government without a clear  consistent immigration policy  so Mexican states and municipalities along the border are often in the position of fending for themselves under pressure from their American counterparts In the Mexican border city of Reynosa  for instance  almost no one is allowed to cross the bridge to apply for asylum in neighboring McAllen  Texas  They are typically blocked or apprehended by Mexican officials  forcing migrants to try their luck in other towns ImageAn orientation session for Mexican migrants  haggard from weeks in detention in the United States  soon after they were deported to Mexico in January CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesIn the city of Piedras Negras  officials rounded up hundreds of migrants who arrived in a caravan in recent weeks and kept them under tight watch in a shelter with limited access to outsiders  advocates say  After a public outcry  the center was closed and many were bused to other cities and towns along the border The mayor of Ciudad Juárez  meanwhile  has threatened to sue a neighboring governor for shipping migrants to his town  It has become a game of political hot potato  with desperate Central Americans who are fleeing poverty and violence caught in the middle Elsewhere along the border  shelter officials say they manage lists of asylum applicants by name  nationality  age and documentation to assist Mexican officials who are complying with American border patrol mandates The Mexican government is resisting Mr  Trump in some ways  the official in Mr  López Obrador s government insisted  Even acquiescing to the Trump administration on the Migrant Protection Protocols was done strategically  according to the official and two others briefed on the plan By allowing the program to start in San Diego and Tijuana  the Mexican officials argued  legal challenges to it in the United States go to the federal courts in the Northern District of California  which are generally seen as liberal  This matters at a time when many Americans are focused on how to beat Mr  Trump in the 2020 elections  in particular by leveraging the Mexican American vote But many activists are far from confident that a legal challenge will put an end to the program  I think it s an incredibly risky move   said Stephanie Leutert  the director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin   I don t think you should put your country s foreign and migratory policy in the hands of a civil society organization in another country  ImageMen rest at a migrant shelter by the Rio Grande in Reynosa  Mexico  near the border crossing leading to McAllen  in the United States CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesOn Feb  14  that civil society organization  the American Civil Liberties Union  and several other advocacy groups filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration s policy  A decision on a temporary restraining order is expected in the coming days The lawsuit  filed on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were returned to Mexico in recent weeks  accuses the Trump administration of violating federal and international migration and human rights laws Advocates contend that by forcibly sending asylum seekers to Tijuana  the Trump administration has plunged them into an unfamiliar and dangerous environment where their lives may be in jeopardy Killings in Tijuana have skyrocketed in recent years because of a turf war in the local drug market  In 2018  the city posted its deadliest year on record  with more than 2 500 killings The Trump administration first announced the new policy in December  and on Jan  28 the head of Mexico s migration agency said the Mexican government had imposed restrictions on its enactment But Mexican officials have backed down from many of those initial restrictions  including its refusal to accept women with children  Trump administration officials have said they plan to expand the program to other ports of entry along the border  The López Obrador administration has said little publicly about the changes ImageMembers of the U S  Border Police patrol

returnees   three single men  a single woman  and two mothers each traveling with three children   described their confusion and dismay at finding themselves in Mexico once again  I have no idea how I m going to survive   said Yanira  a 34 year old migrant from El Salvador who feared being pursued by the people she said she was fleeing in her home country Yanira said she left El Salvador with her three children   ages 8  11 and 12   after a local gang tried to recruit her middle child and threatened violence unless he agreed When she stepped onto Mexican soil again after being led back across the border by American officials  she broke down  I cried and cried   she recalled Mexican officials have said they cannot provide shelter and care for the returnees  essentially leaving them to a network of community groups in Tijuana and elsewhere in the state of Baja California But the shelter network has been under extraordinary pressure from the almost continual arrival of migrants traveling in caravans  who have pushed the centers beyond capacity Sister Salomé Limas  a social worker at the Instituto Madre Asunta migrant shelter in Tijuana  said it is currently housing about 120 women and children   in a space designed for 44 Among the migrants are several families who are seeking asylum in the United States and were returned in recent weeks under the Trump policy Sister Salomé said the shelter can house the families until their first court date in the United States  in late March  After that  she is not sure  What s going to happen to them   she said   We don t know

LOS ANGELES   Once again taking aim at President Trump  California on Monday filed its 47th lawsuit against the administration  this time to block a move that would effectively strip millions of federal dollars from reproductive health providers that perform abortions and abortion referrals Attorney General Xavier Becerra  who has become one of Mr  Trump s most aggressive critics  said Monday that the administration s changes to Title X  the federal family planning program  would punish doctors and clinics for giving women a comprehensive portrait of their reproductive options  The administration announced those changes last month  This is 2019  not 1920   Mr  Becerra said in an interview   Jeopardizing the health of women is not what we should be doing in the year 2019  On Monday  20 other states  plus Washington  D C   said they would file a separate lawsuit challenging the same restrictions Millions of low income patients receive reproductive health services each year through Title X  a  286 million federal family planning initiative  Programs that receive Title X funding provide a range of services  including family counseling  preventive health screenings for breast and cervical cancers  contraceptives  and treatment for sexually transmitted infections About 40 percent of the 4 000 clinics nationwide that receive Title X funding are operated by Planned Parenthood The lawsuit by California was filed on Monday just hours after the restrictions devised by the Trump administration were published in the Federal Register It was already against the law for health care providers to use federal funds for abortions  The new rule would prohibit organizations that provide referrals for abortions from accepting any federal funds for family planning  These rules were put in specifically to target Planned Parenthood   said Crystal Strait  the head of the organization s operations in California On a practical level  the administration s order would bar doctors from mentioning the option of an abortion in nearly all cases  Ms  Strait said  This builds a wall between a doctor and her patients   Ms  Strait said   We ve never in the United States accepted that  When you go into your physician  you expect to get medically accurate options  Clinics that receive federal funds can provide patients with a list of primary health care providers  including those that provide prenatal care  but cannot identify which ones on the list  if any  perform abortions The final rule also requires a complete separation of family planning and abortion services at clinics that offer both  Federal health officials estimate that 10 to 20 percent of Title X sites do not comply and would have to spend an average of  20 000 each to meet the requirement The new requirements would effectively redirect Planned Parenthood s  60 million in yearly funding to faith based and alternative providers unless its clinics dramatically changed the way they operate Anti abortion organizations applauded the administration s rule change Patrina Mosley  the director of Life  Culture and Women s Advocacy at the conservative Family Research Council  said clinics like Planned Parenthood s had been operating  against the very statute for which the money is intended  by providing referrals for abortions She said Monday s lawsuits were frustrating but not surprising   When the administration does something that the left doesn t like  they go to court   she said   This is the habitual pattern  The change  critics argue  threatens to leave women without a full understanding of their reproductive options Gov  Kate Brown of Oregon  a Democrat  criticized the new rule as  another attack from the Trump administration on women and families   Oregon is leading the coalition of states that plan to challenge the rule in a separate lawsuit on Tuesday California would be hit particularly hard by the administration s order  Mr  Becerra said  Of the four million women affected by the ruling nationwide  more than one million are in California  he said  Playing politics with that care is dangerous and grossly irresponsible   Gov  Gavin Newsom said in a statement   Our mothers  wives  sisters and daughters deserve better  
WASHINGTON   Intelligence officials who brief the president have warned him about Chinese espionage in bottom line business terms  They have used Black Sea shipping figures to demonstrate the effect of Russia s aggression in Ukraine  And they have filled the daily threat briefing with charts and graphs of economic data In an effort to accommodate President Trump  who has  attacked them publicly as  naïve  and in need of going  back to school   the nation s intelligence agencies have revamped their presentations to focus on subjects their No  1 customer wants to hear about   economics and trade Intelligence officers  steeped in how Mr  Trump views the world  now work to answer his repeated question  Who is winning  What the president wants to know  according to former officials  is what country is making more money or gaining a financial advantage While the professionals do not criticize Mr  Trump s focus  they do question whether those interests are crowding out intelligence on threats like terrorism and the maneuvers of traditional adversaries  developments with foreign militaries or geopolitical events with international implications  If Trump tailors it to his needs  that is fine and his prerogative   Douglas H  Wise  a career C I A  official and a former top deputy at the Defense Intelligence Agency  said of the daily briefing   However  if he suppresses intelligence through that tailoring  that is not helpful  He is no longer making informed decisions because he is making decisions based on information he could have had but didn t have  Presidents have long shaped their intelligence briefings based on their interests and the issues of the moment   be it a Cold War with the Soviet Union or Al Qaeda and terrorism  Other presidents have also told intelligence agencies to focus more on economics  After his election  President Bill Clinton told his briefers that he wanted more economic information  And during the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis  President Barack Obama had an economic intelligence briefing created to supplement the daily intelligence briefing Mr  Trump  finding traditional intelligence briefings less helpful than his predecessors  reduced the in person briefings to about twice a week  Those sessions from Dan Coats  the director of national intelligence  and Gina Haspel  the C I A  director  now feature far more charts and visual aids to appeal to Mr  Trump  according to a senior intelligence official  President Trump s economic focus has been evident  including his emphasis on increasing NATO allies  burden sharing and pressing allies and partners to do more in support of our common interests   said Garrett Marquis  a spokesman for the National Security Council The written reports are still delivered daily to John R  Bolton  the national security adviser  who conveys the highlights to Mr  Trump on days when the intelligence chiefs are not at the Oval Office  according to a former official The regular briefings have been a cornerstone of how intelligence officers inform the president since the days of President Harry S  Truman  President Obama and President George W  Bush also received such briefings daily For 73 years  geopolitical trends  warnings and high level gossip have been delivered to the White House regularly by the C I A  and other intelligence agencies in the form of what is today known as the President s Daily Brief  or P D B  Once a thick binder of reports  the P D B  is now presented on a secure tablet computer and produced six days a week by officials at the C I A  and other intelligence agencies ImageSteel pipes in Germany that will be used to construct a pipeline to transport Russian natural gas arriving from the Nord Stream 2  Mr  Trump has

day  the briefers would describe terrorist threats in the Middle East  worry about the North Korean nuclear program or get the results of covert missions around the world Some of what bores Mr  Trump in traditional intelligence briefings  according to former officials  are the detailed analyses of the activities and motivations of secondary foreign officials  The president wants information about the leader of various countries  not the underlings But the president has also shown less interest in details about potential terrorist plots or cloak and dagger spy work   the kind of secret information that excites most officials  In his view  too little traditional intelligence analysis examines economics and trade as a fundamental driver of international conflict   Economic security at home goes hand in hand with national security abroad   said Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council So in security briefings  Mr  Trump peppers officials with questions about economic competition with China  including Beijing s efforts to gain technological superiority and to achieve trade advantages over the United States He has also shown a fascination with Angela Merkel  the German chancellor  repeatedly asking why she will not cut a deal with him on military spending despite his advisers  explanation that the German government s coalition agreement constrains Ms  Merkel s ability to increase defense funding  And he has pressed his intelligence briefers on why Berlin is allowing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Russia to go forward if Germany is truly worried about Moscow s aggression Mr  Trump has also repeatedly spoken to intelligence and military briefers about the cost of American bases overseas and the defense expenditures of allies in Europe and Asia  according to White House officials The president s push also has national security officials thinking about the economic angles of international flash points  When Russia seized Ukranian sailors and ships in the Sea of Azov  officials in Washington began studying the implications to shipping  White House officials argued that the Europeans would have the most leverage given their dominance of the industry  But they also argued that by raising the costs of shipping  the Russians were  shooting themselves in the foot   a senior administration official said Intelligence officials have always adapted their briefings to the needs and interests of the current president  But they have never faced a challenge like Mr  Trump  who by virtue of his background and experience  views the intelligence agencies with deep skepticism The president has publicly clashed with intelligence briefers over their assessments of the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea  He has also privately complained after national security briefings that   My generals don t understand business   according to a former administration official Senator Angus King  the Maine independent who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee  said Mr  Trump s criticism of his briefers could inflict real damage  It threatens to intimidate agencies into softening their analysis or not delivering information that the president needs to hear  he said  The problem   Mr  King said   is the message sent to agencies   Don t tell me information I don t want to hear   Mr  Trump s skepticism of traditional intelligence stretches back to his untraditional path to the presidency  his campaign and his early days in the White House ImageAmerican soldiers at Osan Air Base in South Korea  Mr  Trump has repeatedly spoken to intelligence and military briefers about the cost of American bases overseas CreditPool photo by Kim Hong JiTwo weeks before Mr  Trump took office  the top intelligence chiefs   including the heads of the F B I   the C I A  and the N S A    briefed Mr  Trump and his team at Trump Tower on the agencies  findings that Russia was behind the election meddling  The issue was a touchy matter  Mr  Trump saw any evidence that Russia helped get him elected as an attack on his legitimacy  After the briefing  the F B I  director at the time  James B  Comey  pulled Mr  Trump aside Mr  Comey told the president that the bureau was given a dossier that showed the Russians may have compromising information on him  The disclosure unnerved Mr  Trump and deepened his suspicions of the intelligence community Some former officials say Mr  Trump s view of the competence of the intelligence agencies has improved  largely because of the work of Ms  Haspel and her predecessor at the C I A   Mike Pompeo  now the secretary of state But as Mr  Trump s recent criticism of the intelligence chiefs on Twitter demonstrated  he is still frustrated  That is partially because many of his world views are strongly held  He has shown little willingness  over the long term  to alter those opinions The tension with the intelligence agencies is also a reflection of Mr  Trump s status as the ultimate outsider convinced that the Washington establishment s way of doing business is broken and flawed  He really doesn t have a lot of respect for the intellectual  professional class   said Walter Russell Mead  a fellow at the Hudson Institute   Intelligence agencies are bureaucracies  so what the president is getting is this kind of curated feed  The agencies attach a high value on how they do these things  But that is not Trump  While other presidents have frequently disagreed privately with their intelligence briefers  they did not challenge them publicly  said Michael Morell  a former top C I A  official who has briefed Presidents Clinton  Bush and Obama  Bush would say   Michael  I don t agree with what you are saying   then we would have a back and forth and we would discuss it   said Mr  Morell  who now hosts the  Intelligence Matters  podcast   Obama would say the same thing  But that discussion was substantive  It wasn t based on whether something is consistent with your worldview or the policy line you have taken  James R  Clapper Jr   President Obama s director of national intelligence  conducted twice weekly briefings for Mr  Obama  leaving the remaining daily sessions to others  Mr  Obama was a faithful reader of the P D B   so the briefings with intelligence officers did not cover the written material but instead offered supplementary material and updates Mr  Clapper said that when Mr  Trump became the Republican nominee and began receiving intelligence briefings  it was apparent that  a very different approach  would be needed because Mr  Trump was not a reader  So the briefers quickly adjusted to verbal presentations  stressing big points and wherever possible  graphics   Mr  Clapper said   That s not a negative comment since all presidents have their own style of absorbing information  Some former administration officials said Mr  Trump s focus on asking economic questions was just a different form of what his predecessors had done  It is not the president s job to adapt to the P D B    said David Priess  a former C I A  officer and briefer who wrote  The President s Book of Secrets    It is the job of intelligence officers to adapt the P D B  to the president  
This is the way the trade war ends  Not with a bang but with empty bombast According to multiple news organizations  the U S  and China are close to a deal that would effectively end trade hostilities  Under the reported deal  America would remove most of the tariffs it imposed last year  China  for its part  would end its retaliatory tariffs  make some changes to its investment and competition policies and direct state enterprises to buy specified amounts of U S  agricultural and energy products The Trump administration will  of course  trumpet the deal as a triumph  In reality  however  it s much ado about nothing much  As described  the deal would do little to address real complaints about Chinese policy  which mainly involve China s systematic expropriation of intellectual property  Nor would it do much to address Donald Trump s pet although misguided peeve  the imbalance in U S  China trade  Basically  Trump will have backed down If this is the story  it will repeat what we saw on the North American Free Trade Agreement  which Trump denounced as the  worst trade deal ever made   In the end  what Trump negotiated   the U S  Mexico Canada Agreement  or U S M C A    was very similar to the previous status quo  Trade experts I know  when not referring to it as the Village People agreement  call it  Nafta 0 8   fundamentally the same as Nafta  but a bit worse  Paul Krugman did explanatory journalism before it was cool  moving from a career as a world class economist to writing hard hitting opinion columns  For an even deeper look at what s on his mind  sign up for his weekly newsletter  Why is the president who famously declared that  trade wars are good  and easy to win  effectively waving the white flag  Mainly because winning turns out not to be easy  at all  Trump s beloved stock market hates talk of trade war  There is no broad constituency for protectionism   in fact  public opinion has become much more pro free trade under Trump  And Chinese retaliation has hit hard at voting blocs Trump depends on  especially in farm states Now  agreement with China isn t a done deal  Trump may also yet open another front in the trade war  against European automobiles  And the Village People agreement awaits congressional approval  and it s not clear what Trump will do if that isn t forthcoming Still  it looks possible  even likely  that within a few months most though not all of the trade war will have been unwound  So will it all look in retrospect like a passing storm  with few long term consequences No  it won t  Even if most of the tariffs go away  Trump s trade belligerence has done lasting damage to America s reputation  and hence to a global economy that depends on American leadership  The whole world now knows two things about us  First  we re not reliable   an agreement with the U S  is really just a suggestion  because you never know when the president will invent some excuse for breaking it  Second  we re easily rolled  The president may talk tough on trade  but in classic bully fashion  he runs away if confronted On U S  unreliability  consider the way the current administration has treated Canada  probably the friendliest neighbor and firmest ally any nation has ever had  Despite generations of good relations and a free trade agreement  Trump imposed large tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel  invoking national security as a justification  This was obviously specious   in fact  Trump himself basically conceded this point  justifying the tariffs instead as retaliation for Canadian dairy policy  which was also specious   The lesson for the world is that America can t be trusted  Why bother making deals with a country that s willing to slap sanctions on the best of allies  and clearly lie about the reasons  whenever it feels like it Meanwhile  the sudden retreat in the confrontation with China shows that we talk loud but carry a small stick  It would be one thing if the U S  had changed course on the merits  But backing down so easily  after all the posturing  tells the world that the way to deal with America is not to bargain in good faith  but simply to threaten the president s political base  and maybe offer some payoffs  political and otherwise   I m still wondering about those floors China s largest bank rents at Trump Tower  And when it comes to payoffs  autocracies have an advantage over nations that observe the rule of law  China appears to be getting most Trump tariffs removed  Canada still faces those steel tariffs Finally  by undermining the international system  America is making the world worse for itself as well as for everyone else  In fact  payback is coming right away  The World Trade Organization just gave America a big win in a dispute over Chinese agricultural subsidies   but its verdict is probably moot  because the Trump administration has spent the past two years denigrating the organization  and has crippled the appellate body that is supposed to enforce W T O  rulings  blocking the appointments that would have given this trade court the quorum it needs to act Let s be clear  Not having a trade war is better than the alternative  But the path the Trump administration has taken to its trade deals has made us less trusted  less respected and weaker than we were before  So much winning The Times is committed

A perjurer soon to be serving three years in prison had a great many charges to level against President Trump on Wednesday  Michael Cohen  once the president s personal lawyer  told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform of misbehavior and possibly criminal conduct on the part of his former client ranging from paying off mistresses and lying about a real estate deal in Moscow to inflating the value of his assets for insurance purposes and deflating them when paying his taxes  Yet Mr  Cohen testified that he had no evidence of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia and was never explicitly ordered by Mr  Trump to lie to Congress  Mr  Cohen had inferred  however  that Mr  Trump wanted him to lie  Mr  Cohen s lies under oath are one of the reasons he is headed to a federal prison For all the sensationalism and political excitement of Mr  Cohen s testimony  it is worth remembering that Mr  Trump has not  in fact  been found guilty of any crime  something that cannot be said about his former lawyer  Would any of the president s critics credit Mr  Cohen s veracity if he were testifying in support of his former employer  rather than against him  Whatever you think about Donald Trump  Michael Cohen simply is not an honest person  The idea that he suddenly becomes one as soon as he has something bad to say about the president is far fetched  to say the least High profile congressional hearings are show business  and this one was no exception  It bears comparison with the highly politicized hearings that a Republican controlled Congress held during the Obama administration  looking into such matters as arms sales to Mexican drug cartels as part of a botched sting strategy by the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms  Operation Fast and Furious  and conflicting State Department claims about the circumstances of the 2012 attack by Islamist militants on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi  Libya  The latter saw Republicans in 2015 call the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi  The political significance of the hearing was obvious But Benghazi and Fast and Furious were real policy scandals involving life or death matters  The Cohen hearing  by contrast  was little more than an opportunity for scattershot attacks on the president and his business dealings  It was hardly a focused investigation into Russian collusion  supposedly the central concern of the president s critics  It was seven hours of innuendo  speculation and largely unsupported allegations about wrongdoing and offensive behavior of whatever sort Mr  Cohen or his congressional interlocutors cared to bring up  Mr  Cohen had copies of checks that he had received to reimburse him for his payments to Stormy Daniels  buying her silence about her affairs with Mr  Trump  Sex  money and secrecy are titillating  but are the prosecutors of the Southern District of New York really going to be able to find a campaign finance crime here  Maybe they will make a case  Mr  Cohen s testimony certainly did not  The hearing was sleaze for the sake of pure partisan pleasure  not a serious attempt at uncovering lawbreaking There is scant possibility that anything Mr  Cohen said Wednesday will even be grounds for Democrats to attempt impeachment  Some in the party are eager to do to President Trump what Republicans did to Bill Clinton 20 years ago  But if impeaching a president for lying under oath about sex was partisan overreach then  impeaching President Trump now  when not even that much legal wrongdoing on his part has been proved  would be absurd  Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives seem to understand this Impeaching a president is a thoroughly partisan endeavor  as the only two impeachments that have gone to trial in the Senate  those of Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson  demonstrated  But up to now   high crimes and misdemeanors  has involved at least some basis in legal fact   President Clinton s perjury or President Johnson s defiance of the Tenure of Office Act  Mr  Cohen s claims about coded signals from President Trump indicating that he should lie to Congress fall short of the probative value of a stained blue dress More public hearings are to come  though Mr  Cohen s next appearance on Capitol Hill will be to testify for another session behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee  Republicans did a poor job getting to the heart of the Benghazi fiasco when they held the gavels before the 2016 election  But at least the G O P  was investigating a scandal related to policy  The Democrats  most high profile investigations are personal  They might say that is because President Trump is personally corrupt  On the other hand  while Democrats may find much to dislike about this president s policies  he has suffered no policy debacles like Benghazi or Fast and Furious  Unemployment is low  wages are rising  and the country is as close to peace as it ever has been since the  War on Terror  began  Whether or not there is proof of Russian collusion or crooked business dealings  the president s opponents may have to keep their focus on his personal affairs because in seeing to the nation s interests  he has been embarrassingly successful more Views on the cohen hearingOpinion   Peter Wehner  Republicans Sink Further Into

Say this for Donald Trump  He s provided us with many iconic quotations  which will surely be repeated in histories and textbooks for decades if not generations to come  Unfortunately  they ll be repeated because they are extremely clear examples of bad ideas In economics  the line you hear most is Trump s declaration that  trade wars are good  and easy to win   Coming in second is his assertion that  I am a Tariff Man   coupled with the claim that foreigners pay the tariffs he has been imposing Now  that last claim is something you can test  Over the course of 2018 Trump imposed tariffs on about 12 percent of total U S  imports  and many of those tariffs have been in effect long enough that we can get a first read on their consequences On Saturday economists from Columbia  Princeton  and the New York Federal Reserve released a paper   The impact of the 2018 trade war on U S  prices and welfare   that used detailed import data to assess the tariffs  impact   The paper  by the way  is a beautiful piece of work   The conclusion  to a first approximation  foreigners paid none of the bill  U S  companies and consumers paid all of it  And the losses to U S  consumers exceeded the revenue from the new tariffs  so the tariffs made America poorer overall How did they get this result  The U S  government collects data on the prices and quantities of many categories of imports  Many of these categories faced new tariffs  but many others didn t  So you can compare what happened to the tariffed imports to the de facto control group of untouched imports  this tells you the impact of the tariffs Under Trump s vision  in which foreigners would have paid the tariffs  what you would have expected to see is falling prices for tariffed goods  offsetting the tariff  so that consumer prices didn t change  What you actually see  however  is no visible effect of the tariffs on import prices  So foreign suppliers don t seem to have absorbed any of the tariffs  which were fully passed on to consumers  tariff inclusive prices  Figure 1  have risen by the full amounts of the tariffs ImageFigure 1CreditAmiti et al  2019 These price hikes led to substantial changes in behavior  Imports of the tariffed items fell sharply  partly because consumers turned to domestic products  but also in large part because importers shifted their sourcing to countries that aren t currently facing Trump tariffs  For example  a number of companies already seem to have begun buying goods they previously bought from China from Vietnam or Mexico instead These changes in behavior are the key to the paper s conclusion that the tariffs have made America poorer Consider the following example  pre tariff  the U S  imports some good from China that costs  100  Then the Trump administration imposes a 25  tariff  raising the price to consumers to  125  If we just keep importing that good from China  consumers lose  25 per unit purchased   but the government raises an extra  25 in taxes  leaving overall national income unchanged Suppose  however  that importers shift to a more expensive source that isn t subject to the tariff  suppose  for example  that they can buy the good from Vietnam for  115  Then consumers only lose  15   but there is no tariff revenue  so that  15 is a loss for the nation as a whole But what if they turn to a domestic supplier   say  a U S  company that will sell the product for  120  How does this change the story Here the crucial thing is that producing a good domestically has an opportunity cost  The U S  is near full employment  so the  120 in resources used to produce that good could and would have been employed producing something else in the absence of the tariff  Diverting them into producing what we used to import means a net loss of  20  with no revenue offset By the way  in practice any manufacturing jobs added by the Trump tariffs are probably offset by losses of other manufacturing jobs  Partly that s because most of the tariffs are on intermediate goods   inputs into production  so that job gains in  say  steel are offset by losses in autos and other downstream sectors  Beyond that  the tariffs have probably contributed to a rising dollar  which makes U S  exports less competitive Putting it all together  the Trump tariffs have raised consumer prices  rather than depressing foreign earnings  Some revenue has been gained  but there has also been what amounts to tax avoidance as consumers turn to other  untaxed sources of what we used to import  But this tax avoidance itself comes at a cost  so the U S  as a whole is left poorer Now  the numbers aren t that big  The new paper puts the net welfare loss at  1 4 billion a month  or  17 billion a year  that s less than 0 1 percent of U S  GDP  But winning it isn t  And the numbers could get a lot bigger if the trade war expands  say with a  national security  tariff on European cars The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to

WASHINGTON   The United States and South Korea will suspend two large scale joint military exercises this spring  two American officials said Friday  as part of President Trump s efforts to maintain the truce he has struck with Kim Jong un  the leader of North Korea A limited version of the training drills  however  are still expected to go forward  officials said  The United States and South Korea have long held large scale exercises in the spring  known as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle   the latter of which usually includes thousands of ground  naval  air and special operations troops from both nations The decision to scale back the military exercises follows nuclear talks this week between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kim that ended without an agreement on how   or whether   to shut down North Korea s nuclear weapons program  As the Trump administration continues to seek a resolution  a Defense Department official said  the high profile missile exercises that Pyongyang views as provocative will be toned down The official said the decision to formally suspend the large scale drills was expected to be announced by the United States and South Korea in the next few days  It was first reported by NBC News It is the latest in a series of planned military exercises that Washington and Seoul have canceled in the past year in order to avoid roiling Pyongyang  Mr  Trump has also said that the war drills cost too much Pentagon officials had braced for another suspension after the latest nuclear talks  Suspending exercises can hamper military readiness At the end of the summit meeting in Hanoi  Vietnam  on Thursday  Mr  Trump again called the exercises  very expensive   Look  you know  exercising is fun and it s nice and they play the war games   Mr  Trump told journalists in Hanoi   And I m not saying it s not necessary  because  at some levels  it is  But at other levels  it s not  Last June  without consulting the Pentagon  the president suspended major military exercises with South Korea after meeting Mr  Kim in Singapore  Two months later  Mr  Trump rebuked then Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for opening the door to resuming the exercises Mr  Mattis has since resigned Still  American and South Korean soldiers  airmen and sailors have continued to carry out joint training sessions  In addition  the two sides have staged so called tabletop or virtual exercises that they have not advertised Top military officials acknowledge that in many ways  large scale exercises like Foal Eagle are meant to deter North Korea with a show of force to demonstrate the capabilities of the United States and South Korean militaries 
WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is close to a trade deal with China that would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific but may do little to achieve the substantive changes to China s economy that the United States initially set out to win  people with knowledge of the talks said Significant details remain unsettled and the deal is still being discussed but so far  the two sides have agreed on a pact that would largely require Beijing to make big purchases of American agricultural and energy goods and to lower some barriers that prevent American companies from operating in China  In return  the United States would most likely drop its tariffs on at least  200 billion of the  250 billion worth of Chinese imports currently subject to American levies China  which has retaliated against President Trump s tariffs with its own punishing taxes on American goods  is pushing for the elimination of all of the Trump tariffs  a person with knowledge of the negotiations said  It is unclear whether the Trump administration will agree to remove all the tariffs or keep some in place to keep pressure on China  As part of the agreement  the Trump administration has been pushing China to accept an enforcement mechanism that would enable the United States to quickly reinstate tariffs if Beijing fails to live up to specific promises For Mr  Trump  the ability to announce a deal with China would constitute a victory for a presidency rocked by legal investigations and failed nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea last week  Mr  Trump has spent more than a year accusing China of unfair trade practices and promising to shift the balance of economic power back to the United States The agreement under discussion would expand markets for American financial services firms and farmers  in part by requiring that China buy large amounts of energy and farm goods  like liquid natural gas and soybeans But early details indicate it would do little to substantively change the way China has long done business and would not force Beijing to curtail cybertheft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for American companies The language aimed at China s discrimination against foreign companies  like its antimonopoly law or standard setting processes  is probably too vague to be enforceable  while China s promises on curtailing subsidies are also overly broad  a person familiar with the negotiation said  The pact also doesn t alter China s tight restrictions on data  the person said  In addition  many of the big purchases that Beijing is promising would occur over a number of years  which could give China further leverage during that period  critics say Regardless of what Mr  Trump s negotiators agree upon  no deal will be final until the president signs onto the agreement  Since starting his trade war last year  Mr  Trump has vacillated between accusing China of destroying American jobs and playing up his strong relationship with President Xi Jinping and his ability to reach a trade deal  Mr  Trump recently began dangling a signing event with Mr  Xi at Mar a Lago  the president s resort  and that ceremony seems to be coming together for later this month  While Mr  Trump wanted a summit meeting earlier in the month  the event could occur at the end of March  after Mr  Xi finishes a scheduled trip through Europe  according to people familiar with the discussions China very much wants to present the image that a deal is at hand as several thousand top officials of the Chinese Communist Party and hundreds of the country s most prominent business leaders gathered in Beijing over the weekend for the annual session of the legislature  the National People s Congress  which starts on Tuesday The Chinese government has been willing to discuss moves that it perceives as being in China s interest  from long term purchases of commodities that are needed for Chinese factories to changes in China s foreign investment law that make it a more attractive place for overseas companies to operate  But people familiar with the Chinese government s stance say it is determined to say no to policy changes that do not benefit its interest ImagePresident Trump with China s president  Xi Jinping  in Beijing in November 2017  Any trade deal still needs the approval of both leaders CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesBeijing has carried out most of the legal work needed for the legislature to pass a new  comprehensive law on investment by foreign businesses that would help satisfy some of America s earlier demands  The law will be the framework for China to reduce its limits on foreign stakes in Chinese banks  insurers and asset management companies   something that Mr  Xi had agreed to do in November 2017  when Mr  Trump came to Beijing for talks ahead of the trade war In a congressional hearing last week  Robert Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  signaled a long road ahead to reaching an agreement but said the United States would push for a substantive deal that did not merely result in purchases of American goods  What we want is fair trade that requires structural change and it has to be enforceable   Mr  Lighthizer said He said the United States and China were working to establish an enforcement mechanism that would involve an extensive series of meetings at various levels of government and the threat of tariffs if China was found to have violated the trade agreement The Chinese continue to be concerned that  after they have made concessions to get to the brink of a deal  Mr  Trump will be convinced by more hawkish voices in the media or the administration to try to press China for even more  said Eswar Prasad  a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution The trade deal under discussion stems from the Trump administration s findings last March that Beijing was engaging in unfair trade practices  including pressuring or requiring American companies to transfer their technology and intellectual property to Chinese partners as a condition of doing business in the country  The investigation found that China s practices hurt American exports  job numbers and wages Mr  Trump has long attacked China s economic practices  likening it to a  rape of our country  and  the greatest theft in the history of the world  while campaigning for the White House The president has continued to accuse China of engaging in nefarious practices to get a leg up in global trade and has imposed tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods to pressure Beijing to stop  The trade war  which has raged for months  has begun to hurt American companies that depend on China for sales and production  and many large multinational firms have said the trade war will crimp 2019 profits David Loevinger  who was the Treasury s senior coordinator for China affairs in the first term of the Obama administration  said he thought there was too much optimism in China and the United States that a trade deal would roll back most or all of the tariffs that President Trump imposed last year  What s very clear is we ve reached the peak of the tariff war   said Mr  Loevinger  now a managing director for emerging markets at TCW  an asset management company in Los Angeles   The question is how much of a rollback do we get   my expectation is probably not very much  Last week  Mr  Trump said he would delay imposing higher tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods  citing substantial progress in trade talks  On Saturday  Mr  Trump said he was asking China to end its retaliatory tariffs on meat and other products  I have asked China to immediately remove all Tariffs on our agricultural products  including beef  pork  etc   based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with Trade discussions and I did not increase their second traunch of Tariffs to 25  on March 1st   the president wrote Saturday on Twitter   This is very important for our great farmers   and me  
LOUMBILA  Burkina Faso   President Trump has ordered most American troops to withdraw from Syria  He wants to bring home thousands more from Afghanistan  Now hundreds of United States commandos and other forces are leaving West Africa   despite an onslaught of attacks from an increasingly deadly matrix of Islamist fighters The shift has unnerved African commanders in Burkina Faso and neighboring nations in the Sahel  a vast sub Saharan scrubland increasingly racked by bombings  massacres  kidnappings and attacks on hotels frequented by Westerners  It is a region in which most Americans were unaware of United States military involvement until four Army soldiers were killed in a deadly 2017 ambush in Niger by Islamic State fighters What is emerging  critics said  is a glimpse of what happens when American troops  especially Special Operations forces  pull back before insurgents are effectively subdued  leaving local or allied forces to fend off the Islamic State  Al Qaeda or their offshoots  It s a real problem   Col  Maj  Moussa Salaou Barmou  commander of Niger s Special Operations forces  said of the drawdown and the closing of seven of eight American elite counterterrorism

from focusing on counterterrorism operations to potential threats from China and Russia  In December  President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all 2 000 American troops from Syria  although he since has softened it to allow at least 400 remain  A new Pentagon plan also would pull all 14 000 American troops from Afghanistan over the next five years   and as many as 7 000 in coming months   as part of continuing peace talks with the Taliban The American military is scaling back its commandos in Africa by about 25 percent  mainly in the continent s west  At the same time  insurgents are attacking

Jared Kushner slipped quietly into Saudi Arabia this week for a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  so the question I m trying to get the White House to answer is this  Did they discuss American help for a Saudi nuclear program Of all the harebrained and unscrupulous dealings of the Trump administration in the last two years  one of the most shocking is a Trump plan to sell nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia that could be used to make nuclear weapons Even as President Trump is trying to denuclearize North Korea and Iran  he may be helping to nuclearize Saudi Arabia  This is abominable policy tainted by a gargantuan conflict of interest involving Kushner Kushner s family real estate business had been teetering because of a disastrously overpriced acquisition he made of a particular Manhattan property called 666 Fifth Avenue  but last August a company called Brookfield Asset Management rescued the Kushners by taking a 99 year lease of the troubled property   and paying the whole sum of about  1 1 billion up front Alarm bells should go off  Brookfield also owns Westinghouse Electric  the nuclear services business trying to sell reactors to Saudi Arabia Saudi swamp  meet American swamp It may be conflicts like these  along with even murkier ones  that led American intelligence officials to refuse a top secret security clearance for Kushner  The Times reported Thursday that Trump overruled them to grant Kushner the clearance  Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world  shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes  For a behind the scenes look at Nick s gritty journalism  sign up for his newsletter  This nuclear reactor mess began around the time of Trump s election  when a group of retired U S  national security officials put together a plan to enrich themselves by selling nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia  The officials included Michael Flynn  Trump s national security adviser  and they initially developed a  plan for 40 nuclear power plants  in Saudi Arabia  according to a report from the House Oversight and Reform Committee  The plan is now to start with just a couple of plants As recently as Feb  12  Trump met in the White House with backers of the project and was supportive  Reuters reported These are civilian nuclear power plants  and Saudi Arabia claims it wants them for electricity  But the Saudis insist on producing their own nuclear fuel  rather than buying it more cheaply abroad  Producing fuel is a standard way for rogue countries to divert fuel for secret nuclear weapons programs  and the Saudi resistance to safeguards against proliferation bolsters suspicions that the real goal is warheads Trump may be vigilant  destructively so  about Iran s nuclear plants  but in the Saudi case his response seems to be  There s money to be made  When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised objections to the transfer last year  Axios reported   Trump and his advisers told Netanyahu that  if the U S  does not sell the Saudis nuclear reactors  other countries like Russia or France will  Trump seems to believe that the Saudis have us over a barrel  If we don t help them with nuclear technology  someone else will  That misunderstands the U S  Saudi relationship  The Saudis depend on us for their security  and the blunt truth is that we hold all the cards in this relationship  not them Why on earth would America put Prince Mohammed on a path to acquiring nuclear weapons  He is already arguably the most destabilizing leader in an unstable region  for he has invaded Yemen  kidnapped Lebanon s prime minister  started a feud with Qatar  and  according to American intelligence officials  ordered the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi The prince has also imprisoned and brutally tortured women s rights activists  including one who I m hoping will win the Nobel Peace Prize  Loujain al Hathloul  As Representative Brad Sherman  a California Democrat  has noted   A country that can t be trusted with a bone saw shouldn t be trusted with nuclear weapons  The White House won t clarify whether Kushner discussed the nuclear issue when he met Prince Mohammed a few days ago  but Senator Jeff Merkley  an Oregon Democrat  told me   I d be surprised if it didn t come up   Along with Senators Ed Markey  a Massachusetts Democrat  and Rand Paul  a Kentucky Republican  Merkley has introduced a resolution to oppose the transfer of nuclear technology that would allow Saudi Arabia to create nuclear weapons There s another element of Trump s Saudi policy that is simply repulsive  the fawning courtship of a foreign prince who has created in Yemen the world s worst humanitarian crisis  murdered a journalist and tortured women s rights activists  The White House genuflections are such that Prince Mohammed had a point when  according to The Intercept  he bragged that he had Kushner in his  pocket  No one knows whether Prince Mohammed will manage to succeed his father and become the next king  for there is opposition and the Saudi economic transformation he boasts of is running into difficulties  Trump and Kushner seem to be irresponsibly trying to boost the prince s prospects  increasing the risk that an unstable hothead will mismanage the kingdom for the next 50 years  Perhaps with nuclear weapons Read More From

The globe s nuclear safety net is fraying badly  Dangers of nuclear confrontations are growing not only in Europe  with decisions by the presidents of both nuclear superpowers  Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin  to withdraw from a treaty banning intermediate range missiles  they are suddenly rising  too  in Asia  where India and Pakistan   both nuclear powers   have carried out conventional airstrikes across the Kashmir divide  Elsewhere in Asia  negotiations between Mr  Trump and North Korea s leader  Kim Jong un  to begin a denuclearization process have abruptly ended  The thickest  weight bearing strands of this safety net are treaties that have been cast aside without being replaced  With diplomacy sidelined  policymakers are left with nuclear threats to deter competitors  But deterrence rests on the underlying possibility of the use of nuclear weapons  otherwise  they would cease to deter  This can lead to tragic miscalculations  Treaties  by contrast  muffle and reduce threats  So  strengthening  deterrence without treaties and diplomacy is dangerous  it s a recipe for threatening your way into tight corners  as India and Pakistan have again shown  Hope to find an alternative to deterrence springs eternal  Some strategies seek escape through abolition of nuclear arms or the missiles that could deliver them  Others aim for victory rather than deterrence  by putting a protective missile defense shield in space  Those brands of escapism invite failure and heighten nuclear dangers  while the combination of deterrence and diplomacy has a proven record  One of the great ironies of the Cold War is that the acceptance of mutual vulnerability backstopped three decades of nuclear arms control and  eventually  deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the United States But now  killing treaties has become another form of escapism  After the Sept  11 attacks  the George W  Bush administration announced America s withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed between the two superpowers in 1972  Mr  Putin s response was to walk away from a 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that prohibited land based missiles from carrying multiple warheads  or MIRVs  Eliminating these missiles was a long sought goal of arms control  Now Russia is deploying MIRVed missiles in the worst possible way   with easily targeted  slow to use liquid fueled missiles based in silos   conditions that could provoke a launching at the first suspicion of an attack  even if unverified  for fear that they would be destroyed In August  Moscow and Washington seem set to leave the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987   the treaty that broke the back of the Cold War nuclear arms race  Mr  Trump has announced America s withdrawal without seeking to negotiate remedies to Russian violations  In his view  nothing less than destroying the offending Russian missiles would do  But now  Mr  Putin is free to deploy more of them Next up is  New Start   the sole surviving Russian American treaty that limits longer range missiles  It could be extended for another five years  but Mr  Trump and his national security adviser  John Bolton  have neither the diplomatic skills nor apparently an interest in extending its terms or negotiating better ones  On top of this  Mr  Trump and Mr  Bolton have championed new missile defense plans to protect every American city from any missiles from any origin The problem with such plans is that ground based missile defense interceptors remain woefully unable to do this   they don t have enough time to catch up to their targets  The only theoretical hope to protect American cities lies in space based interceptors  But that pursuit  like President Reagan s Strategic Defense Initiative  is most likely to again fail for technical  financial and political reasons  If the United States deploys interceptors in space  Russia and China will probably pursue countermeasures in the form of space mines that could trail American space based interceptors  at a small fraction of the cost  In other words  the hair trigger of terrestrial nuclear warfare would simply be duplicated in space How did we manage to survive the seven harrowing decades since Hiroshima and Nagasaki without the battlefield use of nuclear weapons  Deterrence alone didn t produce this result  the combination of deterrence and diplomacy did  This safety net was the greatest unacknowledged achievement during the Cold War  It now has very little load bearing capacity left The champions of jettisoning treaties have no sensible strategy or diplomatic road map to replace the nuclear safety net they are cutting  They rely on muscle flexing  dictation and unilateralism  which are mere postures  not strategy  This will not end well  Russia and China have the means to counter an America that seeks to escape deterrence and denigrate diplomacy  Nuclear dangers will rise as a result When the executive branch loses its moorings  it s up to Congress to steady the ship of state  Avoiding a new arms race will be difficult but not impossible  Mr  Putin knows he would lose it because America has superior technology and Russia s economy is in bad shape  China s strategy has been to avoid overspending on nuclear weapons while pursuing other means of negating American power  including with space and cyber warfare  Building up American nuclear capacity is not an effective counter to either of those Instead  Congress could choose to reduce nuclear excess through the power of the purse  Ordinarily  the job of orchestrating restraint is best left to the executive branch  and besides  Congress doesn t do nuance very well  But temporizing actions are probably the most we can do until there is a change in government  and stabilizing matters over the next two years will be hard to do  Still  a new arms race isn t foreordained   yet   and with enough common sense  we can avoid one The more Mr  Trump flails  Mr  Bolton tears down and Mr  Putin sows fear and broadcasts threats  the more Capitol Hill is obliged to step up  The nuclear safety net that previous generations bequeathed to us is in desperate need of repair  For the time being  there s nowhere else to turn but Congress Michael Krepon is a co founder of the Stimson Center  a Washington based

WASHINGTON   A powerful Democratic House committee chairman investigating possible abuses of the government s security clearance process stepped up demands on Friday to see key documents and interview potential witnesses from the White House in light of a new report that President Trump personally intervened to grant his son in law a top secret clearance despite legal and national security concerns The chairman  Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  who leads the House Oversight and Reform Committee  accused the White House in a new letter of stonewalling his requests for information and implied that if it did not comply voluntarily  he would issue a subpoena to compel its cooperation He said the report  published by The New York Times  added new concerns that Mr  Trump was lying to the public about his role in the clearance process to existing and broader questions about irregularities surrounding who should have access to sensitive government secrets  If true  these new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr  Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation s most sensitive secrets   Mr  Cummings wrote in a letter to Pat Cipollone  the White House counsel  The letter went on to ask about  why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation  why General Kelly and Mr  McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions  and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this Committee  The report in The New York Times said that Mr  Trump s intervention so concerned senior administration officials that John F  Kelly  then the White House chief of staff  documented the action in a contemporaneous internal memo that said he had been  ordered  to grant Mr  Kushner a top secret clearance The Times also reported that Donald F  McGahn II  then the White House counsel  wrote a memo of his own documenting concerns raised by the C I A  and other officials about Mr  Kushner  Mr  McGahn  the memo noted  had recommended against giving him such broad access to the government s secrets Mr  Trump told The Times in January in an Oval Office interview that he had no role in Mr  Kushner s clearance Mr  Cummings has been pursuing reported irregularities by the White House and the Trump transition team since 2017  when Republicans were in control of the House  But he started a broad inquiry of his own last month after taking control of the oversight panel  Congress s most muscular investigative body  which he said he hoped would shine light on any national security risks that may exist He has specifically requested information on the clearances of nine current and former administration officials  including Mr  Kushner  Among those whose clearances he intends to scrutinize are Mr  Trump s current and former national security advisers  John R  Bolton and Michael T  Flynn  his onetime staff secretary  Rob Porter  a former senior director on the National Security Council  Robin Townley  a former deputy national security adviser  K  T  McFarland  as well as Sebastian Gorka  a former deputy assistant to the president Mr  Cummings has also asked for documents related to a review of the security clearance process that Mr  Kelly conducted in 2018 that concluded there were serious flaws in the system meant to vet high level officials  And Mr  Cummings wants to talk to  all personnel in the White House Personnel Security Office  The White House  he said on Friday  has thus far not complied In a sign that House Democrats would seek to further elevate the issue in their oversight agenda  Representative Adam B  Schiff of California  the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  said on Thursday that his panel  responsible for overseeing American intelligence agencies  would work with Mr  Cummings  Mr  Schiff called Mr  Trump s actions the  latest indicator of the president s utter disregard for our national security and for the men and women who sacrifice so much every day to keep us safe

BRUSSELS   As diplomatic spats go  it was a spring shower in a teapot  not even a minor tempest  But European feelings were badly bruised last year when the Trump administration downgraded the diplomatic status of the European Union s delegation to the United States without making a formal announcement or even informing the bloc about the change The permanent reversal of that decision was announced on Monday  with the ambassador of the European Union to the United States now again considered to be equivalent to an ambassador from a country  not just to an envoy from an international organization The announcement was made with some fanfare by the American ambassador to the European Union  Gordon Sondland  whom European diplomats credit with pushing hard for the fix  In a statement  Mr  Sondland called the bloc  a uniquely important organization  and one of America s most valuable partners in ensuring global security and prosperity  President Trump has called the European Union  a foe  in economic competition with the United States  but Mr  Sondland said that  Europe s security and success are inextricably linked to that of the United States  and this level of engagement and cooperation should be recognized appropriately in all settings  It is a change in tone for Mr  Sondland  a hotelier and businessman from Washington State who has regularly criticized the European Union as being  out of touch   He has faulted the bloc for being obsessed with regulation and for not being eager enough to meet Mr  Trump s demands to lower the roughly  150 billion trade deficit in goods it has with the United States  though that figure ignores the American advantage in services  In an interview with Politico Europe in December  Mr  Sondland said of Brussels   There is clearly an effort to maintain the status quo  and we now have to recognize that the relationship and all of the good will that has been built up since the Marshall Plan doesn t seem to count when it comes to getting a little consideration  So we are going to have to do what we have to do  A month ago  Mr  Sondland said that the European Commission was  like a factory churning out regulation after regulation after regulation  Even regulating things that don t exist today on the theory that someday  someone is going to get hurt somewhere   He also warned that Washington would escalate a trade dispute    forced to do a tit for tat    if Brussels did not heed the Trump administration s demands Privately  Mr  Sondland is even more caustic  and European officials tend to raise their eyes when asked about his negotiating style  which they consider to be brash  But some of those same officials were also quick to praise Mr  Sondland for going to bat for the bloc in the protocol battle and for understanding that the change had been needlessly offensive The downgrade became evident at the December funeral of President George Bush  when the name of the European Union ambassador  David O Sullivan  was not called in the expected order  The names of diplomats who had gathered in Washington to pay their respects were spoken  as is custom  from the longest serving ambassador to the newest  but Mr  O Sullivan was called last The demotion that was apparent at the funeral came a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a blistering speech in Brussels  in which he questioned the value of multinational organizations like the United Nations and the European Union  Mr  Pompeo asked whether the European Union was  ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats  There followed quiet complaints through diplomatic channels from the European Union  and in January the downgrade was described as having been  temporarily reversed   The announcement of the permanent reinstatement came on Monday in a statement to welcome Mr  O Sullivan s replacement  Stavros Lambrinidis Christian Ehler  chairman of the European Parliament s delegation for relations with the United States  said that he welcomed the move but  would like to highlight that the downgrading was a mistake in the first place that has now been corrected  Mr  Ehler said that he hoped that the upgrade  will restore trust and will ensure the continuation of a close and constructive trans Atlantic cooperation  Marietje Schaake  a Dutch member of the European Parliament who is in Washington with a delegation to discuss the trans Atlantic relationship  said the downgrading  should never have happened  and we don t know why it happened   She added   it may have been just a mistake  Ms  Schaake said she was pleased that the rhetoric had become less insulting   The administration is often very direct and sometimes outright provocative   she said   But in

A dual citizen of Saudi Arabia and the United States had been imprisoned in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh for about a week when he heard a knock on his door Guards dragged Walid Fitaihi  a Harvard trained physician  to another room  according to a friend who took down the prisoner s detailed account of his treatment  Dr  Fitaihi told the friend he was slapped  blindfolded  stripped to his underwear and bound to a chair  He was shocked with electricity in what appears to have been a single session of torture that lasted about an hour His tormentors whipped his back so severely that he could not sleep on it for days  his friend said  speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals  The doctor had described the physical abuse  in general terms  to his relatives as well  a person close to them said Detained in November 2017 in what was billed as a crackdown on corruption  Dr  Fitaihi  54  remains imprisoned without any public charges or trial  About 200 prominent Saudis were detained with him  and he is one of dozens who remain in prison Friends and families of others detained have also described episodes of torture  At least 17 detainees were hospitalized soon after the crackdown for injuries sustained while in custody  according to a doctor at the hospital and an American official monitoring the crackdown ImageJared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and

other signs of abuse on his body  according to a person who saw it  Women s rights advocates jailed in Saudi Arabia have said they were also tortured  including by electrical shocks  according to their relatives and rights groups But Dr  Fitaihi s American citizenship means that his mistreatment  which has not been previously reported  may now pose a special threat to Saudi relations with Washington  The Trump administration is already struggling to quell a bipartisan backlash against the kingdom over the killing last fall of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi  a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist who was executed and dismembered by a team of Saudi agents in the kingdom s consulate in Istanbul This past week  Jared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and Middle East adviser  met for the first time since the killing with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  the de facto ruler of the kingdom  American intelligence agencies have concluded that the crown prince ordered Mr  Khashoggi s killing Mr  Kushner met with  Prince Mohammed to promote a potential resolution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict in which the prince and his country may play a big role The Trump administration  meanwhile  has defied a congressional deadline to report about who was responsible for the killing  Instead  President Trump has equivocated about whether Prince Mohammed might have authorized it  even as he has extolled the value of Saudi Arabian oil sales and defense contracts American friends of Dr  Fitaihi are stepping up a campaign to press Washington to take up his case  They say the Trump administration s public silence about his incarceration is at odds with Mr  Trump s repeated boasts about his successful efforts to extricate American citizens held abroad Mr  Trump

Washington said the kingdom has signed the convention against torture and prohibits its use  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia takes any and all allegations of ill treatment of defendants awaiting trial or prisoners serving their sentences very seriously   the spokesman said Dr  Fitaihi got his American citizenship while studying and practicing medicine in the United States  where one of his sons lives  After returning to Saudi Arabia  he founded a private hospital in Jeddah and became well known as a motivational speaker The reason for his detention is unclear  But the friend who relayed Dr  Fitaihi s account of his treatment said that he was questioned primarily about a relative by marriage who had also been detained  Adel Fakeih  a former top aide to the crown prince  Dr  Fitaihi believed his interrogators were seeking evidence against Mr  Fakeih  the friend said Announcing the end of its corruption purge at the end of January  Saudi Arabia said that 64 people were still being held for

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration issued a new round of visa restrictions and economic sanctions on Friday against the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela  who has given little indication that he will cede control despite a prediction by a top American envoy that his  dictatorship  would come to an end   quickly and peacefully  The envoy  Elliott Abrams  also noted the possibility of American military intervention  as requested by Juan Guaidó  the Venezuelan opposition leader  But he described it as a distant line of action behind other moves meant to ratchet up diplomatic and economic pressure against Mr  Maduro  We continue to say  and we always will  that all options are on the table   Mr  Abrams told reporters at the State Department   But I think that anyone who actually looks at American policy in Venezuela could not reach that conclusion  Vice President Mike Pence  who has visited the region five times  largely to put pressure on Mr  Maduro  said this week that he personally reassured Mr  Guaidó that military intervention was on the table  But  he said  that decision was ultimately up to President Trump The Trump administration this week escalated its campaign to pressure Mr  Maduro to step down  even as adversarial governments  including Russia  have become involved in the conflict In January  with White House support  Mr  Guaidó declared himself Venezuela s interim president after accusations of electoral fraud and corruption by the Maduro government that have sent the country s economy into hyperinflation and poverty Mr  Abrams swatted away a suggestion made by Sergey V  Lavrov  the Russian foreign minister  that the United States was pondering immediate military intervention Instead  Mr  Abrams said  the Trump administration is focused on relatively modest sanctions that were announced on Friday and earlier this week  including those against at least 10 Venezuelan government officials and members of Mr  Maduro s inner circle  accusing them of abuse of power and of blocking aid to the country Mr  Abrams also announced visa restrictions for  dozens  of Mr  Maduro s associates  some of whom he said may be in the United States  He said he was prohibited from naming the Venezuelan officials and their family members whose visas were revoked but cited a  mix  of people both inside and outside the United States In recent days  White House officials have tried to maintain pressure on Mr  Maduro  who emerged relatively unfazed after a largely failed American backed effort to send convoys of humanitarian aid into Venezuela last weekend  Efforts to persuade its soldiers to defect degenerated into clashes and mayhem between anti Maduro protesters and Venezuelan security forces along the borders with Colombia and Brazil Only a smattering of aid got through  and it did little if anything to loosen Mr  Maduro s control Mr  Pence met on Monday with Mr  Guaidó in Colombia  On Friday  he declared that  Nicolás Maduro must go  in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington  Nicolás Maduro is a dictator with no claim to power   Mr  Pence said Since violating a travel ban and slipping across the Venezuelan border into Colombia last week  Mr  Guaidó has traveled through Latin America in an effort to build an international coalition against Mr  Maduro  He has vowed to return to Venezuela in the coming days  though he has said he cannot be sure of what will happen once he arrives  Of course  it is a risk   Mr  Guaidó said in a news conference in Brazil on Thursday   even life threatening  For his part  Mr  Maduro has called Mr  Guaidó a coup plotter and a Trump administration lackey  and has described the humanitarian aid effort as a pretext for an American invasion directed from Colombia  He broke diplomatic relations with Colombia on Saturday in retaliation Mr  Abrams warned that any action taken against Mr  Guaidó would be met with an outcry on behalf of the Venezuelan people and the international community As Mr  Trump and his advisers mull options  the Russian government has aligned with Mr  Maduro  sending aid and expressing support for the Venezuelan president s government  Russia will continue to assist the Venezuelan authorities in resolving social and economic problems  including through the provision of legitimate humanitarian aid   Mr  Lavrov said at a news conference on Friday with Delcy Rodríguez  the Venezuelan vice president  Russia has pledged to provide food and medicine to the Maduro government  a move that Mr  Abrams questioned as a possible  political weapon    one that he said could be intended to help Mr  Maduro s supporters and not Venezuelans who oppose his government Mr  Lavrov also said that military intervention on behalf of the United States would be  in defiance of all international norms   His comments were quickly brushed aside by John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump s national security adviser  who has in recent days taken to Twitter to lash out at Mr  Maduro s government  Talks between Russia and Maduro s cronies are only useful if they are discussing retirement beaches for Maduro   Mr  Bolton said on Friday   Change is the only way forward in Venezuela  
Good Monday   Want this by email  Sign up here  An expected China trade deal lacks teethThe Trump administration is nearing a trade deal with China that would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific  Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT write What America could get   The deal would  require Beijing to make big purchases of American agricultural and energy goods and to lower some barriers that prevent American companies from operating in China    The potential agreement  would expand markets for American financial services firms and farmers  in part by requiring that China buy large amounts of energy and farm goods  like liquid natural gas and soybeans     The Trump administration has also been pushing China to accept an enforcement mechanism that would enable the United States to quickly reinstate tariffs if Beijing fails to live up to specific promises  And China    In return  the United States would most likely drop its tariffs on at least  200 billion of the  250 billion worth of Chinese imports currently subject to American levies    Beijing is also  pushing for the elimination of all of the Trump tariffs  a person with knowledge of the negotiations said   But  early details indicate it would do little to substantively change the way China has long done business and would not force Beijing to curtail cyber theft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for American companies     The language aimed at China s discrimination against foreign companies  like its antimonopoly law or standard setting processes  is probably too vague to be enforceable   according to an unidentified source    The pact also doesn t alter China s tight restrictions on data   and  many of the big purchases that Beijing is promising would occur over a number of years  which could give China further leverage  More  How Apple prevailed in the trade war  And why President Trump s battle hasn t helped narrow the trade deficit Huawei plans to sue the U S The Chinese telecom giant plans to take the U S  government to court for banning federal agencies from using its products  Ray Zhong and Paul Mozur of the NYT report    The move could be aimed at forcing the United States government to more publicly make its case against the Chinese equipment maker     It is part of a broad push by Huawei to defend itself against a campaign led by the United States to undermine the company  which Washington sees as a security threat    Huawei s lawsuit will challenge a section in a defense spending law that blocks federal agencies from using its equipment  The company will argue that the provision amounts to a  bill of attainder   or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial   Huawei s C F O

ReutersTrump s 2020 campaign shocks with 5G planOn Friday  the Trump re election campaign   including its manager  Brad Parscale  and an adviser  Newt Gingrich   called for a nationwide  wholesale  5G network  that would allow the government to control the spectrum and find a way to share it with carriers  A 5G wholesale market would drive down costs and provide access to millions of Americans who are currently underserved   Kayleigh McEnany  the campaign s national press secretary  told Politico The news was met with surprise as it s at odds with current White House policy  Axios says it was unable to find telecom policy advisers inside the Trump administration  who knew in advance from the Trump campaign that it would make this announcement   The telecoms industry has long argued against nationalized 5G networks The campaign later walked back its comments   The White House sets the policy on 5G and all issues   Ms  McEnany said in a statement   The campaign fully supports the president s priorities and his policy agenda  But it raises concerns about what happens next  The administration previously contemplated taking a role in 5G  as detailed in a National Security Council

John Hickenlooper  the former governor of Colorado  faces a basic challenge in the crowded Democratic presidential primary  He is a centrist in a party that s moving to the left  While he has shifted in some areas  he will still be running to the right of the most prominent candidates  with more of an emphasis on pragmatism than idealism  Read about Mr  Hickenlooper s entrance into the race here  Here are some of the issues he s likely to discuss Gun controlMr  Hickenlooper spent eight years as mayor of Denver  less than 10 miles from the sites of two of the nation s worst mass shootings  Columbine High School and Aurora  Colo  He was governor at the time of the Aurora theater shooting  in which 12 people were killed and more than 50 were injured  In the aftermath  Colorado legislators passed universal background checks and a ban on high capacity magazines  Mr  Hickenlooper wants to enact similar policies  along with a higher minimum age to buy certain firearms  at the federal level  Gun violence is the real national emergency plaguing our nation   he tweeted after the shooting last month in Aurora  Ill Notably  Mr  Hickenlooper did not always support gun control  Shortly after the theater shooting in 2012  he told ABC that the gunman was  diabolical  and would have found another way to carry out his massacre if guns had not been available  a common argument from gun control opponents  But by the time the background check and magazine bills reached his desk  he had changed his mind and signed them  He continues to promote the restrictions as a selling point in his record Health careMr  Hickenlooper supports universal health care in principle but has refused to get behind specific proposals like  Medicare for all   Speaking in New Hampshire last month  he said that there were  many different ways to cut the pie and work on the issue  and that intraparty arguments over the specifics were counterproductive He did  however  explicitly reject the idea of eliminating private insurance companies  as promoted by Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris During his governorship  Mr  Hickenlooper and Colorado s divided Legislature expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act  a fact he highlighted as speculation about a possible presidential run increased The environmentAs governor  Mr  Hickenlooper   a former geologist   added Colorado to the U S  Climate Alliance  a group of states working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to counter the Trump administration s environmental policies  He also signed an executive order mandating  by 2025  a 26 percent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels  and emphasized the economic potential of renewable energy  He has called for a more aggressive response to climate change  and expressed tentative support for the Green New Deal But in contrast to many other Democrats  he has supported the controversial process of hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  and his policies as governor were generally friendly to the oil and gas industries  For instance  he opposed a ballot initiative in Colorado that would have limited where oil wells could be built   Voters rejected the measure in November  Free tradeMr  Hickenlooper supports trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans Pacific Partnership  a position that puts him at odds with both President Trump and some of his more liberal competitors in the Democratic primary  Last year  in the final months of his term as governor  he and John Kasich  then the Republican governor of Ohio  wrote a letter to the Trump administration opposing the tariffs and the adversarial tone of its efforts to renegotiate Nafta The letter emphasized the effects of those policies on rural and blue collar communities  many of which voted for Mr  Trump but have suffered economically as a result of his tariffs 
Calling it a  mere pretext  for sinister intent  Russia vetoed an American resolution in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday for new elections and unhindered distribution of humanitarian aid in Venezuela It was the latest clash in a Cold War style quarrel playing out amid the chaos unfolding in Venezuela  once Latin America s most prosperous country From the outset  there was little hope the American measure would surmount opposition from Russia  which proposed a rival resolution that was roundly rejected by the Security Council China  another permanent member of the council  also opposed the American resolution The Kremlin has aligned closely with President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela even as the United States and about 50 other countries  many of them in Latin America and Europe  have renounced relations with him They have accused Mr  Maduro s government of grossly mismanaging the country and driving the economy to the brink of collapse  causing a humanitarian catastrophe that has forced more than 3 4 million to flee These countries have thrown their support behind Juan Guaidó  the 35 year old leader of the opposition in Venezuela s National Assembly  who declared himself president last month  On Thursday he arrived in Brazil for talks with that country s president  Jair Bolsonaro  a harsh Maduro critic In remarks before the Security Council  Elliott Abrams  the Trump administration s special representative for Venezuela  referred to the  corrupt former Maduro regime   and urged a  peaceful transition to democracy   Regardless of the results of today s vote  this resolution shows that democracies around the world and especially in Latin America are mobilizing behind interim President Guaidó   Mr  Abrams said Nine countries in the 15 member Security Council voted for the American measure  enough for it to have passed had Russia and China not voted against it  Any  no  vote by a permanent member vetoes a resolution Though the American resolution said nothing about possible military intervention  President Trump has said that  all options are open   a sentiment that Mr  Abrams echoed in his remarks Russia and others have accused the United States of plotting to overthrow Mr  Maduro by force  a possibility that even harsh critics of the current regime strongly oppose  Hypocritical concerns about the humanitarian situation in the country is a mere pretext   said Vassily A  Nebenzia  Russia s ambassador to the United Nations  Washington is obstinately seeking to escalate tensions and to implement their scenario for an unconstitutional change of government   he said  He later referenced the role of the United States in the overthrow of Muammar el Qaddafi in Libya in 2011 as an example of why the stated humanitarian goals of American officials cannot be trusted  If the United States were genuinely keen to help the people of Venezuela   Mr  Nebenzia said   then they would operate through official channels  through any of the U N  accredited agencies in that country  But that s not their goal  Mr  Maduro s popularity in Venezuela has plummeted as basic services and institutions buckle under the strain of economic collapse  Food  medicine and fuel have grown increasingly scarce Mr  Maduro and his supporters have blamed the economic crisis on sanctions imposed by the United States  In January  the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Venezuela s state owned oil company and froze  7 billion in assets  cutting off the country s most important source of revenue In his remarks on Thursday  Venezuela s ambassador  Samuel Moncada Acosta  described Venezuela as  completely at peace   but denounced what he described as a  colonial intervention  by the United States 
MOSCOW   President Vladimir V  Putin on Monday formally suspended Russia s observance of a key nuclear arms treaty that the United States withdrew from last month  setting the stage for the return of a long banned class of weapons The Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  signed in 1987 in the waning years of the Cold War  had prohibited land based missiles with relatively short ranges of 300 to 3 400 miles  Because of their quick flight times  such missiles were seen as a hair trigger for nuclear war The United States has for years accused Russia of violating the treaty by understating the range of one of its truck launched missiles  The Obama administration pressed the issue during the crisis over Russia s invasion of Ukraine  and President Trump cited it when he announced the United States  decision to withdraw Mr  Trump also pointed out that China  which was never a party to the treaty  has been free to amass its own arsenal of the missiles Mr  Putin said last month that Russia would respond  symmetrically  to the American move  a decision formalized Monday with a decree posted on the Kremlin s website The decree  said Russia would suspend its observance because of  the need to take urgent measures in connection with the United States  violations of its obligations  under the treaty In announcing the decision in February  Mr  Putin had said Russia would design and build weapons previously banned under the treaty   something the United States says Russia is already doing   but would not deploy them unless America did so first Both Russia and the United States have sea  and air launched missiles that fly within the ranges covered by the treaty  Russia s defense minister has said the country will design and test a land based launcher for its maritime cruise missile  an analogue to the American Tomahawk that Moscow calls the Kalibr  and a new short range ballistic missile Russia s accusation that the United States had violated the treaty was a possible reference to America s decision to suspend observance of it  or to earlier accusations that Russia had leveled against the United States about its military capabilities Russia had maintained that American armed drones fly within ranges banned by the treaty  though this class of weapon did not exist in the 1980s  and that United States missile defense sites in Europe use launchers capable of firing short  and intermediate range missiles 
WASHINGTON   A federal judge on Monday rejected a request that he speed up consideration of a lawsuit filed on behalf of Hoda Muthana  an American born woman who joined the Islamic State group in 2014 and is now stranded in a refugee camp in Syria with her 18 month old son  the child of a slain ISIS fighter But the judge  Reggie Walton of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia  also suggested that he took a positive view of legal arguments that Ms  Muthana may be an American citizen  contrary to the government s declaration that she is not one The fate of Ms  Muthana  whose family lives in Alabama  has raised novel legal issues and become a political flash point since she surrendered to coalition forces fighting ISIS and said last month that she wanted to come home  In response  the Trump administration said she was not a citizen and would not be allowed back The judge s ruling that there are insufficient grounds to expedite the litigation means that her case is unlikely to be resolved until late spring or summer  But his comments also provide a reason to believe that she may ultimately prevail  Charlie Swift  a lawyer hired by her father  said after the hearing that he was  encouraged  by Judge Walton s views and hoped it was  foreshadowing  of the outcome In 2015  Ms  Muthana withdrew from college and used her tuition reimbursement to fund her travel to Syria  Once there  she touted ISIS s ideology on social media  including calling on Muslims in America to carry out terrorist attacks  But she now says she is sorry and wants to come home  Mr  Swift said she had wanted to leave earlier but feared being executed if she tried to leave The State Department canceled her passport in 2016   under the Obama administration   and the Justice Department is taking the position that she does not qualify to be an American citizen under an exception to birthright citizenship in the Constitution for children of foreign diplomats Ms  Muthana s father was a diplomat from Yemen  but was discharged from that post shortly before she was born  The United States government only learned of that change after she was born  raising the question of whether his diplomatic status expired before or after her birth Her father has filed a lawsuit asking for declarations that she remains a citizen and that he may send her money without violating the law  He is also asking Judge Walton to order the government to take steps to take custody of her and his grandson from the Kurdish led Syrian Democratic Forces now holding them and to bring them to American soil On Monday  Mr  Swift argued that Ms  Muthana and her son are in danger  including because other ISIS members now see her as a heretic  He also said Mr  Trump s intention to withdraw troops from Syria means the window of opportunity for the American government to get her out may be closing  And he emphasized that she would likely be prosecuted if she returns Mr  Swift also said the Justice Department s argument that a discharged former diplomat keeps his status until the United States government is notified of the change would produce absurd results  like letting former diplomats remain immune from prosecution for crimes committed during any lag period Foreign adversaries could exploit such a rule  he said  by quietly discharging diplomats while instructing them to commit espionage or sabotage  If such operatives were caught  they would have legal impunity while permitting those foreign governments to deny any responsibility Judge Walton said he had decided to handle the case on the normal timetable because the arguments that Ms  Muthana faced irreparable harm from delay were too speculative  But he also said Mr  Swift had offered good arguments for why it  didn t make sense  to interpret diplomatic status as lingering after a discharge if the American government does not receive notice right away Last month  Senator Doug Jones  Democrat of Alabama  said Ms  Muthana should return to the United States and be prosecuted  Americans who joined ISIS   or were arrested as they tried to travel to Syria   have been routinely charged and convicted of providing material support to terrorism But President Trump said he had directed the government not to allow her back  and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement declaring that she  is not a U S  citizen and will not be admitted into the United States   In an interview with Gray News broadcast Sunday night  Mr  Pompeo reiterated that Ms  Muthana is not welcome back  She has no right to come back to the United States of America   he said   She s not a U S  citizen  She has no claim for U S  citizenship  That s what we ll be telling the court because that s the truth  
To the Editor In  Climate Panel Could Question Scope of Threat   front page  Feb  21   you report that the Trump administration intends to appoint a committee to investigate whether climate change  affects national security   The executive order creating the committee  casts doubt  on multiple government studies of climate change  noting that accepted climate science has not  undergone a rigorous independent and adversarial peer review  The government climate studies in question and dozens of similar studies have already been subjected to rigorous peer review  Perhaps the ultimate aim is to reset the standard for accepted scientific knowledge to that which is proved beyond the shadow of a doubt  with climate change deniers self empowered to act as the judge of whether that standard has been met For decades Republicans have treated science as an arena of partisan bickering rather than as a search for truth  The suggested change in the accepted system of peer review   adding the insidious requirement that it be  adversarial    would bring us one step closer to that future Stephen BurrowTeaneck  N J 
Michael R  White  the Navy veteran imprisoned in Iran since July  was beaten after his arrest  has no money to hire a lawyer and still does not know what charges   if any   have been filed against him  his mother said Monday Joanne White also said that her son  a former cancer patient  had been taken to a court at least twice and that his health was deteriorating A family spokesman  Jonathan Franks  said a GoFundMe page had been started to raise funds for Mr  White s legal representation in Iran Ms  White learned of her son s travails after diplomats from the Swiss Embassy in Tehran visited him on Feb  6 at the prison where he has been held  in the northeast city of Mashhad  The Swiss Embassy represents American interests in Iran It was the first time the Swiss had been able to see Mr  White since he was seized in Mashhad last July and taken to Vakilabad Prison  after having visited a person his family has described as an Iranian girlfriend  He has still not been able to communicate directly with his family Mr  White  47  of Imperial Beach  Calif   served in the Navy for 13 years  He is the first American to be incarcerated in Iran since President Trump took office in 2017  adding a complication to what already was a severely strained relationship between the United States and Iran He is one of at least four Americans known to be held in Iran  where the government has regarded the United States as its top enemy since the Islamic revolution that overthrew the shah 40 years ago  Over the past few weeks   Ms  White said   I ve learned that Mike was badly beaten when he was arrested and that he has been taken to court at least twice for proceedings in Farsi that he couldn t understand  My son is not well  His health is deteriorating  and I want him back so I can get him the care he badly needs  Alireza Miryousefi  a spokesman for Iran s United Nations Mission  confirmed in an email that the Swiss had met with Mr  White and that another meeting was planned in  coming days  Mr  Miryousefi also said that Iran s judiciary had provided medicine needed by Mr  White  despite increased prices caused by American sanctions  We can assuredly say that Mr  White is being treated humanely and in the best possible conditions given the criminal complaint against him   he said   We also hope  along with his family  that his case is speedily adjudicated by the judiciary that is in charge  Iranian officials have previously said Mr  White s imprisonment in Mashhad was a response to a complaint by an  individual plaintiff   whom they have not identified  They have also said he was under investigation for unspecified security charges Ms  White said she was compelled to resort to GoFundMe because her son had no money   Like most military families  it s hard for us to ask for help like this  but I am a widow on a fixed income   she said Mr  Franks  the family spokesman  said money raised would be transmitted to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran through the State Department for use in hiring an Iranian lawyer He said some of the funds might be disbursed  to purchase extra food for Mike and other items  and also to make it possible for him to contact the outside world if and when the restrictions on him doing so are removed  While the Trump administration has successfully extricated Americans held in North Korea  Egypt and   most recently   Yemen  there has been no obvious progress in securing the release of Americans known to be held in Iran They include Siamak and Baquer Namazi  an Iranian American father and son  and Xiyue Wang  a Chinese American graduate student at Princeton University  Another American  Robert Levinson  has been missing in Iran since 2007 Relatives of those Americans and of a Lebanese permanent resident of the United States  Nizar Zakka  who has been held in Iran since 2015  are scheduled to testify on Thursday before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in Washington 
On Wednesday  the Supreme Court once again took on a question that has long confounded it  What qualifies as an impermissible establishment of religion under the Constitution The court has over the years sent mixed signals about when the government may be playing favorites with a particular faith  For instance  in its ruling last year upholding President Trump s executive order imposing an entry ban on people from several Muslim majority countries  the Supreme Court insisted  in a 5 to 4 vote  that the restrictions were  facially neutral toward religion   ignoring the president s long history of antipathy toward Islam and its adherents  And weeks earlier  the justices ruled  in a narrow decision  for a Christian baker who had claimed mistreatment by Colorado s civil rights commission  which penalized him for denying service to a gay couple This week s hearing  in American Legion v  American Humanist Association  involved a 40 foot cross in Bladensburg  Md   that was erected 93 years ago to honor fallen World War I soldiers  The question before the court  Is Maryland in violation of the First Amendment because the memorial is on public property and maintained with public funds Over the years  the justices have tried to come up with rules to assess all kinds of religious emblems and practices carrying the government s imprimatur   sectarian prayers in legislative sessions  war memorials  Ten Commandments and Christmas displays  and mottos on seals or currency Lower court judges are confused about how to apply the Supreme Court s dictates in this area of the law  so more clarity from the high court   if not a definitive  bright line rule   is in order Alas  such clarity doesn t seem to be on the horizon  After Wednesday s hearing  the court seems poised to allow the cross   which otherwise bears no religious inscriptions   to stay  But the justices don t appear to be any closer to consensus on this issue than they ve ever been  I mean  it is the foremost symbol of Christianity  isn t it   Justice Elena Kagan asked at Wednesday s session   It invokes the central theological claim of Christianity  that Jesus Christ  the son of God  died on the cross for humanity s sins and that he rose from the dead  This is why Christians use crosses as a way to memorialize the dead  Justice Stephen Breyer  who in the past has wrestled with the Constitution s religion clauses  pondered whether  history counts  when assessing a monument s legality  Maybe older displays  erected when the nation wasn t nearly as religiously diverse  should be allowed  he suggested   We re a different country   Justice Breyer said   We are a different country now  and there are 50 more different religions  The Trump administration  which isn t a party in the case  has nonetheless weighed in  participating in oral arguments in support of the Maryland monument and other memorial crosses on federal property that could be similarly challenged  In the administration s view  the Maryland cross is secular in context and not an endorsement of any particular faith  and only displays that  coerce  religious belief or adherence ought to be considered unconstitutional  Taking offense at a passive display is not enough Arlington National Cemetery provides a good example of the kind of nondiscrimination the government should be aiming for  Federal rules allow for a wide array of religious and nonreligious symbols on headstones   That s the way this sort of thing is being handled today in a pluralistic society in which ordinary people   are not at each other s throats about religious divisions   Justice Samuel Alito said of Arlington on Wednesday That s fair enough  But with its recent rulings  the Supreme Court has only muddied the separation between church and state by taking seriously religious objections to contraception  civil rights laws and the allocation of public funds  It is hard to fathom the justices being nearly as accommodating with a publicly funded monument to atheism or a Wiccan pentagram  And last month  the court couldn t even agree that a Muslim death row prisoner from Alabama deserved the same rights as Christians in his final moments However the justices resolve this the dispute  they would be wise to not sow more confusion in this area of the law and feed the perception that only certain religions and practices get a fair shake in public life RelatedMore on the Supreme Court and religious freedomSupreme Court Seems Ready to Allow Cross Honoring War DeadFeb  27  2019Opinion   The Editorial BoardIs Religious Freedom for Christians Only Feb  9  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram 
To the Editor Re  What s Green  What s the Deal    editorial  Feb  24  Your excellent editorial lays out the contrast between the promise of a well crafted Green New Deal and the folly of doing nothing to address the central environmental challenge of our time From President Trump and Mitch McConnell on down  Republican leaders are running out of places to hide from their abject failure to protect our people from the rising costs and mounting dangers of climate change First  they said it was all a hoax  As the seas kept rising  the storms kept raging and the wildfires burned out of control  they threw up their hands and whined   We re not scientists   Now they ve got a new talking point  Trying to fight climate change  they say  is socialism  Socialism Nonsense  Pooling the best of American innovation and ideas to confront growing problems and gathering threats plays to our strengths as a democracy  as we ve proved time and again through successful initiatives from Social Security to Medicare Some Republicans seem hellbent on putting polluter profits first  even when it means putting the rest of us at risk  It s time to stand up and say we ve had enough  It s time for assertive and comprehensive action to protect our children from climate catastrophe   while we ve still got time Rhea SuhNew YorkThe writer is president of the Natural Resources Defense Council To the Editor The Green New Deal should be concerning to anyone who actually cares about climate change and supports a serious and urgent solution to the problem  This resolution uses climate change as leverage to push a clear and divisive social welfare agenda  The result is an overly expensive and incomplete solution to the climate crisis  Your editorial acknowledges these possibilities but hangs its hat on the premise that any climate change proposal is good for the cause  Let s stick to celebrating climate change resolutions that at least make an effort at unifying the country around ambitious but workable solutions Jon NevittScarsdale  N Y  To the Editor As young people  we are often told to calm down  to be patient  We have our whole lives ahead of us to figure things out  But when young people look to the future  we see a dark cloud  We see wildfires ravaging the West  We hear of record flooding and ever more powerful storms in the South  We feel the frigid cold brought to us by changing weather patterns  and we are scared In my classes  I study the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the last 70 years  which tells us to brace ourselves for climate conditions our species has never seen  That terrifies me  What keeps me optimistic  though  is the fact that people are working to understand how climate change will affect society and the ecosystems we depend on  But that work means nothing if our government does not pay attention to these findings and act That is why I am writing to voice my support for the Green New Deal  Climate change is a large problem to tackle  but we have to start somewhere  and the Green New Deal does just that  Colleen B  SchmidtNew YorkTo the Editor Re  Dianne Feinstein Lectures Children Who Want Green New Deal  Portraying It as Untenable   nytimes com  Feb  22  In her meeting with schoolchildren  Senator Dianne Feinstein demonstrated how not to approach the Green New Deal  especially with an audience of enthusiastic  idealistic youngsters whose future is at stake While I totally agree that the Green New Deal is not viable as currently formulated  I also believe that   especially with regard to climate change   it is a goal to strive toward  But if we are to avoid a tear within the Democratic Party  and a tear between generations  we must embrace both the goal and the obstacles What Ms  Feinstein should have said was that she will work toward that goal  recognizing both how important it is and how it will be feasible only in more manageable steps Let us not quash the idealism that is needed to make such major changes  But let us also not forget a quote attributed to Voltaire that  the best is the enemy of the good  Zvi J  DoronPittsburghThe writer is a retired nuclear engineer and co author of a book about energy and climate policies To the Editor While the children of the Sunrise Movement  who are working to stop climate change  may not understand how the Senate functions  they do correctly understand that if the world keeps functioning under business as usual rules  their lives will be fraught with one climate catastrophe after the next And it is not just children in states with Democratic senators who know this  Middle and high school students in Kentucky were out in force all week  even camping overnight in front of Mitch McConnell s Senate office for the chance to make their case  The Green New Deal may be expensive  but what would you pay to save your child s life  Multiply that by millions Helena BireckiSan FranciscoTo the Editor American history is replete with what seemed to be  at the time  overly ambitious public policies  Kennedy s pronouncement to put a man on the moon  The Eisenhower administration s Interstate highways  And  of course  Franklin D  Roosevelt s creation of Social Security The Green New Deal should be included in the debate over new public policies and receive scrutiny from experts to ensure that the proposals are judged on their merits Mark M  SpradleyChevy Chase  Md To the Editor  To Cut Emissions Faster  U S  Can Apply These Policies   news article  Feb  21  shamefully fails to include animal agriculture  which is the second leading source of greenhouse gas emissions  Not one of the seven steps to reduce emissions even mentions the problem  The article proposes a step to include electric car incentives  even though emissions from animal agriculture surpass those from the entire transportation sector   cars  trucks  trains  planes and ships combined We cannot continue to ignore the myriad problems with the meat economy  including its huge effect on carbon emissions John SanbonmatsuWorcester  Mass To the Editor Your editorial supporting the Green New Deal despite some of its unrealistic elements is right on the mark  The problem is that it might now be too late given the speed needed to overcome the extreme warming that has already occurred and the significant damage inflicted by the Trump administration on the Obama administration s environmental policies Historians might well focus on the 2016 campaign that resulted in the election of an unqualified climate denier as the death sentence to life on earth as we know it  They might also cast considerable blame on the mainstream media for its entertainment dominated coverage  which resulted in what you refer to as the  hard to believe  fact that not one question about climate change was asked in the presidential debates Mr  Trump proudly referred to climate change as a  hoax  despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary  If the debate moderators had repeatedly asked him for evidence to support this claim and the media had given as much time to this issue as to Hillary Clinton s emails  then perhaps the Obama climate policies would still be intact  some form of the Green New Deal would not appear so unrealistic  and we now might have a fighting chance to save life on earth as we know it Harold J  SmithWhite Plains
SANTIAGO  Chile   What will happen to Venezuela s opposition leader  and the movement he leads  when he returns to Venezuela That question has been asked across South America since Juan Guaidó left his country more than a week ago  defying a travel ban from Venezuela s courts to embark on a largely improvised tour of the continent to shore up support For his followers  the return can t come soon enough  as his continued absence raises questions about the momentum of the movement he began  I think it s confused the people because it s left us without a road map   it risks people losing faith in his project   said María Durán  who works at a nongovernmental organization in Caracas  the Venezuelan capital   There are people who ask  What happened  Originally  Mr  Guaidó had vowed to be back on Feb  23  planning to go in with a humanitarian aid shipment meant to pierce a military blockade of the borders set up by President Nicolás Maduro  But Mr  Maduro parried off the attempt with tear gas and rubber bullets  closing border bridges into Venezuela Then  the opposition floated the idea of a return after Mr  Guaidó met on Feb  25 with Vice President Mike Pence and other regional leaders in Bogotá  Colombia  Mr  Maduro responded with an interview with ABC News saying he could have Mr  Guaidó arrested for breaking the law Now  Mr  Guaidó has set a deadline of Monday morning for his return With each additional day that Mr  Guaidó spends outside the country  he further risks losing the unity of opposition parties  which have a long history of fracturing  said Geoff Ramsey  an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America ImagePresident Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela at a rally in support of his government in Caracas in February CreditReuters At this point  the opposition doesn t need another leader in exile   Mr  Ramsey said   The more time that Guaidó spends away from Caracas  the more the opposition becomes leaderless  Mr  Guaidó has spent most of the past week on a tour of the continent  with stops in Brazil  Paraguay  Argentina and Ecuador  These regional allies are among the 50 countries  including the United States  that have recognized him as president  not Mr  Maduro  who swore himself in in January for a second term after an election widely viewed as undemocratic Yet Mr  Guaidó remains a leader without a state  and any return to Venezuela could land him in prison  They may jail him   said Lawrence Castro  an opposition lawmaker from Mr  Guaidó s political party  who has himself stayed out of Venezuela until Mr  Guaidó returns   But we have to do everything we can to enter  The Trump administration has threatened repercussions for the Maduro government should Mr  Guaidó be jailed  But Mr  Maduro has challenged the United States already with his detentions  which included briefly holding the Mexican American journalist Jorge Ramos during a confrontational interview  The Maduro government has also detained Mr  Guaidó in the past and sent the police to his home Mr  Guaidó s international tour appears to be an effort to ensure that doesn t happen again  He s asking   If I go back and am arrested  then what will you do    said Alejandro Velasco  a historian of Venezuela at New York University The tour of regional capitals has also given the opposition time to regroup after a bruising loss over the aid shipment Mr  Guaidó had raised hopes among his supporters  who have suffered severe food shortages  with promises that an  aid avalanche  would flood the country with food and medicine   and turn Mr  Maduro s military against him  But armed gangs and soldiers loyal to the government easily blocked the aid  and supporters were reduced to throwing stones to express their anger ImageMr  Guaidó  center  with President Sebastián Piñera of Chile  far right  President Iván Duque of Colombia  second from right  and Luis Almagro  head of the Organization of American States  far left  in front of aid trucks in Colombia on Feb  23 CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesThe opposition faced further setbacks when it tried to escalate the dispute  calling for a military intervention by Venezuela s neighbors to oust Mr  Maduro  In a meeting last Monday in Bogotá  most leaders attending rebuffed the call  The Trump administration has ruled out using the military to force aid into the country With Mr  Maduro firmly controlling the borders  and defections from his military so far numbering only in the hundreds  the opposition is being forced to accept that the government s rule appears to be more durable than Mr  Guaidó had painted it Ricardo Reyes  a journalist in Caracas  said that in Venezuela that message had been sinking in   A transition process isn t easy and sometimes drags on more than you thought  especially when your Plan A didn t work out   he said Given Mr  Maduro s continued hold  the international community is considering compromises On Wednesday  the secretary general of the Organization of American States  Luis Almagro  who is one of Mr  Guaidó s chief international supporters  said he would not object to Mr  Maduro s running for office again if a new election was free and fair  Mr  Almagro had previously joined hard liners in demanding that the president step down On his stops abroad  Mr  Guaidó has been greeted as a head of state  a contrast to his secretive  undercover departure from Venezuela to defy a travel ban His trip began in Brazil  where he met the new president  Jair Bolsonaro  a right wing populist who has referred to leftists there as  red outlaws  and threatened to drive them out  Mr  Guaidó also met with Lenín Moreno  Ecuador s center left president  to show that he has support on both sides of the political divide In Argentina  Mr  Guaidó was greeted by large crowds of Venezuelans  many of whom had fled the economic crisis over which Mr  Maduro has presided  There is no turning back   Mr  Guaidó told a crowd gathered at a square in Buenos Aires   The only turning back we will do is when we go back home  And I promise you that will be soon  
A New Zealand native who joined the Islamic State should not lose his citizenship but may face charges if he returns home  the country s prime minister said on Monday  outlining a milder approach than Britain and the United States have taken toward citizens with ties to the group The New Zealander  Mark Taylor  was widely ridiculed when he forgot to turn off Twitter s location tagging function in 2014  and inadvertently gave away the positions of Islamic State fighters in Syria On Monday  the ABC  Australia s public broadcaster  quoted Mr  Taylor as saying that he had fled the Islamic State in December and surrendered to Kurdish forces because living with the terrorist group had become too difficult  The ABC said he was being held in a Kurdish prison Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters on Monday that New Zealand had plans in place for any Islamic State fighters who try to return  Mr  Taylor only holds New Zealand citizenship  and the government has an obligation not to make people stateless   she said  adding that Mr  Taylor was among a small number of New Zealanders who had joined the Islamic State   She declined to say precisely how many  Ms  Ardern said that joining the group was illegal and that Mr  Taylor  who officials say does not appear to have a valid passport or travel documents  could face charges if he returns to New Zealand  To return  he would first have to travel to a country where New Zealand has a diplomatic presence and request an emergency travel document  she said Britain and the United States have recently taken a harsher line on citizens trying to return after stints with the Islamic State President Trump has said the United States will not readmit Hoda Muthana  an American born woman who traveled to Syria to join the group and now wants to come home  His administration has also signaled that former Islamic State fighters could be sent to the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay  Cuba Britain s home secretary  Sajid Javid  who is in charge of citizenship and immigration  has rebuffed pleas to return from Shamima Begum  a 19 year old woman who traveled to Syria four years ago to marry an Islamic State fighter Ms  Begum has asked to return for the sake of her newborn son  and British law prevents the government from stripping someone s citizenship if doing so would render the person stateless  But British news outlets have reported that the Home Office decided it could revoke Ms  Begum s citizenship because her mother has a passport from Bangladesh  which would typically qualify the daughter for citizenship there The Home Office said last month that while it could not comment on individual cases  Mr  Javid has the power to deprive a British national of his or her citizenship  in order to protect this country   so long as doing so does not render the person stateless Mr  Taylor  the New Zealander   who is known by his Twitter alias   Kiwi Jihadi    traveled to Syria in 2014  He told the ABC that he had worked as a guard on the border between territory controlled by the Islamic State and the Syrian government  There s a difference between fighting and guarding   he said   Guarding  you don t need to plan anything  attacking  you need to make preparations  Mr  Taylor appeared in an Islamic State promotional video that called for attacks on celebrations in Australia and New Zealand for Anzac Day  a holiday that commemorates those countries  citizens who died in overseas wars  He told the ABC that he had witnessed several beheadings and executions during his time with the group He also said he that expected New Zealand to eventually take him back  but that he would probably need to spend  a couple of years  in prison  I m sorry for causing too much trouble and being a bit hotheaded and flamboyant in my approach   said Mr  Taylor  who also goes by the names Muhammad Daniel and Abu Abdul Rahman Mr  Taylor said that he regretted not being able to afford a female slave from the Yazidi ethnic minority Islamic State fighters enslaved  raped and killed thousands of Yazidis after storming their communities in Iraq s Sinjar region in 2014  The systematic rape of Yazidi women and girls eventually became deeply enmeshed in the group s radical theology 
While he was the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida in 2007  Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta oversaw a plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein  the New York financier accused of sexually abusing more than 80 underage girls  Rich and well connected   his friends and acquaintances included Prince Andrew  Bill Clinton  Kevin Spacey  Woody Allen and Donald Trump   Mr  Epstein faced a 53 page federal indictment that could have put him in prison for life  according to The Miami Herald  which ran a blockbuster expose in November  The F B I  was also investigating him on suspicion of masterminding an international sex trafficking operation But Mr  Acosta s office  working closely with Mr  Epstein s high priced defense team   stocked with legal stars such as Alan Dershowitz  Kenneth Starr  Jay Lefkowitz and Roy Black   put together a non prosecution agreement that let Mr  Epstein avoid federal charges  plead guilty to two state counts of felony prostitution  and serve less than 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach County jail  with most days spent on work release in his office in West Palm Beach  Mr  Epstein was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to some of the young women  but the agreement shut down the F B I  investigation and gave immunity to all  potential co conspirators    including any of Mr  Epstein s rich and powerful buddies who may have taken a turn with his victims  It was a deal so sweet it would rot your teeth  It also turned out to be illegal Last Thursday  after a decade long court battle begun by two of Mr  Epstein s accusers  a federal judge ruled that Mr  Acosta and his team violated the federal Crime Victims  Rights Act by hiding the details of Mr  Epstein s deal from his victims   many of whom didn t know a deal had been in the works until they heard about it on the news  This denied the young women an opportunity to appear at Mr  Epstein s sentencing hearing  The victims were also led to believe that the F B I  investigation would continue  It was a betrayal of countless young women   the full tally of Mr  Epstein s victims remains unknown   who d already had their bodies violated and their innocence destroyed If even a fraction of the accusations against him are true  Mr  Epstein was no ordinary predator   Those with a weak stomach may want to skip ahead   For years  he allegedly turned his Palm Beach mansion into a sex den  luring in teenagers whom he paid and coerced into an array of sexual behavior  Mr  Epstein reportedly groomed some of the teenagers to recruit even younger  fresher victims  He was said to like his girls white and prepubescent looking  One victim has recalled that Mr  Epstein praised her as  pure    she was 14 at the time   before molesting her  Like many predators  he preferred his victims troubled  making them easier to manipulate and less likely to be believed if they reported him Mr  Epstein reportedly had victims brought in up to three times a day  some from out of state  others from out of the country  More grotesque still  he was suspected of loaning girls out to his friends  hosting sex parties at his homes in the Caribbean  Manhattan  and New Mexico  In New York  a lawsuit is pending that accuses Mr  Epstein of employing a modeling agency to import girls as young as 13 from Europe and South America In response to The Herald s expose  congressional lawmakers urged the Department of Justice to look into federal prosecutors  handling of Mr  Epstein s case  The Office of Professional Responsibility opened a misconduct investigation last month  Its findings will be reported back to lawmakers In last week s ruling  Judge Kenneth Marra noted that the Crime Victims  Rights Act  authorizes the rescission or  reopening  of a prosecutorial agreement  including a non prosecution agreement  reached in violation of a prosecutor s conferral obligations under the statute   Senator Ben Sasse  Republican of Nebraska  is agitating for such action   Jeffrey Epstein is a monster  and his victims deserve justice   the senator has charged  calling on the Justice Department to  reopen its non prosecution agreement so that Epstein and anyone else who abused these children are held accountable  Accountability would be a refreshing change in this horror story  While Mr  Acosta was coddling a credibly accused monster  Mr  Epstein s victims were being misled and stripped of their rights by the very people whose job it was to deliver them justice  In a 2011 letter to the media  Mr  Acosta defensively whined that he d faced  a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors  from Mr  Epstein s intimidating legal team  His capitulation suggests he lacks the spine and moral decency to continue as labor secretary During his 2017 confirmation hearings  Mr  Acosta brushed back questions about Mr  Epstein  insisting that he had done his best  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  opposed his nomination  contending that Mr  Acosta s handling of the case   suggests he won t put the interests of workers and everyday people ahead of the powerful and well connected  Ms  Feinstein was being generous  The Epstein case shows that under Mr  Acosta  the rich and powerful got away with the most vile offenses  Both Congress and the administration must demand answers  both for Mr  Epstein s victims and the American public  RelatedLabor Secretary Faces Heat Over Plea Deal for Financier Accused of Serial Sex AbuseFeb  25  2019Opinion   Michelle GoldbergWhy Does Alex

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  Recently Mayor Bill de Blasio went to Iowa  not for the first time  presumably to vision board a bid for the presidency despite his public equivocations  Over the course of two stops  one in Sioux City and another in Des Moines  roughly 65 people came out to see him  a number that might disappoint even organizers of a municipal town hall on new concepts in recycling  Never one to be deterred by absurdly long odds  he is on his way to Florida this weekend Let s take it as a matter of certainty that with a 43 percent approval rating in the city he runs and no reality television franchise to explode his fan base  Mr  de Blasio has little chance of becoming the next president of the United States  Delusion often protects us from acknowledging life s unsettling ironies  Six years ago  when he was elected the mayor of New York  in a landslide of the kind not seen since 1985  he was poised to become the country s most prominent voice of the progressive left It is easy to forget how concisely he delivered his message on the corrosive effects of inequality and how much it resonated when he campaigned in 2013  a moment when few politicians of his stature were branding themselves so definitively this way And yet by the time of the Democratic National Convention in 2016  Mr  de Blasio was relegated to a minor speaking slot scheduled during rush hour on the East Coast  This was partly retribution for his slow reflex to endorse the Democratic nominee  but it made clear how little currency he actually had with a new and growing movement he was so crucial in fomenting Now  even if he were to serve merely as a traveling salesman for a particular strain of liberal problem solving  something he seems compelled to do  Mr  de Blasio could easily be a liability to Democrats in the 2020 election cycle On the one hand  a new wave of progressives shares little of his comfort with real estate and other moneyed interests  This was clear when his initial support of Amazon s expansion in New York was met with a fury he did not anticipate  He could not see that his relentless focus on the 25 000 jobs Amazon promised was misguided given low unemployment rates and the increasing number of technology jobs that have already come to New York  Good jobs are available to New Yorkers  what they don t have is affordable housing  and that is a problem Amazon wasn t going to solve Beyond that  the mayor is especially vulnerable to attacks from the right that would  predictably  suggest that his administration has embodied the failure of so called big government  It is hard to defend his disastrous handling of the New York City Housing Authority  which has been troubled and underfunded for decades but reached peak crisis during his tenure  with lies and obfuscations about lead paint inspections and the increasing debilitation of the buildings themselves Just this week at a panel discussion on the future of Brooklyn  the urban planner and Yale professor Alexander Garvin  who oversaw the development of Lower Manhattan after the attacks of Sept  11  argued that the city has passively and pointlessly waited for federal money to repair public housing   money that was never going to come   instead of pursuing innovative means of financing those repairs itself  through bond issues The troubled subway system and Mr  de Blasio s unsuccessful Renewal schools initiative simply provide more bait for privatization hawks to discredit the viability of a liberal approach to accomplishing fundamental problems with infrastructure and education that plague the whole country While blame for the dysfunctional transit system can largely be laid at the feet of Gov  Andrew Cuomo  the mayor s inability to work with him as a grown up has only made things worse  It took Mr  de Blasio until the last possible minute to get behind a congestion pricing plan that could divert revenue to subway repairs The mayor is increasingly oblivious  This week he rode the subway and seemed surprised to discover just how exasperated New Yorkers are with their inability to get to where they are going without delays and hassles and endless anxiety  What I gleaned is people really depend on their subways   Mr  de Blasio said at a news conference later  sounding as if he were a tourist from Havana with limited access to the tens of thousands of words that have been devoted to this subject by the local press during the past few years   Some days I get to work on time  some days I m a half hour late  45 minutes late    Mr  de Blasio continued  recounting the conversations he had on the train   You can hear the frustration   That frustration has been within audible range for a very long time Mr  de Blasio s style seems particularly ill suited to a moment when personality politics have entered a new and hypercharged phase  when the ability to create an obsession both among one s own constituents and the opposition seems so essential to getting ahead  Mr  de Blasio has always dismissed the criticisms that he is too earnest  too arrogant  too unlikable  too aloof  But how does he plan to compete in a world of Donald Trump rage tweets and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez talking to voters as she sings in her kitchen or chops squash Somewhere he may have the knives to cut through  but they all lack the edge 
BEIJING   China is poised to approve a sweeping rewrite of the country s laws on foreign investment that it hopes will help pacify the United States and ease a rancorous trade dispute  The new rules would respond to some concerns among foreign governments and businesses but disregard many other worries China has been locked in a bruising struggle with the United States over the Trump administration s contentions that Beijing has repeatedly forced foreign companies to hand over technological secrets as a condition of doing business in China  and has failed to protect American companies  products from counterfeiting and other illegal copying  Beijing has denied any shortcomings in its existing practices  and the new law does call for tighter enforcement But the new law is made up of many single sentence pronouncements on complex issues  with no details on how those rules would be carried out  This is good  but it s not enough   said Carlo Diego D Andrea  the chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in China There are some signs that a settlement of the trade war may be coming soon  Still  the new foreign investment law  if passed  would bar local and provincial officials from requiring that foreign companies transfer technology to Chinese companies The most recent published draft  issued in late December  made no mention of preventing national government regulators from demanding technology transfers The National People s Congress said on Monday that it will debate the draft law on Friday and vote on it a week later at the close of the session  Approval is essentially automatic in the 2 975 member congress  which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party  although there is some room for last minute amendments  The congress s 11 day annual session opens on Tuesday Zhang Yesui  the spokesman for the congress  said the law would  improve the openness  transparency and predictability of the investment environment  and provide more effective legal protection for the formation of a new  open system  Chinese experts say the legislation would be a big improvement over the current environment in which foreign investment is regulated by three separate laws Foreign experts are less sure  The European Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement last week that the language used in the law was overly broad The 2015 draft of the same law  which the legislature never approved  had 170 articles  But the final draft released for public comment in late December had just 39 articles  a third of which are a single sentence each ImageZhang Yesui  right  a National People s Congress spokesman  said the new law would  provide more effective legal protection for the formation of a new  open system  CreditNg Han Guan Associated PressOver the last several years  as Chinese officials mused publicly about the possibility of a new law  there were some calls from foreign and domestic businesses for the laws on foreign investment to be merged with the laws for Chinese investors Foreign businesses contended that they should be allowed to compete based on the same rules as local businesses  Some Chinese businesses also favored merging the domestic and foreign investment laws in the hope that they would be given more protection  For example  the draft foreign investment law requires that companies be fairly compensated if their assets are seized by the state   a rule that might benefit Chinese companies if they were in a similar situation The European Chamber criticized the government for retaining separate rules for foreign investors  And Ker Gibbs  the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai  said that  foreign businesses should receive equal treatment and only be restricted from investing in areas that truly impact national security interests  Western business groups are also particularly concerned that the law would require foreign companies to share detailed information about their operations under a new reporting system  That system would be used to keep score of how well foreign companies  subsidiaries complied with local and national regulations  including areas like pollution  head count and labor disputes Business groups wanted the law to include a ban on the sharing of information from the reporting system with Chinese competitors  But the most recently released draft does not include such a provision Foreign business groups and business leaders have also been caught off guard by the way that China has fast tracked the process of reviewing the new law In China  draft laws often go through reviews that take several years  In this case  the law looked set to be voted on less than three months after being introduced  although a different  more comprehensive draft had been circulated by China s Commerce Ministry in 2015 The standing committee of the legislature held an initial review of the new law on Dec  26 and then issued the draft for public comment  It then held a second review at the end of January  just before the start of Chinese New Year celebrations and nearly a month before the deadline for public comments Many foreign executives were out of town on vacation during both reviews  so there has been little discussion of the new law s impact  The European Union criticized the government for moving faster on the legislation than China s own rules for public comment normally allow The draft law would establish a complaints procedure for foreign companies  But it indicates that such cases may be heard in Chinese courts  which are under the tight control of the Communist Party  Many judges in China have limited legal training and are chosen for political loyalty James Zimmerman  a partner in the Beijing office of the Perkins Coie law firm  said that if the final version of the legislation next week called for cases to be heard in Chinese courts  practically no Western businesses would want to use the process Western companies have been afraid of antagonizing Chinese regulators  who have broad powers to retaliate  They have also been reluctant even to tell their home countries  international trade offices about cases in which they believe Beijing is violating its commitments to the World Trade Organization So it is far from clear that they will start suing the Chinese government in its own courts  Why would someone want to involve themselves in a politically driven process like that   Mr  Zimmerman asked 
Democrats and Republicans are working together to help poor people get training for better jobs  That might seem hard to believe these days  but it s true The Jobs Act  introduced by Senator Tim Kaine  Democrat of Virginia  and Senator Rob Portman  Republican of Ohio  attracted 12 bipartisan co sponsors  including three Democrats who are running for president  Similar legislation was introduced in the House  It could very well become law Unfortunately  a raft of research suggests this well meaning bill may actually hurt the students it is designed to help Currently  low income students can use Pell grants to pay for bachelor s degrees  associate s degrees and shorter certificate programs that last at least 15 weeks  The Jobs Act would drop the minimum to eight weeks for any  job training program  offered by an accredited college  Eligible students would receive up to about  3 000   half a Pell grant   to pay tuition The intent is to modernize the college financial aid system to help students get jobs quickly   We ve perpetrated a myth that post high school has to be college   Mr  Kaine  the son of an iron worker and welder  said at a Senate Education Committee hearing   There are all kinds of career and technical programs where there is significant need in the work force  Mr  Kaine and Mr  Portman promised they would allow the abridged Pell grants to support only  high quality and rigorous  programs  But the bill doesn t have an effective mechanism for ensuring quality  As written  it could touch off a new wave of exploitation by the same for profit colleges that have already wasted billions of taxpayer dollars and left some vulnerable students with mountains of debt When it comes to quality  the existing Pell grant system largely lets colleges police themselves  There is no accountability for whether students get jobs after they graduate or how much they earn  That s less of a problem for bachelor s degree programs because there is much evidence on the long term economic benefit of a B A   especially for low income students  Even much maligned liberal arts degrees tend to pay off in the end Short term training programs have only one purpose  If they don t lead to better jobs and wages  they have failed  And study after study finds that too many such programs are  in fact  failing The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that while certificate programs increase earnings on average   there are many certificates   especially in fields of study with high concentrations of women   that do not confer a substantial wage premium over a high school degree  Who offers these failing programs  Often  for profit colleges that enroll large numbers of students  An analysis from the left leaning Center for American Progress found that  of the 15 certificate programs with the most graduates  10 have typical earnings of  18 000 or less  for students two to four years after they leave school   This includes the two largest program types   medical assisting and cosmetology   which have typical earnings of  15 309 and  12 272  respectively   In many states  cosmetology is dominated by for profit schools  The same is true for medical assisting  with duties like checking vital signs and scheduling appointments   And these dismal results are for programs that last at least 15 weeks  Smaller programs could be even less effective In addition to shortchanging women  the limitations of short term certificates are also stratified by race  Georgetown researchers found that one in six African Americans report their highest level of education as a certificate  compared with one in nine among Hispanic  Asian  and white Americans  Yet African Americans get the smallest earnings boost for their short term credentials Nothing in the Jobs Act would change these dynamics  The bill says job training programs must  meet the hiring requirements of potential employers   But it allows individual colleges  including for profits  to decide whether their own programs qualify  That laissez faire approach to regulation recently led to widespread fraud and abuse  saddling hundreds of thousands of students with bad loans In response  the Obama administration cracked down on the for profit industry  The Trump administration is in the process of dismantling the Obama rules Columbia University researchers have found that the positive benefits of short term certificates  may fade out within a few years post college   The benefits of longer term credentials  by contrast  persist  Yet only about one in four students whose first credential is a short term certificate go on to earn an associate s or bachelor s degree within six years  For those over 24  it s closer to one in five There are other ways to lift workers who need better jobs  Services like career advising and job search assistance have been shown to help  On the job learning can also be effective  But the Jobs Act doesn t fund such assistance  because the Pell grant program wasn t designed to fund job training  Instead  the bill leaves students at the mercy of a higher education market that routinely fails them  The students buy training that  especially for women and students of color  often doesn t work All of these issues are likely to play out on a larger stage as Democrats vying for the presidency propose large new federal investments in higher learning  and Congress begins the once a decade task of reauthorizing the federal Higher Education Act It s appealing to think that for just  3 000  and just eight weeks  students could get enough training to begin better careers  That s probably why so many politicians from both sides of the aisle have signed onto the Jobs Act  But short training programs of wildly uneven quality are already contributing to a growing wealth gap along race and gender lines  Making them even shorter could make that disparity even worse Kevin Carey directs the education policy

DOHA  Qatar   American negotiators and Taliban officials set to resume negotiations in the Qatari capital on Saturday expressed guarded optimism that they are getting closer to an agreement that could help end 17 years of conflict  America s longest war During a two day break from direct negotiations at a holiday resort in Doha  a series of small meetings continued around town to bridge the gap on core issues  such as withdrawal of American troops and prohibiting international terror groups from using Afghan soil  according to several current and former officials from all sides involved in the talks  There is progress   Sohail Shaheen  a spokesman for the Taliban s negotiating team  said in an interview on Friday   The technical groups are working on the details of a draft agreement about troop pullout from Afghanistan  and also that Afghanistan s soil must not be a haven for anyone to use it against other countries  We have moved the agreement forward  but we have not completed it  But a host of complications remain  including the continued violence  as neither side has given up making attacks  Even as negotiators were sounding hopeful in Doha  Taliban fighters assaulted a large Afghan Army base in Helmand Province where United States Marines are present  killing at least two dozen Afghan soldiers Nevertheless  officials on both sides described a growing rapport between Zalmay Khalilzad  the American special envoy leading the negotiations  and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar  the Taliban s deputy leader  who is for the first time taking a more direct role in negotiations Mullah Baradar met twice with Mr  Khalilzad and Gen  Austin S  Miller  the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan  joined by Qatar s foreign minister in the second of those meetings ImageAmerican envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said   We continue to take slow  steady steps toward understanding and eventually peace  CreditJim Huylebroek for The New York TimesIn the two full days of negotiations before the sides took a break  the main negotiating teams  led by Mr  Khalilzad for the United States and Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai for the Taliban  were supported by technical teams in side rooms off the conference hall  In the Taliban s technical room  many delegation members scribbled in notebooks  while one had a single MacBook at the table  Mullah Baradar occasionally came in to the technical room to consult  We continue to take slow  steady steps toward understanding and eventually peace   Mr  Khalilzad said Other conflicts in the region  however  are complicating the peace effort  Enmity between Qatar and Saudi Arabia has been an issue hanging over the direct talks since they started late last year  And the conflict in recent days between Pakistan and India over Kashmir has also injected uncertainty  officials said There is also a large gap between the American and Taliban delegations over the Americans  insistence that the Taliban agree to talk with the Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani about the political future of the country before any troop withdrawal can be finalized The Taliban have refused  angering Mr  Ghani  who has repeatedly expressed concern that the current talks  bypassing of his administration is further destabilizing the already fragile Afghan state  Mr  Ghani s government was excluded from talks between Afghan political opposition leaders and the Taliban in Moscow last month Officials here said that part of the smaller sessions over the past two days have focused on what it would take to reach a cease fire   another core American demand on the Taliban  Some officials said that one thing being discussed is whether to start with region specific cease fires   rather than a nationwide truce   that would coincide with an American troop pullout in those regions Officials suggested that even on the issue of future talks that could include the Afghan government there were hopeful signs  One possibility floated for reaching a compromise is that an Afghan negotiating team including government officials and other political leaders would come to Doha as part of a bigger group of Afghans  It remains to be seen how acceptable that is to President Ghani ImageThe Taliban have so far refused to meet with the Afghan government  angering Afghan President Ashraf Ghani CreditMohammad Ismail ReutersMr  Shaheen  the Taliban delegation s spokesman  said the insurgents  position remained the same  They will continue speaking to Afghans  such as the gathering in Moscow  but not negotiate with Mr  Ghani s representatives if  they are participating as a government   There are two different aspects   one is with the Americans  Once that is finalized  then we will come to the internal side   Mr  Shaheen said   If we recognize it as a government  there is no justification for fighting  Adding to the complexity are the conflicts between other nations in the broader region Qatar  the host of the talks  is isolated by a blockade against it by Saudi Arabia and its gulf allies  A recent Saudi push to become part of American peace efforts frustrated the Qataris  who had long hosted the Taliban at the request of the Americans during the Obama administration But Mr  Khalizad  entrusted last year by the Trump administration to move urgently to engage the Taliban in talks  had his doubts about just how authoritative the Taliban representatives in Doha were  according to two senior officials who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations  So Mr  Khalizad also engaged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in his efforts  Both countries are influential with Pakistan  where the Taliban s most senior leaders still have sanctuary But that effort angered Qatari officials  And the regional rivalries also became too much for the Taliban  which for the most part preferred to work through its office in Qatar on a smaller negotiating agenda Another conflict has been the flare up between Pakistan and India As the two nuclear states shot at each other across the border and conducted airstrikes in recent days  the foreign minister of Pakistan came out to remind the Americans that any chaos between India and Pakistan could affect the Taliban talks  The regional dimension has to be handled in a way that builds support among the regional actors without importing their separate conflicts into Afghanistan   said Laurel Miller  a former senior American diplomat now leading the Asia program at the International Crisis Group 
Nobody knows for sure who the real president of Venezuela is at the moment  Nicolás Maduro  who was sworn in on Jan  10  or Juan Guaidó  who shortly afterward assumed the powers of the presidency  on behalf of the legislature Mr  Guaidó has captured the heart of the nation  A vast majority of Venezuelans support him  All political parties in Venezuela other than the ruling party accept his legal argument   that Mr  Maduro s 2018 re election was fraudulent  He returned to his homeland today   once again challenging a travel ban imposed on him by Maduro s regime   after touring five Latin American countries to shore up support for democracy in Venezuela Mr  Maduro has the heart of only one institution  the military  This was evidenced on Feb  23  when he used brute military force to successfully block the entry of humanitarian aid  killing civilians  and in Nero like fashion  set some delivery trucks on fire  while he danced salsa on national television The question is how to confront Mr  Maduro s military assault without turning to military action  This is Venezuela s predicament  As a peaceful resolution appears increasingly unlikely  Mr  Guaidó has called on the opposition allies to mediate or intervene Most analysts  including me  agree that foreign intervention is too risky  The logistics are too complicated  and the enterprise would put the duplicitous Trump administration in the driver s seat  which would calm no one s nerves However  a few alternatives exist short of militarizing the conflict  even though they still would involve some degree of militarization  To understand this  we must first understand how Mr  Maduro s military operates In every authoritarian regime  military support is the sine qua non of regime survival  Remove the support of the military and the dictator falls  In that sense  the Maduro regime fits the conventional model of authoritarian politics  Democratization requires decoupling the military from Maduro But the politics of decoupling the military from Maduro has proved complicated because Mr  Maduro s military alliance  in many respects  is more unconventional than not  His military is not a single  professional  vertical organization  It comprises multiple elements  each with its own interest in supporting the regime  A strategy to divorce it from Mr  Maduro requires deploying policies to address each of those groups There s the standard military establishment  which in Venezuela consists of professional career soldiers  Then there are nonstandard groups  They include ideologized soldiers  working together with Cuban military and intelligence officials to crack down on dissent  They also include bureaucrat generals who support Mr  Maduro because they have good jobs running state owned corporations  and profit seeking soldiers  who are making a fortune trafficking in illicit markets  including the drug trade  Finally  there are Maduro s killing agents  in charge of repressing Before the 2000s  the possibility of this type of diversity within the military was hardly discussed in military politics textbooks  Today  this diversity  or what political scientists are calling the new oligopoly of state violence  is what undemocratic regimes and failed states prefer  And in Venezuela  this oligopoly is dominated by the criminal minded soldiers and killing agents Killing agents in particular have become the hallmark of Mr  Maduro s rule  They comprise two groups  the Special Actions Forces  or FAES  created in 2017 to combat crime but in reality charged with conducting politically motivated killings in poor neighborhoods  and the so called colectivos  armed civilians paid by the government  In the early 2000s  colectivos were community organized reservists  Today they consist mostly of delinquents  thugs and even former inmates  They show up on motorcycles at protests  gun in hand and with their faces covered  to terrorize participants  Colectivos spare professional soldiers from the need to repress The problem with Mr  Guaidó s strategy   in fact  any peaceful and democratic strategy to demilitarize a regime   is that it cannot easily address the concerns of these disparate military groups Some can be addressed with policies already offered by the interim president  For instance  Mr  Guaidó s offer of transitional justice  amnesty  with fair elections has enormous appeal to scared soldiers and many professional soldiers  This is why we are seeing defections by many of these soldiers But there is little in Mr  Guaidó s policies that would appeal to hard core ideologues  for profit and criminal soldiers  and colectivos  Hard core ideologues are likely to stand with Mr  Maduro unconditionally  The for profit generals will gain little from transitional justice  They will be left without status and profits even if their transgressions are forgiven  And the colectivos are especially hard to deal with because they are the least controllable group   they are too decentralized and have no corporate interest to defend Transitioning to democracy in Venezuela will require putting order to this fragmented military  The darkest groups within this institution cannot be invited to join a democratic movement   that would produce an instant conflict of interest  Instead  these groups need to be neutralized somehow A civilian alone cannot do it  Only actors from within the military establishment   those who know the identities of the armed actors within their ranks  their businesses and deals   can do the revamping of the military that is needed Mr  Guaidó and his international allies may have no option but to entertain an interim civilian military partnership under some form of international tutelage  They need to continue to reach out to some of the more honest military officers  those interested in the integrity of the institution  to turn against not just Mr  Maduro but also the disparate groups across the military  The mission  Bring the military institution back to order This will of course require applying a combination of force and some concessions to the least professional groups within the military  Smart witness protection programs along with an expansion of amnesty provisions will need to be offered  Economic opportunities will need to be found for both profit seeking soldiers and colectivos The transition to democracy  given the fragmented and dark nature of Venezuela s military  will therefore never be a clean  overnight transition from military rule to civilian rule  It will require a transition period that no doubt will be unpleasant for Venezuelan democrats  But it is better than the war based stalemate that the country is in or the United States led intervention that many are increasingly calling for  RelatedMore from Opinion on Venezuela Opinion   Juan GuaidóJuan Guaidó  Venezuelans  Strength Is in UnityJan  30  2019Opinion   Michael ShifterCan Venezuela Have a

Good morning  If you don t already get California Today emailed to you  here s the sign up  Over the weekend  District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert announced that the Sacramento police officers who killed Stephon Clark would not face criminal charges Mr  Clark  a 22 year old  unarmed black man  was shot last year in his grandmother s backyard  Police officers fired their weapons 20 times in Mr  Clark s direction within seconds of turning a blind corner  A Times analysis of video of the shooting found that the gunfire continued after Mr  Clark had fallen to his hands and knees  Was a crime committed  There s no question that a human being died   Ms  Schubert said on Saturday in Sacramento   But when we look at the facts and the law  and we follow our ethical responsibilities  the answer to that question is no  The announcement led to a new round of protests in the city  as well as renewed calls for justice from Mr  Clark s family  including from his brother  Stevante Clark  I would like for the attorney general to prosecute the officers   Mr  Clark said at a news conference   I want justice and accountability  Attorney General Xavier Becerra is expected to release the results of his own investigation into the shooting soon and has previously said his office has the authority to bring charges  regardless of Ms  Schubert s decision  according to The Sacramento Bee Mr  Becerra s office has recently been involved in a range of high profile issues He s positioned his office at the forefront of California s resistance against President Trump s policies  suing the administration more than 45 times And the tenure of his predecessor  Senator Kamala Harris  has been scrutinized as she runs for president It s a big job   and a clear launchpad for leaders with big political ambitions   Ms  Harris s predecessor  Jerry Brown  But what are the limits of the attorney general s power  And does the office have a core mandate I asked David A  Carrillo  executive director of U C  Berkeley s California Constitution Center  about the job Essentially  he said  its charge is very broad  The office has a wide array of responsibilities under two broad categories  acting as the state s lawyer  and as its highest law enforcement official   Mr  Carrillo said in an email  The latter gives the attorney general some power over local prosecutors  sheriffs and police chiefs While he wouldn t comment on any specific attorney general  Mr  Carrillo said that breadth of responsibility means whoever s in the role sets his or her own legal priorities during the term In the case of PG E s bankruptcy  for instance  the attorney general has the power to file lawsuits or intervene in existing actions  including appearing on California s behalf in a federal bankruptcy proceeding  Mr  Carrillo said If the attorney general believes it s necessary  they can also take on any criminal investigations  refer matters to county prosecutors or convene a grand jury to consider any criminal matters  In the event of a conflict of interest  the attorney general could employ a special counsel to handle a prosecution Finally  Mr  Carrillo said  the sheer volume of issues the attorney general s office deals with means that while battles with the federal government might be more attention grabbing  they re actually a sliver of the office s caseload  In fact  he said  it was recently estimated that federal cases absorb about 1 percent of the departmental budget Nevertheless  Mr  Carrillo said it s important for states to occasionally push back against the federal government  These conflicts happen frequently  across the nation  regardless of the party in power or era   he said   States should advance their citizens  interests  and doing so is essential to maintaining the balance of power between the states and the federal government  Here s what else we re following today We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers  We appreciate your reading Times

The new AT T is coming into focus On Monday the company took a step closer to becoming something never before seen on the American corporate landscape   part telecommunications behemoth and part media entertainment giant The transformation started in earnest last June when AT T  based in Dallas  ventured beyond its core business and muscled into New York and Los Angeles with its  85 4 billion acquisition of Time Warner  the former home of HBO  the Warner Bros  movie studio  CNN and cable channels like TBS and TNT  Last week  the deal was set in stone when the Justice Department  after losing a hard fought appeal to block it  said it would no longer try to undo the merger With this final green light  AT T has in recent days altered its leadership team with an eye toward reinvention On Monday  the company named Robert Greenblatt  the former head of entertainment at NBC and Showtime  as the new chairman at Warner Media  a job that will give him oversight of Time Warner properties like HBO  TBS and TNT  His hiring followed the resignations of Richard Plepler  the longtime chief executive of HBO  and David Levy  the president of Turner Broadcasting  the division that includes TBS and TNT As part of its executive shake up  AT T   which gained 26 000 employees in the merger  giving it 268 000 worldwide   also promoted the CNN chief Jeff Zucker and the Warner Bros  studio head Kevin Tsujihara  both of whom will oversee bigger portfolios John Stankey  an AT T veteran who was put in charge of Warner Media at the time of the acquisition  is the executive behind the moves  which show that the company is serious about tearing up old ways and putting its own stamp on its new properties  The company s two core businesses are both facing upheaval as tech companies like Amazon  Netflix  Apple  Google and Facebook have become dominant players in both entertainment and distribution  If you don t make a change  you re not going to get any change in the product   Mr  Stankey said in an interview on Monday Mr  Stankey s assignment is to help AT T beat out its traditional rivals Verizon  T Mobile and Sprint by offering not only service plans but also  Game of Thrones  and 24 hour news  At the same time  AT T s entry into the media sphere will eventually allow it to compete in the streaming business against companies it has rarely done battle with before  including the Walt Disney Company  Comcast  Netflix  Amazon and others He emphasized that AT T didn t want to muddy the brands within Warner Media  a group comprising HBO  CNN  TNT  Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros  film and TV studios  We just needed to get them to sing and dance differently and have them take different approaches   he added With the hiring of Mr  Greenblatt   who has experience as a mainstream broadcaster at NBC and as a programmer of prestige cable fare at Showtime   Mr  Stankey believes he has someone who can make Warner Media s offerings broadly popular  without losing their distinctive identities  There aren t that many people who have both   Mr  Stankey said   He s got the right track record  Mr  Greenblatt  who goes by Bob  took over as chairman of NBC in 2011  when the network was in dire straits  Over his seven years  he brought NBC back from the dead with series like  The Voice   Dick Wolf s fleet of Chicago shows and  This Is Us   NBC  which he left in September  now regularly finishes No  1 among the advertiser prized group of 18 to 49 year old viewers In a statement  Mr  Greenblatt said   I m honored to be joining Warner Media during such an exciting time for the company and the industry as a whole  and I look forward to working alongside the many talented executives and team members across the company  While overseeing HBO and the like  Mr  Greenblatt will also manage the product that may be the most important of all  from AT T s perspective  Warner Media s streaming service  which is scheduled to debut this year Managing

for family and kids programming including Cartoon Network  Adult Swim  Boomerang  Otter Media  Turner Classic Movies and licensed consumer products          By The New York TimesOnline video has become crucial to every media business as customers cut their cable cords and go to the movies mainly for big spectacle blockbusters  Netflix and Hulu are signing up millions of new customers every quarter  and entertainment giants like Disney and Comcast plan to start their own services by the end of the year  Amazon is spending more on original shows  and Apple plans to unveil its streaming effort  with new programming  this year The appointment of Mr  Greenblatt allows Warner Media to speed up its plans for a streaming business  a process that was hampered under the older structure  Mr  Stankey said  We had to put a bit of a Band Aid organization on top of things before we made this change   he said   Still  I think we ve done a remarkable job with what we had  The new combined WarnerMedia will be much more successful filling in the gaps  AT T was handcuffed until recently as it fought a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration s Justice Department to block the merger  The company agreed to take a hands off approach to its Turner division  which includes CNN and TNT  until the appeal was concluded  AT T beat back that challenge last week  giving the company free rein Concerning the resignations of Mr  Plepler  who had been at HBO for 27 years  and Mr  Levy  who had spent 32 years at Turner Broadcasting  Mr  Stankey said   I was disappointed but I don t know that I was completely surprised   He added   When you have someone who had a tremendous amount of autonomy  they tend to covet that  Mr  Stankey plans to be a much more active steward of Warner Media than its executives had anticipated  three people familiar with the new AT T said  He has started to consolidate advertising  distribution and production departments across Turner and HBO  as well as some of the back end functions like human resources  accounting and technology  Those moves effectively took away large chunks of matters once overseen by Mr  Plepler and Mr  Levy  the people said In Mr  Stankey s view  Warner Media needed to reorganize the TV networks in a way  where they could cooperate more together   he said  which meant that some top executives would have reduced roles  He said his discussions with Mr  Plepler and Mr  Levy  which took place separately  never got far enough to explore what roles they each might accept Going up against Netflix and Disney will be tough  Mr  Stankey acknowledged that a household is likely to pay for just four or five of these services  and that AT T will have to prove its worth to consumers At a company presentation in November  he outlined three tiers of online video services that have been in the works  an entry level option centered on films  a  premium  service that includes original television programming and films  and a final product that includes both of those tiers plus classic movies  comedy and children s content  Under the plan  HBO would still be available as a stand alone service But it is unclear which Warner Media brands will be part of each tier or how each will be priced  Even the names of the video services remain a mystery  No news on that today   Mr  Stankey said on Monday The lack of hard information on the streaming strategy has frustrated executives within Warner Media  several people familiar with the internal operations have said  But some have wondered if the lack of communication was the result of the Justice Department s court challenge Mr  Stankey acknowledged that his sometimes laconic approach might have baffled those inside the organization   I ve read articles out there saying that I m not prone to flap my gums  and that may not be inaccurate   he said  But Hollywood  not used to such a reserved manner  might require him to open up more   I m trying to find a middle ground on it   he said  adding that with the lawsuit behind them  he ll be able to talk more frequently As part of the reorganization  Mr  Zucker  the head of CNN  will also begin to oversee Turner s sports operations  That includes the website Bleacher Report  as well as Turner s deals with the National Basketball Association  Major League Baseball and the National Collegiate Athletic Association  With the job  Mr  Zucker gets a new title  chairman of news and sports Mr  Tsujihara  the chief executive of the Warner Bros  movie studio  will continue in his position and also take on what Warner Media described as a  new global kids and young adults business   Children s content is likely to be a critical part of the streaming service and represents a big part of Mr  Tsujihara s portfolio  As the economics change  it s becoming more and more important to align content value  consumer products and ad sales   Mr  Tsujihara said in an interview   It takes a real need for deeper level of coordination across the different divisions  
When Paine Field  about 25 miles north of Seattle in Everett  Wash   was born in the 1930s as a New Deal project  it was envisioned as a major commercial airport for the region  But that never happened  Instead  it became known as the place where Boeing offers  North America s only publicly available commercial jet assembly plant tour  That is about to change  Thanks to private investment  Paine Field is finally set to offer air service to the public  A sleek  new   40 million  two gate terminal was built by Propeller Airports  a Seattle company  and commercial flights are set to begin this month Brett Smith  Propeller s founder and chief executive  expects that travelers will be attracted by the convenience of avoiding traffic jams near Seattle Tacoma International Airport   No reason why tax dollars should be used to build passenger travel while there s private sector money ready and willing to do it   he said As governments reduce spending on infrastructure  private companies are moving into airports big and small  paying for private terminals with new types of services and teaming up with local agencies to renovate existing terminals  The so called public private partnerships  or P3s  have created new possibilities for airports  which have struggled for years to find the money to improve terminals and accommodate an increase in passengers and cargo  An Airport Council International report released in 2017 estimated that airports would need almost  100 billion for capital projects over the next five years  but would only be able to finance about half that amount The Paine Field Passenger Terminal  which will serve Alaska Airlines starting early this month  and United Airlines later in March  is just one example of how private money is affecting airport offerings Through a subsidiary  the Schiphol Group of the Netherlands owns Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport  American Airlines owns the airport s Terminal 8  The Private Suite at Los Angeles International Airport opened nearly two years ago  offering those who can afford it a luxurious respite from the crowds at the main terminals  And Denver International Airport is updating the ticket counters  security screening areas  restaurants and shops at Jeppesen Terminal with the help of private money The flow of private money into airports may mean more dining and shopping options for passengers  but it can have downsides  Since private operators try to maximize non aeronautical revenue  some creature comforts may be lacking  We re not at the level of pay toilets  but operators may make it intentionally difficult to find a water fountain   said Henry Harteveldt  founder of Atmosphere Research Group  a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco ImageThe interior of the new terminal  Brett Smith  the founder and chief executive of Propeller  is anticipating that travelers will be attracted by the convenience of avoiding traffic jams near Seattle Tacoma International Airport CreditRodolfo MartinezThe issue of government support for public projects was thrown into sharp relief recently  when Gov  Gavin Newsom of California  a Democrat  announced that he was scaling back a  77 billion project for a high speed bullet train and the Trump administration said it was considering legal options for recovering  2 5 billion in federal money that has already been spent on the project Airport financing works somewhat differently than investment in public works projects  A government covers construction and some maintenance costs  but airports are expected to be self sufficient otherwise and to find other sources of revenue As many as a third of the airports in the United States were privately owned before the Great Depression and the infusion of New Deal spending  according to Deborah Douglas  the curator of science and technology at the M I T  Museum who has studied airports between the world wars Wartime needs changed the dynamic  The underlying principle of airport operations  beginning with World War II  was that local governments should own and operate the airports  and the federal government should provide the capital for construction and some maintenance costs   said Peter Kirsch  a partner at the law firm Kaplan  Kirsch and Rockwell who specializes in transportation Since then  Mr  Kirsch said  there has been an antipathy toward private ownership of  and investment in  public infrastructure  Local governments or airport authorities borrowed to pay for construction  But changes in the economy and in tax laws  he added  meant that  the advantage of public sector borrowing over private sector borrowing has narrowed   Because two major government sources of financing for airports   facility fees and Airport Improvement Program grants   have remained at the same levels for years  the money does not go as far as it once did Short term appropriations from Congress make it difficult for airport officials to plan long term projects  Revenue from restaurants  stores  taxis  rental cars and parking is subject to less oversight  And when third parties maintain private terminals  airports and passengers reap benefits without incurring additional expense Prospective users of Paine Field Passenger Terminal approve of the arrangement  Minda Zetlin  a writer who lives about 15 miles northeast of the airport and nearly 50 miles north of Sea Tac  said that traveling to the larger airport usually required her to use a car service  at an additional cost of  110 each way She said some of her neighbors traveled 65 miles to the airport in Bellingham  Wash   20 miles from the Canadian border  rather than fight traffic into Seattle   Sure  when there s commercial service out of Everett we ll look at that as an attractive alternative   she wrote in an email Yves Junqueira  the founder and chief executive of a Seattle start up  said he traveled at least once a month to San Francisco and San Jose  Calif  He said he alternated between Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines   I have to go to a different terminal  check in on different machines  go to a different gate  go through T S A  on a different line   he wrote in an email  referring to Transportation Security Administration checkpoints  Traveling from Paine Field  he said  might be more efficient The Private Suite  which opened at Los Angeles International Airport in 2017 and is owned and operated by Gavin de Becker and Associates  a private security company  offers a less egalitarian  membership based approach ImageAs governments pull back from spending on infrastructure  private companies are moving into airports big and small  paying for private terminals with new types of services as well as joining local agencies in renovating existing terminalsCreditPropeller AirportsFor an annual  fee of  4 500  with additional charges for each flight  a member and up to three immediate relatives have access to a private lounge  an on call physician  complimentary manicures and massages  free meals and valet parking and other perks  There is a dedicated T S A  security line and a separate area for clearing customs  Passengers are chauffeured directly to their aircraft along the tarmac in a BMW 7 sedan Since May  United Airlines passengers have also been able to use the service  although the prices are different  We don t pay attention to what price ticket you buy   said Anthony Toth  managing director of digital sales for United Airlines  The service is open to any United Airlines passenger departing from Los Angeles at a cost of  375 for domestic flights and  500 for international flights  Private Suite expedites the checking of bags  accepting them up to 45 minutes before domestic flights and an hour before international flights Private Suite expects to generate more than  35 million dollars for Los Angeles World Airports  which operates Los Angeles International  during its 10 year lease   Our service improves security and congestion for all of LAX s passengers  and it s fully funded by those who create the most congestion issues  high risk travelers   said Amina Belouizdad  Private Suite s chief commercial officer At Denver International Airport  construction began in July at Jeppesen Terminal  where the Spanish company Ferrovial is working with JLC Infrastructure and Saunders Concessions on various upgrades  including improved security and new shopping and dining options  The consortium expects to choose  oversee and maintain the terminal s roughly 50 stores and restaurants  for three decades The arrangement allows the airport  to shift the risk for cost and schedule for the very complicated construction  to the public private partnership  Alex Renteria  an airport spokeswoman  said in an email Eliot Lees  vice president and managing director of aviation for ICF  a professional consulting  technology and marketing firm  said that attracting new air service was a major priority for airports  That might mean extra revenue for airports from additional flights and an increase in spending by passengers Still  private terminals require the same level of maintenance as their publicly owned counterparts  Passengers at Terminal 4 at Kennedy Airport discovered that in January 2018 after a snowstorm caused bottlenecks and delayed flights  A water main break at the terminal prolonged the recovery Roel Huinink  the president and chief executive of the Schiphol Group subsidiary that owns the terminal  said the water main had been repaired  The terminal also did a full risk analysis to make sure the problem did not reoccur  Mr  Huinink said Still  a private terminal cannot expect a public bailout if things do not work out financially  And because it is so difficult to leave and re enter the concourse  a passenger is hostage to the airport and whoever is running it  said Mr  Harteveldt  the industry analyst 
BEAUREGARD  Ala    As search and rescue workers raced on Monday to help the rural Alabama communities that had been ravaged by tornadoes  officials said that at least three children were among the 23 people killed by the storms Houses lay shredded and entire neighborhoods flattened in the wake of Sunday s storms in Lee County  Ala   where the deaths occurred  Sheriff Jay Jones of Lee County said it was as if someone  took a giant knife and just scraped the ground  Read  As Tornadoes Roared Across Alabama   There Wasn t Even Time to Be Afraid Sheriff Jones said that several people were still unaccounted for  and that crews were sorting through the debris in hopes of finding survivors Bill Harris  the Lee County coroner  said the three children among the dead were a 6 year old  a 9 year old who died at the hospital and a 10 year old  He said he had been told that in at least one case multiple members of the same family had died Here are the latest developments   Sheriff Jones said on Monday afternoon that the death toll remained at 23  with no new victims found since Sunday    Several people   a number in the double digits   were still unaccounted for  he said  without giving the exact figure   Dozens of people were sent to hospitals on Sunday with injuries  with at least two in intensive care   The National Weather Service said Monday that it believed the tornado that raced through Lee County had been an EF 4 storm  with winds of 170 miles an hour   Chris Darden  the meteorologist in charge for the weather service s Birmingham office  said the track of the  monster tornado  appeared to have been at least 24 miles long  and that the storm had been nearly a mile wide   Gov  Kay Ivey of Alabama said she had spoken with President Trump and received assurances of federal support A 10 year old girl is among the victimsTaylor Thornton  10  had been camping with her best friend for several days and was at the friend s father s mobile home in Beauregard when the storm hit on Sunday Taylor s mother  Ashley Thornton  said in a telephone interview that she got a call around 2 p m  Sunday from the friend s mother  who is divorced from the father  The mother had had no luck reaching the father by phone  could Ms  Thornton try When she couldn t get through either  her husband  David Thornton  drove toward the home  and then got out and walked when snapped trees blocked the way  When he arrived   there was no house left   he told his wife by phone  he recognized the place only by a motorcycle parked outside Ms  Thornton said her husband persuaded a sheriff s deputy to let him onto the property  where he saw Taylor s body  The deputy let him carry her to a waiting vehicle  The few times I ve talked to him  all he s told me was that she looked like she was sleeping   Ms  Thornton said  When the identity of the body was confirmed  she said  family and friends  just kind of crumbled  As of Monday afternoon  Ms  Thornton said  she had not been told exactly how Taylor died  other than that  the tornado had gone through and destroyed everything  Ms  Thornton said her daughter was a smiling  well behaved girl who loved horses and God and spending time with her best friend   Just the sweetest  kindest little thing in the whole world   she said The friend was injured in the storm but survived  Ms  Thornton said  the friend s father and one of his friends were killed Alabama Tornado Among the Region s Worst in 30 YearsSunday s tornadoes near Beauregard struck an area that rarely sees such strong storms Mr  Thornton  she said   is still trying to process this   he s having a hard time right now  The search for survivors continuesSheriff Jones said on Monday afternoon that search and rescue teams were not yet finished sweeping the hardest hit area  a square mile of land in Beauregard  an unincorporated community of 8 000 to 10 000 people south of Opelika More than 100 people had joined the search  supported by drones with infrared sensors that can detect heat signatures of trapped survivors  Most of the residences in the area are mobile or manufactured homes  and dozens had been destroyed  Some debris appeared to have been thrown more than a half mile by the winds  the sheriff said Kathrine Carson  the emergency management director for Lee County  said the tornado was  the worst natural disaster that has ever occurred in Lee County  Mr  Darden  the meteorologist  said that the tornado was the deadliest in the United States since 2013  when a tornado in Moore  Okla   killed 24 people Mr  Harris  the Lee County coroner  said it would be necessary to fingerprint six of the victims in Alabama to identify them  It s been a long  long night   Mr  Harris said   These families  some of them have lost just about the entire family  Apart from the EF 4 storm in Lee County  the Weather Service also assessed two other tornado tracks to the south in Macon County and Barbour County  Ala   and rated the tornadoes that touched down there as EF 1 storms  with wind speeds of at least 86 miles an hour A family huddled together to ride out the stormAs the tornado pulverized the small brick house in Opelika in which three generations of Evony Lashawn Wilson s family cowered together in a bathroom  Ms  Wilson s 15 year old son looked at her and said   Mom  I don t want to die  Ms  Wilson said that her son  Qumran  had long feared the weather  growing up in the shadow of the tornadoes that killed more than 230 people across Alabama in 2011  Now  his nightmares were coming true ImageDamage in Beauregard  Ala   on Monday after a tornado touched down the day before CreditAudra Melton for The New York TimesThe tornado stripped away their roof  The bathroom walls collapsed around Ms  Wilson  44  her son  husband and her 72 year old mother  The wind crushed them against one another  When Ms  Wilson looked up  she saw trees and debris swirling overhead Her husband urged their son to hang on  Ms  Wilson pushed Qumran s head down and told him to keep praying  Just the sound   it was something you never forget   Ms  Wilson said in a telephone interview on Monday morning   You could hear everything coming apart  When the tornado passed  Ms  Wilson s son and husband managed to wriggle out of the debris and went to look for help through their neighborhood of trailer homes and one story houses that had been all but reduced to pulp  Ms  Wilson stayed behind with her mother  who has severe health problems and cannot walk far As they huddled in the wreckage of the bathroom  now exposed to the elements  Ms  Wilson s phone buzzed with another tornado alert  She lay across her mother on the floor and tried to shelter both of them with a fallen bathroom cabinet as another wave of wind roared over them Ms  Wilson s mother fractured her hip in the storm  and Ms  Wilson fractured her ankle  The brick house  which had belonged to Ms  Wilson s mother  was destroyed  and so was the mobile home next door  where Ms  Wilson and her family lived There were more tornado deaths on Sunday than in all of 2018There has been a relative lull in deadly tornadoes in the United States lately  especially in 2018  when only nine deadly tornadoes were reported  causing 10 deaths  A more typical year might see 15 to 20 deadly tornadoes  according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration statistics Contrast that with 2011  the most ferocious year for tornadoes in decades  when 59 deadly storms claimed 553 lives  Nearly all struck in a three month period from late February to late May  including one tornado in Missouri that left 158 people dead  Science writers for The New York Times answered questions about why that season had been so brutal  and other facts and fictions about tornadoes After the 2011 outbreak  which killed more than 230 people in Alabama alone  some communities ordered upgrades to storm shelters  and residents became extraordinarily sensitive about even the threat of poor weather ImageA piece of metal wrapped around a tree in Beauregard CreditSocial Media ReutersTornadoes can strike nearly anywhere in the country when conditions are right  but they are most common in the southern Plains and the South  especially in a broad area called Dixie Alley stretching from Kansas and Oklahoma to Georgia Sunday s weather was a  fairly classic  pattern for March  where colder air mixes with warmer air  said James Spann  the chief meteorologist for WBMA television  the local ABC affiliate  This is clearly the biggest loss of life we ve had in my state in a while   he said   In fact  we had more deaths in Lee County  Ala   today than the entire United States last year  The Places in the U S  Where Disaster Strikes Again and AgainIn the last 16 years  most of the damages caused by catastrophes like wildfires and hurricanes have been concentrated in just a few areas An outpouring of help as a church prepares for evacueesScores of volunteers converged on Providence Baptist Church in Opelika on Monday and began sorting supplies  which were soon stacked high on folding tables There were piles of clothes and pyramids of blankets  Beneath one table  a cardboard box held Ziploc bags of essentials  toilet paper  toothpaste  soap and the like  Cases of bottled water lined one wall  This is how things work in

What WAS Said President Obama  from what they tell me  was under a similar kind of a thing  didn t give one letter  They didn t do anything  They didn t give one letter of the request  Many requests were made  They didn t give a letter    President Trump  at the White House on TuesdayFalse Republicans took control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections and opened a number of investigations into the Obama administration  While Mr  Obama did invoke executive privilege in at least one instance  Mr  Trump is wrong that his predecessor did not turn over any documents at all One of the first controversies that drew scrutiny from Republicans in Congress was Operation Fast and Furious  a botched federal gun trafficking case  Mr  Trump may have been referring to Mr  Obama s assertion of executive privilege over some 1 300 pages of documents related to the case  A federal judge ruled against the Obama administration in 2016  Beyond the batch of documents covered by the court ruling  congressional investigators obtained more than 10 000 pages of additional material  including nearly 7 000 from the Justice Department after subpoenas From February 2011 to August 2012  a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee investigated Solyndra  a solar power company that received  527 million in government loans and declared bankruptcy  The final report faulted the Obama administration for delaying the document gathering process  but still obtained over 300 000 pages of documents from the White House  federal agencies and Solyndra and its counsel Congress opened more than half a dozen investigations into the State Department s handling of the attacks on American facilities in Benghazi  Libya  on Sept  11  2012  The House Select Committee on Benghazi  which conducted the longest lasting inquiry  said in its December 2016 final report that it began with 50 000 pages of documents   though it said half of them were useless   and obtained an additional 75 000 pages of new material  including 1 450 pages from the White House The House Oversight Committee and the Senate Finance Committee both looked into claims that the Internal Revenue Service improperly targeted conservative groups seeking tax exempt status  A bipartisan report from the Senate committee  released in 2015  said that the White House provided a  limited number of documents  sent to or from the I R S  official at the center of the inquiry  Lois Lerner  while the tax agency provided 1 3 million pages of material None of those inquiries scrutinized Mr  Obama s personal finances or business interests  as Democrats have sought to do with their document request targeting Mr  Trump  But unlike Mr  Trump  Mr  Obama had voluntarily released his tax returns  And Mr  Obama did not have business holdings that raised possible conflict of interest issues Curious about the accuracy of a claim  Email factcheck nytimes com  
WILMINGTON  Del    Tom Vari s lighting suppliers began mailing him warnings about tariffs last fall  They varied a bit in dates and percentages  but they all said the same thing  Very soon  your prices are going up Mr  Vari owns Brandywine Lighting Gallery  a 2 000 square foot independent showroom on a busy highway north of Wilmington  Almost everything he sells is made in China  meaning that since September  his products have been subject to a 10 percent tax on Chinese imports levied by the Trump administration  So far  Mr  Vari has largely absorbed those costs  by accepting lower profits  But he   and his suppliers   say they won t be able to shield customers from dramatic price increases much longer President Trump insists that his trade war will make America better off and that until it s resolved  China is paying billions of dollars in tariffs to the United States  But it is small business owners like Mr  Vari  and his customers  who are largely footing the bill for Mr  Trump s tariffs  As the trade war reaches into its second year  companies and consumers across the United States are growing weary  Small businesses like Brandywine Lighting have been forced to adapt to new economic realities brought about by Mr  Trump s trade fight with China  Europe  Canada and Mexico and those companies are now beginning to chafe as the fight drags on  putting their profitability at risk The United States and China are moving closer to a deal that would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific  while requiring the Chinese to buy more American goods and make some changes to its trade practices  While details are still being discussed  the agreement does not appear to require the sweeping changes to China s economy that prompted Mr  Trump to begin the trade war For Mr  Vari  a resolution could not come soon enough  If no deal is reached  he is worried that he will be priced out of the market by bigger competitors who can more easily absorb the tariffs costs and not pass them along to customers  I have to make a decision  if I am going to raise my prices  or I m going to hold my prices  so people realize I m trying to help them   Mr  Vari said   Help only goes so far  when you re a mom and pop store like this  Mr  Trump initially imposed tariffs on  50 billion in Chinese imports last spring  in retaliation for trade practices that Mr  Trump said hurt American jobs and industries  He added tariffs on an additional  200 billion worth of goods in late September  including on many home goods such as lighting supplies  The president initially threatened to raise tariffs on that second tranche to 25 percent from 10 percent on March 2  but much to Mr  Vari s relief  the president agreed last month to delay that increase  citing progress in the talks So far  the tariffs on Chinese goods have yet to translate into large price increases across the United States economy  Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimated  that China tariffs have added 0 1 percent to inflation for consumers and 0 3 percent for business investment goods But there are signs that the tariffs have raised prices for Americans who buy imported lighting  The Labor Department reports monthly inflation statistics for  clocks  lamps and decorator items  in the United States  Like many consumer goods  those items have experienced steady deflation over the last decade   meaning they re either getting cheaper  or they are improving in value  or both  From 2008 to 2018  the Consumer Price Index for those goods fell by an average of 6 percent a year That trend reversed once tariffs took effect  From September of 2018 to January this year  the price index rose by 2 7 percent A much sharper increase could be on the way  if the letters from Mr  Vari s suppliers are an indication ImageMany of the products at Brandywine Lighting Gallery are imported from China  Since September  those imports have been subject to a 10 percent tariff CreditRyan Collerd for The New York TimesHe has been collecting them for months here at his store  which employs four full timers and one part timer  The showroom is packed with hundreds of chandeliers  floor lamps  bath fixtures  bed fixtures and glowing guides for outdoor walkways  There is no warehouse attached  which means he stocks one  maybe two  of everything customers see here  He has stacks of catalogs they can order from if they d like more options In an industry increasingly dominated by online retailers and big box stores  Brandywine s business model is customer service  Employees here will spend hours  if needed  helping customers decide on the right fixture  Those on the fence can take a light home to try it out  no obligation to buy Still  Mr  Vari must keep his prices competitive   and his margins healthy enough to pay his bills  That s why the letters from suppliers concerned him this fall   Price increase announcement   one read  explaining that the September wave of tariffs would push up costs of several brands by 6 percent   I can only hope that the trade war ceases before another 15 percent tariff increase goes into effect   another said  Some of his invoices began breaking out a  tariff per unit  so Mr  Vari could see what the trade war was already costing him In the early letters  suppliers said they were absorbing some of the tariff costs themselves  But they have increasingly warned store owners to stock up on inventory ahead of any further escalation  which the letters say will be almost entirely passed on as price increases  Big box retailers have the money and the shelf space to stock up  Mr  Vari does not He has shielded some  but not all  customers from price increases so far  The decision is all about margins  Mr  Vari said he couldn t afford to absorb tariff costs on everyday home lighting  where industry competition is higher and profit margins are already low  Their prices have risen in his showroom  so that every sale does not actually cost him money Mr  Vari s bigger margins come from large scale lighting projects  like kitchen renovations and landscaping  He has not raised prices there yet  because he does not want to drive away customers  viewing it as a trade off between lower profits today for a larger clientele in the long run  If the tariffs rise again  however  he will have to raise those prices  We ll still be O K    Mr  Vari said   because I won t be a pig about it  But he worries  he said  about  customers never pulling the trigger  if a large project suddenly costs  1 000 more than it would have Mr  Vari has been in the lighting business  in one way or another  for 40 years  He recalls when a large share of the products he sold were made in the United States  That was the 1980s  before the industry migrated to China What is left of the domestic lighting industry today  he said  is so high end that he cannot afford to stock it   Great products   Mr  Vari said   But the whole idea of bringing the industry back here  That s what it will be  High paid people  High paid producers  And only the rich will be able to afford them  Mr  Trump s promises to bring that type of manufacturing back to the United States are  political bullcrap   Mr  Vari said   Some people believe that just because Trump s pressuring China  we re going to be an industrial powerhouse again  It s not going to happen  Mr  Vari recently warned customers about the impact of tariffs in a social media post  where he said Mr  Trump s actions were going to make lighting more expensive  It drew immediate criticism from Mr  Trump s supporters   The haters came like that   Mr  Vari said   I ll never do a post like that again  Instead  he is spreading the word about price increases in traditional small business fashion  owner to customer  one person at a time 
Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  Larry Hogan is a guy who has spent a whole lot of time talking about running for president But none of it  he says  is his idea In recent weeks  Mr  Hogan  the Republican governor of deeply blue Maryland  has become the avatar of the G O P  s  Never Trump  faction  carefully positioning himself as the reluctant savior ready to step in for his party should a big bombshell drop Mr  Hogan is a popular politician with an interesting   and perhaps prescient   personal story  His father  as a member of the House Judiciary Committee  was the very first Republican to come out for President Richard M  Nixon s impeachment  and was the only congressional Republican to vote for all three articles of impeachment Mr  Hogan says he had never given much thought to being president before he was approached by prominent Trump critics like William Kristol  a leader of the motley crew of moderate Republicans  libertarians and foreign policy hawks who make up the Never Trump movement   No interest  no thought  no desire  no plans   he told me and my colleague Alex Burns in an interview last week  I guess I just left the door open  saying   You never say never    he said   I don t know what s going to happen in the next several months  He was in Iowa today for a National Governors Association event  A trip to New Hampshire later this spring is being considered Mr  Hogan is right  A lot can happen in the next few months  particularly given the news today that the House Judiciary Committee requested documents from 81 agencies  individuals and companies tied to the president  including his sons and son in law  Jared Kushner Former Gov  John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have talked about challenging the president  and at least one potential opponent is nearly in the race already   former Gov  William F  Weld of Massachusetts  who started  an exploratory committee last month But there are a few key facts to remember when you hear Republicans floating the idea 1  No sitting president in the modern era has been successfully unseated in a primary 2  Mr  Trump is still really  really popular among Republicans  An NBC News Wall Street Journal poll released over the weekend found that nearly 90 percent of Republicans approve of the president 3  Despite the best efforts of the Never Trump movement  the party establishment   the national committee  members of Congress and party activists   is firmly behind Mr  Trump  They have the right to jump in and lose  They ll lose horribly   said the Republican National Committee chairwoman  Ronna Romney McDaniel  at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference this past weekend   Have at it  Go ahead  Waste your money  waste your time and go ahead and lose  That s not to say a primary race would have no effect on Mr  Trump  Strong primary challenges contributed to the general election defeats of Presidents Gerald Ford  Jimmy Carter and George Bush But a strong challenge   meaning one that has a chance of actual success   is pretty unlikely Irrespective of the president  both Mr  Hogan and Mr  Weld would most likely face a serious uphill climb to win over Republican voters  given their differences with much of the base  Mr  Kasich failed to win any state but his own when he ran for president in 2016 as a more moderate voice In our interview  Mr  Hogan criticized Republicans in Congress for having tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act without proposing a suitable alternative  He said that he believed Roe v  Wade  which made abortion legal nationwide  had been correctly decided  And he declined to express any personal view of whether the Senate had been right to confirm Justice Brett M  Kavanaugh  a vote that awarded Republicans control of the Supreme Court for a generation For his part  Mr  Hogan  a popular governor who won with cross party support  says he fears the current administration is  shrinking  the party s base  leaving Republicans at a serious disadvantage in their efforts to  reach a wider audience and to not alienate people and not to be as divisive  He may be right  But that s not an argument likely to win over Republican voters Just ask Mr  Kasich                     Drop us a line ImageWe want to hear

WASHINGTON   President Trump has decided to strip India of a special status that exempts billions of dollars worth of Indian exports from American tariffs  raising new trade tensions with the world s second most populous country The Office of the United States Trade Representative said on Monday night that  India and Turkey would no longer be eligible for preferential market access to the United States  While the decision to terminate Turkey s status stemmed from that country s economic development  the move against India was retaliatory  It came after a year of failed efforts by the Trump administration to compel India to lower its trade barriers  including the tariffs it charges on American goods Mr  Trump s decision to confront India over its trade practices ratchets up trade tensions at a moment when the administration has been trying to ease frictions with China  which have rattled global financial markets and unsettled businesses But India s high tariff rates have been a major source of frustration for Mr  Trump  who has repeatedly assailed India for charging steep tariffs on American motorcycles  The president routinely criticizes India s  unfair  trade practices and highlighted the disparity between how the United States and India treat imports in sharply worded remarks during last weekend s Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington  India is a very  very high tariff nation  and they charge tremendous  tremendous numbers   Mr  Trump said  adding that he wanted to impose a  reciprocal tax  on India Mr  Trump frequently cites Harley Davidson when complaining about India s trade practices  criticizing the country for charging 50 percent duties on Harleys and other motorcycles  While Harley Davidson does sell motorcycles in India  it has moved much of that production abroad to avoid tariffs and has opened a factory outside New Delhi  Most of the 3 000 Harleys sold in India last year avoided the tariffs Beyond motorcycles  India has angered American medical device makers with price caps on items such as cardiac stents and knee implants  New policies restricting Visa  Mastercard and American Express also kicked in last year  and Walmart and Amazon have been upset about the new e commerce policies recently imposed in India The United States and India engaged in  126 2 billion worth of trade in 2017  according to United States trade representative  with the United States running a goods and services deficit of  27 3 billion  About  5 billion of Indian exports to the United States were eligible for reduced tariffs under the Generalized System of Preferences program  or G S P  According to India s Ministry of Commerce and Industry  the program has allowed for  190 million per year in duty reduction  It s survivable  but painful nonetheless   said Richard Rossow  an expert in United States India relations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Mr  Rossow noted that the tariffs could be enough to encourage American importers to buy some products from Mexico or Vietnam instead of India  The program covered imports of items such as automobile parts  agricultural products  jewelry and handicrafts For its part  India has been upset by the steel and aluminum tariffs that the United States imposed last year as well as restrictions on H 1B visas for foreign workers and spouses of H 1B visa holders The Trump administration initiated a review of India s preferential trade status in 2018  and in recent months there have been increasing signs that negotiations were going poorly  Last year  Robert Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  was expected to travel to India but ended up not going  In February Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  backed out of a planned trip and blamed bad weather Mr  Lighthizer s office said this week that  despite  intensive engagement   India had failed to take the necessary steps to keep its tariff exemptions  The United States has been particularly concerned about market access for dairy and medical devices  India has implemented a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on United States commerce   the agency said in a statement India pushed back against such accusations on Tuesday  arguing that it was willing to work with the United States but that some of the demands were unreasonable  India was able to offer a very meaningful way forward on almost all the U S  requests   the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement   In a few instances  specific U S  requests were not found reasonable and doable at this time by the departments concerned  in light of public welfare concerns reflective of India s developing country status and its national interest  The change to India s trade status will take place in 60 days  Lawmakers and business groups expressed hope on Tuesday that a deal could still be worked out  The Indian government hasn t engaged enough to address market access issues   said Senator Charles E  Grassley of Iowa  the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee   For the sake of the many Americans and Indians who relied on G S P  benefits  I hope that India will work to quickly address these legitimate concerns  
WASHINGTON   America s trade deficit in goods with the rest of the world rose to its highest level in history last year as the United States imported a record number of products  including from China  widening the deficit to  891 3 billion and delivering a setback to President Trump s goal of narrowing that gap The increase was driven by some factors outside Mr  Trump s control  like a global economic slowdown and the relative strength of the United States dollar  both of which weakened overseas demand for American goods  But the widening gap was also exacerbated by Mr  Trump s  1 5 trillion tax cut  which has been largely financed by government borrowing  and the trade war he escalated last year It is a case of textbook economics catching up with some of Mr  Trump s unorthodox economic policies  Economists have long warned that Mr  Trump s tax cuts would ultimately exacerbate a trade deficit he has vowed to reduce  as Americans  flush with extra cash  bought more imported goods His trade war with Beijing also widened the gap  Stiff tariffs on Chinese goods helped slow China s economy  crimping American exports  which declined nearly 50 percent in December from the same month a year before  All countries run trade deficits whenever they consume more than they produce   said Kimberly Clausing  an economist at Reed College in Oregon   And when we borrow to finance tax cuts  like we did with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  we make these imbalances worse  The trade deficit is the difference between how much a country sells to its trading partners and how much it buys  It generally includes both goods and services  though Mr  Trump has focused almost exclusively on the deficit in goods  He has long boasted that his trade policies would reduce that gap  which he views as a measure of whether partners like China and the European Union are taking advantage of the United States  a diagnosis few economists share Instead  in a year in which Mr  Trump imposed tariffs on steel  aluminum  washing machines  solar panels and a variety of Chinese goods  the overall trade deficit grew 12 5 percent from 2017  or nearly  70 billion  to  621 billion  the Commerce Department said Wednesday  Although the United States recorded a trade surplus in services  the trade deficit in goods with the European Union and Mexico grew more than 10 percent as imports rose faster than exports In December  the overall deficit in goods and services  which includes everything from computers and washing machines to tourism and intellectual property  rose 19 percent from the previous month  to  59 8 billion  It was the highest monthly trade deficit since 2008  when the American economy was mired in recession Several global economic factors explain the widening of the deficit last year  China s slowdown has reduced consumer appetite for American goods  as has slowing growth in Europe  The strength of the dollar in global currency markets has made it cheaper for American consumers to buy foreign made goods  and more difficult for foreign customers to buy American made ones That helped fuel a record number of Chinese goods imported into the United States  The trade gap in goods between the United States and China hit  419 billion in 2018  deepening a bilateral deficit that has been a particular source of anger for Mr  Trump         g trade deficits box  g artboard

seasonally adjusted   Source  The United States Bureau of Economic AnalysisBy The New York TimesWhile Mr  Trump sees the trade deficit as a sort of economic scorecard for which country is on top  most economists disagree with this perspective  viewing trade deficits not as a sign of economic strength or weakness  but as a function of macroeconomic factors like investment flows  fluctuations in the value of currency and relative growth rates And as the trade deficit widens  Mr  Trump s focus on it has resulted in a particular irony  By his own metric  the president is failing to right America s global trading relationships  Yet many of the president s critics do not blame him for this  saying some fluctuations in the trade deficit are largely beyond his control  The stronger trade deficit in the short run is telling you we re importing more  so it s not a particular alarming development   said Lawrence H  Summers  a Harvard economist who directed the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama   The president notwithstanding  I d rather live in a country that capital is trying to get into  rather than get out of  The reason we have a trade deficit is people are investing in America  Mr  Trump has aimed tariffs at China  Europe  Canada and Mexico to help reset the trade balance with other countries that he says engage in unfair practices to gain a competitive edge in global trade That is particularly true with China  which Mr  Trump and many business groups say tilts the balance of power by providing state subsidies  blocking foreign competition and engaging in other tactics  His top advisers are pressing Beijing to commit to a specific target for reducing the bilateral trade imbalance between the countries  While the Chinese have offered to make large purchases of American products  including soybeans and liquefied natural gas  they have resisted setting a specific dollar target for the trade balance  arguing that such a metric is largely beyond their control In a congressional hearing last week  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  held up a chart that showed a steadily rising trade deficit with China  Also marked on the chart were various negotiations past administrations had held with China  which Mr  Lighthizer said had failed to stem the deficit s rise  He called the deficit with China  along with China s unfair trade practices   major threats to our economy  The value of China s currency  which is determined partly by the market and partly by the government  weakened against the dollar last year  blunting the effect of Mr  Trump s tariffs by making Chinese goods even cheaper  The currency began rising again in the fall  as President Xi Jinping of China met Mr  Trump in Argentina late last year to begin hammering out a trade pact  said Brad Setser  a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations  China certainly allowed the market to push the value of the yuan down against the dollar over the summer   Mr  Setser said As part of the trade deal in the works  the United States has secured a commitment from Beijing not to artificially weaken its currency  according to administration officials The relative strength of the United States economy is also a large factor in the widening deficit  along with the  1 5 trillion tax cut Mr  Trump signed in 2017  which accelerated growth last year Money from the tax cuts helped Americans buy more imported goods than ever in 2018  And to finance the tax cuts  the government needed to borrow more dollars  some of which came from foreign investors  Foreigners primarily get those dollars by selling more goods and services to Americans  which will necessarily widen the trade gap  an effect that many economists predicted at the time Mr  Trump signed the tax cuts The tax cuts are also helping to swell the federal budget deficit  which Mr  Trump similarly pledged to reduce   and  in fact  eliminate   as a candidate  On Tuesday  Treasury Department figures showed the budget deficit widening  and it is on track to top  1 trillion this fiscal year  Revenue from personal and corporate income taxes was down by 9 percent in January  compared with the same month a year ago As with the trade deficit  many economists are growing less alarmed by the budget deficit than in previous years  However  Federal Reserve officials and some economists warn that federal borrowing is growing too quickly and will ultimately swamp the American economy  with the United States paying huge sums of interest on the debt  diverting funds from social safety net programs like Medicare and Social Security  The Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  warned lawmakers at a House hearing last week that the federal debt was on an  unsustainable  path Mr  Powell was asked during the hearing if he would also say that the trade deficit was unsustainable   I don t think I would say that   he replied

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Wednesday weakened a rule that required the government to annually make public its estimates of civilian bystanders killed in airstrikes outside conventional war zones   increasing the secrecy that cloaks one of the most contentious aspects of the fight against terrorists In an executive order  Mr  Trump revoked a disclosure requirement that President Barack Obama  imposed in July 2016  The change was the latest in a series of ways that Mr  Trump has dismantled the architecture that Mr  Obama built over time to constrain the use of drone strikes and commando raids targeting Islamist militants in places like tribal Pakistan and rural Yemen But Mr  Trump s executive order noted that since 2016  Congress has enacted a law that separately requires the Pentagon to issue annual reports about bystander deaths from all of its operations  including in conventional war zones like Afghanistan and Syria Citing that law  the National Security Council said in a statement that the Obama era rule amounted to  superfluous reporting requirements  requirements that do not improve government transparency  but rather distract our intelligence professionals from their primary mission  Still  the law requiring disclosure of bystander deaths covers only the Defense Department s operations  It does not extend to airstrikes by the C I A   which has carried out its own drone campaign targeting terrorism suspects in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen Rita Siemion  the international legal counsel at Human Rights First  a nonprofit advocacy group  criticized the Trump administration s move  It s a major step backwards that s out of touch with what the D O D  is doing and what Congress has been focused on   she said  referring to the Defense Department The revocation of the disclosure rule joins other steps Mr  Trump has taken since becoming president to dismantle constraints Mr  Obama had imposed on counterterrorism operations Soon after taking office  Mr  Trump quietly deemed large sections of Yemen and Somalia to be  areas of active hostilities  subject to war zone rules  In battle  it can be lawful to carry out a strike at a military target  knowing that some nearby civilians may die  so long as the collateral damage is deemed to be necessary and proportionate And later in 2017  Mr  Trump rescinded a set of rules  known as the Presidential Policy Guidance  that the Obama administration had imposed on counterterrorism operations away from hot battlefields  Those limits included a requirement that targets of kill missions by the military and the C I A  be limited to high level militants rather than foot soldier jihadists without any special training or leadership role  and a requirement for high level  interagency vetting of proposed attacks Still  Mr  Trump s changes in 2017 left in place a requirement that strikes away from conventional war zones take place only when military officers had  near certainty  that no civilians would be killed  Similarly  his executive order on Wednesday left in place other aspects of Mr  Obama s directive that require the government to make a priority of preventing civilian casualties  The United States government is fully committed to complying with its obligations under the law of armed conflict  minimizing  to the greatest extent possible  civilian casualties  and acknowledging responsibility when they unfortunately occur during military operations   the National Security Council statement said In a sense  Mr  Trump s revocation of the disclosure rule amounted to a belated acknowledgment that his administration had already changed the Obama policy in practice  The director of national intelligence never put out a report about bystander casualties in 2017  even though the Obama era order requiring one remained on the books last year  when the report was due out Several other factors somewhat lowered the stakes of Mr  Trump s move  First  the C I A  appears to be carrying out fewer drone strikes than it did during the height of the Obama administration s counterterrorism operations The last drone strike was reported more than a year ago in the tribal area of Pakistan  where the C I A  took the lead in handling airstrikes  according to Bill Roggio  a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies  who has tracked airstrikes for more than a decade on his Long War Journal  While Yemen is still being bombed  it is hard to determine whether the American government or the Saudi Emirati coalition battling the Houthis  an Iran allied rebel faction  are conducting the strikes  he said Moreover  even when the Obama administration revealed the official assessment of how many civilians had died  those numbers were merely a vague range and lower than estimates by outsiders like the Long War Journal  the Washington based security policy organization New America and the London based Bureau of Investigative Journalism The Obama administration estimated that from its start in 2009 until mid 2016  64 to 116 civilian bystanders were killed in such strikes  Outside groups  estimates ranged from roughly 200 to 800  But because the official statistics did not break numbers down by location and date  it was difficult to make sense of the discrepancy  I think we will never truly know the number of civilians killed in airstrikes in these areas away from active battlefields   Mr  Roggio said   The reality is that these strikes take place where the government  news organizations and human rights groups have limited visibility  and the enemy has shown a propensity to attempt to manipulate the information  Joshua Geltzer  who served as the senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council from 2015 to 2017  acknowledged that the disclosure rule did not go as far as human rights groups wanted  But he said it was nevertheless a major step forward whose loss may create security risks  not just increase secrecy  This is a bad move not just for transparency  but also for those who believe that tools like drone strikes need to remain available to the government for countering terrorism   he said   The continued availability of that tool rests in part in confidence in how it is being used  and this was an important step in giving the public some insight into that  
The Democratic National Committee said on Wednesday that it had barred Fox News from hosting or televising a candidate debate for the party s 2020 primary election  an unusually pointed rebuke of a cable news channel whose star pundits are closely aligned with President Trump The committee s chairman  Tom Perez  said in a statement that Fox News  is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates   Mr  Perez cited an article published this week by The New Yorker that reported on ties between the president and the network  which he deemed an  inappropriate relationship  Fox News  which devotes its prime time hours to pro Trump commentary  was seen in broadcast circles as a long shot to sponsor a gathering of Democratic candidates  But the network had made an aggressive pitch to party officials  noting  for instance  that the  Fox News Sunday  anchor  Chris Wallace  had won plaudits after moderating the third general election debate in 2016  We hope the D N C  will reconsider its decision to bar Chris Wallace  Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum  all of whom embody the ultimate journalistic integrity and professionalism  from moderating a Democratic presidential debate   Bill Sammon  managing editor of Fox News s Washington bureau  said in a statement   They offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest TV news audience in America  which includes many persuadable voters  Mr  Trump weighed in Wednesday evening  sarcastically praising the Democrats  decision   Good  then I think I ll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates   he wrote on Twitter The president often tweets idle threats  But his message raised the prospect that Mr  Trump could boycott a debate in the 2020 race if he took issue with the network affiliation of a chosen moderator  General election debates are not sponsored by individual networks  they are overseen by an independent commission and typically aired on all major stations In early 2016  Mr  Trump did boycott a primary debate   which was sponsored by Fox News  He had objected to the inclusion of the anchor Megyn Kelly as a moderator Televised debates are a relatively new innovation in the presidential primary process  but they have become sought after events for networks eager to score high ratings and serve as gatekeepers in the early months of the nominating cycle  when viewers are forming their initial impressions of the candidates Democratic officials had signaled some openness to collaborating with Fox News on a debate in 2019 or 2020  saying they were trying to reach a broad national audience But the party came under pressure this week after the report in The New Yorker  by the veteran journalist Jane Mayer  which laid out the sometimes symbiotic relationship between Mr  Trump and the network he follows closely Network stars like Sean Hannity regularly advise the president  and Mr  Hannity spoke at a Trump campaign rally last year  high fiving the president s deputy chief of staff  Bill Shine  himself a former Fox News president  Other Fox News alumni  like Heather Nauert and Kimberly Guilfoyle  have joined the administration or Mr  Trump s inner circle Ms  Mayer stated that Fox News had buried a damaging story about Mr  Trump ahead of the 2016 election  the Fox executive involved said he blocked the reporting because he did not think it was journalistically sound  Ms  Mayer also cited unnamed sources who said they were told by a witness that Mr  Trump was fed questions ahead of a Fox sponsored primary debate in 2015  The network strongly denied that charge  and Ms  Kelly  who served as a debate moderator  has said she does not believe that her questions were leaked Mr  Perez said on Wednesday that Ms  Mayer s article  led me to conclude  that Fox News was not fit to sponsor an official candidate forum So far  the Democrats have announced two primary debates for their candidates  which will air in June on NBC News and in July on CNN  The decision to exclude Fox News was first reported by The Washington Post Executives at Fox News say they are open to sponsoring another televised town hall   albeit one without the imprimatur of the Democratic Party   in the coming months  The network is free to invite candidates to appear  and candidates are free to accept  Mr  Wallace  Mr  Baier and Ms  MacCallum have each interviewed Mr  Trump during his tenure Fox News did not sponsor a formal debate during the 2016 Democratic nominating process  but it did host a town hall featuring Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in March 2016  Mr  Baier served as moderator Relations between political parties and news networks are not always smooth  In 2016  Republican officials stripped a debate from NBC News after alleging that a previous event  conducted by the network s corporate sibling CNBC  was  petty and meanspirited in tone   according to the party s then chairman  Reince Priebus 
The Trump re election campaign s wireless open access proposal was a poorly vetted scheme possibly intended to score political points  It was squelched almost immediately after it became public  as shocked White House staff members complained that it contradicted the administration s support for competing wireless networks  The twist  Open access wireless is actually a terrific idea  Some forward thinking Democrats and public interest advocates have been pushing it for decades The concept  promoted by Republican operatives such as Newt Gingrich and Karl Rove  is for a network supporting fifth generation  5G  wireless technology to operate on a wholesale basis  Carriers such as AT T  Comcast and Verizon could buy capacity  So could anyone else  Apple  Amazon  Walmart  Uber or small operators serving rural areas  No company could use exclusive control over spectrum to block competition Last year  a leaked National Security Council presentation called for nationalization of 5G networks to improve cybersecurity and better compete against China  The proposal was ignominiously killed and its author left the White House  The Trump re election campaign s proposal wisely dropped the government takeover  It shifted the focus to wholesale access  which could be overseen by an independent nonprofit organization  like the independent system operators that manage electricity markets  Today s cellphones use fourth generation wireless technology  or 4G  5G  a set of standards under development  promises higher speeds  improved coverage and better support for new technologies such as augmented reality  autonomous vehicles and connected sensors in all types of devices  5G networks require denser construction of towers  reducing the distance between a tower and each device  To make 5G a reality  companies and consumers around the world will have to invest hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to upgrade hardware  phones and networks  The countries leading the way could reap huge economic benefits The December arrest in Canada of a top official of Huawei  China s biggest communications hardware provider  raised the stakes considerably  Meng Wanzhou is accused of committing fraud to help Huawei evade sanctions against Iran  The United States is pressuring its allies to ban Huawei from building their 5G networks on national security grounds Those moves will not  however  accelerate 5G deployment in the United States  The Chinese government aggressively coordinates and promotes 5G activity  which is proceeding at a breakneck pace  China Tower  for example  added 460 wireless tower sites per day in 2017  more than ten times the rate of American companies  according to a report by Deloitte relatedMore on 5GOpinion   Tim Wu

policymakers  which has been consistent through at least four administrations  is that competition among wireless operators is superior to heavy handed government initiatives  Nevermind that while American wireless providers have a strong track record on innovation  prices for consumers are high by global standards  and the so called free market is actually an oligopoly of four major carriers that could soon fall to three  Way back in 1995  a Columbia University economist  Eli Noam  proposed an alternative  a wholesale spectrum provider that sold capacity to all  Over the next few years  some progressives  myself included  argued that cable broadband networks should be subject to a similar open access mandate  And in 2010  as the Federal Communications Commission developed the National Broadband Plan  a team led by the Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler made a detailed case for wholesale sharing  The idea was shot down each time amid furious industry opposition  Why would the Trump campaign endorse open access  Rivada Networks  a politically connected firm that counts Peter Thiel  a prominent Trump donor  among its investors  appears to be positioning itself for the lucrative contract to provide the technology for such a system  Mr  Trump s political advisers see the open access plan as a way to improve wireless service in rural areas  a gift to the president s base These motivations should not obscure the value of open access  The communications industry has already shown that a competitive open market sometimes can t develop without government action  The F C C  had to prevent phone companies from squelching internet service providers  and many companies that develop online applications face potential blocking of their services and discrimination by broadband operators  The primary way the government makes wireless spectrum available today is through exclusive licensing to the highest bidder  That can make it difficult for companies that provide niche services such as telemedicine and smart electric grids  or that serve less populous areas  which the big national carriers often ignore Even some architects of the current system are reconsidering  Peter Cramton  for example  helped more than a dozen countries design spectrum auctions  He s now Rivada s chief economist  As Mr  Cramton and his co author  Linda Doyle  wrote in 2017  wholesale open access offers the best hope to break the wireless oligopoly while also using spectrum more efficiently They were right  Making capacity available in real time at market prices limits hoarding and encourages innovation  Unleashing our brilliant start up ecosystem through such market mechanisms  along with opportunities for unlicensed access to wireless capacity  is America s best hope to beat China in 5G But a poorly managed implementation could create a greedy wholesale monopolist  or turn wireless access into a political football  as is the disastrous fate of Australia s open access fiber network  And the details of implementation are not this administration s strong suit There is also no guarantee that rural wireless providers will rush in to take advantage of the opportunity  A wholesale system will require careful oversight and a long term commitment by the government  The political campaign s rapid walk back does not inspire confidence Nonetheless  tech savvy Democrats should welcome the embrace of their open access vision  Even if it means being more supportive of a Trump campaign position than the White House  Kevin Werbach  a professor at the

announced a wide ranging inquiry into  the alleged obstruction of justice  public corruption and other abuses of power by President Trump  his associates and members of his administration  Citing two years of  near daily attacks on our basic legal  ethical and constitutional rules and norms  by the president  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the committee s chairman  asserted that  while it was important to respect the continuing criminal investigations  Congress  cannot rely on others to do the investigative work for us   With Republican lawmakers having abdicated their oversight duties when they controlled the House  Mr  Nadler said  Democrats must now  begin building the public record  As its opening move  Mr  Nadler s committee has sent requests for documents to 81 individuals and entities associated with Mr  Trump  including Donald Trump Jr   Eric Trump  Jared Kushner  Jeff Sessions  Hope Hicks  Paul Manafort  Steve Bannon and Roger Stone  The now defunct Trump Foundation is on the list  as is the Trump Organization  the Trump campaign  the White House and the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee  Also  David Pecker  the president s close friend and chairman of the parent company of The National Enquirer Look for the next several months to be a nonstop pageant of subpoenas  hearings and court challenges Mr  Nadler s panel is not alone in looking to impose accountability on a devious and dishonest president  But his investigation is special in at least one regard  As students of Congress   or of presidential scandals   can tell you  the House Judiciary Committee is where impeachment proceedings are born  And the areas on which Mr  Nadler will focus   obstruction of justice  public corruption and abuse of power   are precisely the sorts of high crimes and misdemeanors on which such cases are built Not that Mr  Nadler is raring to impeach  Many Democrats worry that an attempt to remove the president could prompt a political backlash  and no one wants to repeat what happened in 1998  when House Republicans  obsessive pursuit of President Bill Clinton contributed to the party taking an electoral beating Even as he prepared to start this investigation  Mr  Nadler sought to tamp down expectations   Impeachment is a long way down the road   he said Sunday in an ABC News interview  Political investigations tend to be marathons rather than sprints  requiring the slow  meticulous accretion of evidential layers  It s easy to forget how slowly and painfully the Watergate investigation unfolded  It was more than a year after John Dean s congressional testimony that President Richard Nixon resigned  With his investigation  Mr  Nadler is looking to build a case for impeachment so compelling that it will have enough bipartisan support to survive the Republican controlled Senate  Barring that  his investigation will serve to keep the heat on Mr  Trump  and perhaps keep the Democratic base at least somewhat placated  as the next election approaches  Mr  Nadler is right to telegraph restraint  This weekend  Kevin McCarthy  the top Republican in the House  said of Mr  Nadler s inquiry   I think Congressman Nadler decided to impeach the president the day the president won the election  Mr  Trump cavalierly dismissed the sweeping document request at a White House luncheon with the North Dakota State Bison football team on Monday   I cooperate all the time with everybody   he said   You know the beautiful thing   no collusion  It s all a hoax  Saturday  in a two hour speech before the Conservative Political Action Conference  Mr  Trump offered a more pungent take on his tormentors  using a vulgarity to describe the special counsel inquiry and calling the investigations  collusion delusion  But his core message remains the same  The president is perfectly content to burn down the nation to save his own hide It is unclear what new crimes or abuses Mr  Nadler s investigation might reveal  No matter how determined  Democrats in Congress lag far behind both the special counsel s office and the prosecutors of the Southern District of New York  Yet the House still has a vital role to play in educating the public on the legal and ethical questions spiraling around this president And there is much to illuminate  despite Mr  Trump s repeated assertion that  absent hard evidence of his having directly colluded with Russia to subvert an American election  he can declare vindication  Just last week  in his testimony about Mr  Trump before the House Oversight Committee  Michael Cohen  the president s longtime fixer and personal lawyer  detailed accusations of sleaziness and potential criminality that included tax fraud  bank fraud  wire fraud and conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws  Little of what Mr  Cohen shared was new  but it was important nonetheless  allowing the public its first opportunity to hear someone with intimate knowledge run through the catalog of the president s shameless and lawless behavior Look for Mr  Nadler s effort to bring many more such brutal spectacles as he seeks to build his case  This is what oversight looks like  It is not for the faint of heart

President Trump has tried to halt the arrival of undocumented migrants by beefing up border security  limiting who qualifies for asylum and  for a while  separating migrant children from their parents at the border  However  figures released on Tuesday suggest that those measures are failing to deter tens of thousands of migrants from journeying over land to the United States Indeed  after shriveling to the smallest total in five decades  the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border   the best indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the United States   is soaring again Border authorities detained nearly twice as many migrants   268 044   in the first five months of the fiscal year that started in October than were detained in the same period the previous year To understand what s happening  it s important to look at who is coming  what is driving them and how the answers to those questions have changed over the years   Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  It used to be about Mexico  But no more In the past  undocumented immigrants were overwhelmingly single men from Mexico who slipped into the country undetected to find work and send money home  But immigration from Mexico has plummeted in recent years  In fact  more Mexicans are leaving than arriving in the United States  Mexicans are less compelled to come because there are more opportunities in their own country and they have smaller families to support Central American families have become the new face of undocumented immigration In the first five months of the fiscal year that began in October  the Border Patrol detained 136 150 people traveling in families with children  compared with 107 212 during all of fiscal 2018 A trend toward family migration from Central America that began when Barack Obama was president has endured  after temporarily dipping during Mr  Trump s first year in office   More than 76 000 migrants cross in a month  Read about the  breaking points   Poverty is driving much of the latest migrationMany Central Americans live in fear  El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala have among the world s highest homicide rates  Arriving migrants report that they have faced extortion  and want to prevent their children from being recruited by street gangs But murder rates in the Northern Triangle countries have been declining in recent years  and economic imperatives are believed to be the most important push factor for the majority of recent arrivals  More than 90 percent of the most recent migrants are from Guatemala  according to the newly released data  The majority hail from impoverished regions  including the Western highlands  where conflicts over land rights  environmental changes and depressed prices for crops like maize and coffee are undermining the ability of farmers to make a living  Read about the treatment of detainees with medical conditions  Traveling with children is helping migrants avoid detentionMigrants generally lack understanding of United States immigration law  But they appear to be informed about the basics The majority know to request asylum at the border  either at an official port of entry or when they surrender to border agents shortly after sneaking into the country from Mexico They know that they are unlikely to remain detained if they travel with a child and that they have a better shot at fending off deportation when they come with a child By law  the government cannot keep migrant families in holding facilities at the border for more than 72 hours  It must either transfer them to an immigration detention facility suitable for children or release them  The government has been letting thousands of detained migrants go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention facilities  Immigration and Customs Enforcement s three residential family centers   two in southern Texas and one in Pennsylvania   can accommodate 3 326 parents and children The largest share of migrants arrive in Texas  but there appears to be a growing number who are entering through remote areas of Arizona and New Mexico Zero tolerance didn t workIn the spring of 2018  the Trump administration tried to discourage parents from traveling with a child by prosecuting everyone who crossed the border illegally  even those who were traveling with children   a policy known as zero tolerance  This resulted in children being removed from their parents and placed in shelters across the country The policy drew widespread condemnation  prompting the president to halt the practice in late June  But Customs and Border Protection officials believe that the various legal rulings preventing families from being detained have helped solidify the message to smugglers  who roam villages offering to guide people to the United States  that adults who come with a child are protected from deportation It s not that easy to get asylum  thoughWhether they sneak into the country in remote areas or enter the country through a port of entry  most migrants are trying to petition for asylum In 2008  just under 5 000 applicants claimed they had a credible fear of persecution  the first legal step toward obtaining asylum  to avoid being returned to their homeland  Last year  nearly 100 000 claimed a credible fear The Trump administration contends that people are flooding the asylum system with invalid claims  In recent years  immigration judges have granted less than 20 percent of asylum requests  a proportion that is even lower for Central Americans Many asylum seekers from Central America claim they have been victims of gangs  which is harder to prove than political and other types of persecution  Poverty is not among the grounds for receiving asylum If they are denied  asylum seekers can be deported  But since many are released while their case is pending  some never return to court and evade deportation  
WASHINGTON   Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  on Wednesday tersely defended a now defunct Trump administration practice of separating migrant children from their families at the border  sidestepping whether she supported it as a way to deter illegal immigration In tense exchanges with House Democrats  Ms  Nielsen instead implored Congress to confront what she called a  humanitarian catastrophe  on the southern border by changing laws to crack down on illegal border crossings She also said the Trump administration s family separation practice was similar to those of previous presidents   even if only sporadically enforced in earlier cases  It was a policy by this administration that only ended when there were pictures of little kids in cages that had been ripped away from their parents   Representative Kathleen Rice  Democrat of New York  told Ms  Nielsen during a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee  Update  Kirstjen Nielsen out as Trump s homeland security secretary  Ms  Nielsen replied that Ms  Rice mischaracterized the administration s enforcement  That s a policy   Ms  Rice said   You should admit it  Ms  Nielsen noted that parents are generally separated from their children when they go to jail for illegal activities  But  that wasn t the point  of the immigration policy  she said  The point was to increase prosecutions for those breaking the law   she added  Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  The hearing was Ms  Nielsen s first since Democrats took control of the House this year  She backed President Trump s request to declare a national emergency at the border   which would give him access to funding to build a border wall   and cited new data from her department showing that the number of immigrants entering the United States illegally had doubled from a year ago Immigration officials are on track to apprehend one million people crossing the southern border this year  Ms  Nielsen said  This is not a manufactured crisis   Ms  Nielsen said   This is truly an emergency  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  later accused Democrats of refusing to acknowledge a crisis at the border  She also chastised Senate Republicans who did not support the president s emergency declaration  If you had done what you were elected to do on the front end  then the president would not have to fix the problem on his own through a national emergency   Ms  Sanders said Some Republicans at the House hearing said they supported building a wall along the border Representative Daniel Crenshaw  Republican of Texas  acknowledged the concerns about family separations but said physical barriers were crucial to securing the long stretches of land between ports of entry Mr  Crenshaw said he now doubted that  we all value the rule of law and value the ability to manage our border effectively    a view he admitted was cynical The Department of Homeland Security has opened three investigations into the Trump administration s immigration policies  the agency s acting inspector general  John V  Kelly  said in a separate hearing on Wednesday Mr  Kelly said one investigation is looking into the department s systems for tracking migrant children separated from their families  another is examining whether asylum seeking families are being separated at the border Department investigators were also reviewing whether parents facing deportation were given the option of bringing their children back home with them  In the hearing with Ms  Nielsen  Ms  Rice asked whether every relative facing deportation was  in fact  allowed to do so  To the best of my knowledge  every parent was afforded that option   Ms  Nielsen said In the past  most undocumented immigrants entering the United States from Mexico were single men looking for work  But over the past year  the number of migrants traveling together as a family has soared   a point that Ms  Nielsen sought to underscore Officials have said migrants   and the smugglers who exploit them   know they are unlikely to be detained if they travel with a child Under a court order  the government is prohibited from keeping children in holding facilities at the border for more than 72 hours  Children must either be transferred to immigration detention facilities suitable for minors  or be released The government has allowed thousands of detained migrants to go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention facilities  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  a branch of Ms  Nielsen s department  can accommodate only 3 326 parents and children in its three residential family centers Democrats also criticized Ms  Nielsen for not adequately keeping track of migrant children who were separated from their parents last year  You let kids be separated without tracking them  Do you know how outrageous that is  Madam Secretary   said Representative Nanette Barragán  Democrat of California   You have no feeling  no compassion  no empathy here  Ms  Nielsen did not respond The practice  part of a  zero tolerance  immigration policy that drew swift condemnation after it was publicly announced last spring  quickly became a symbol of the president s crackdown on illegal immigration  At the time  Ms  Nielsen repeatedly denied that her department had a policy of routinely separating migrant children from their parents at the border  despite mounting evidence that thousands of families had been broken apart During a news conference in June at the White House  she said she was offended by accusations that she would authorize separating children from their parents to send a message of deterrence  But the department continued to separate families until Mr  Trump  facing enormous public pressure  signed an executive order meant to end the policy Representative Bennie Thompson  Democrat of Mississippi and the committee s chairman  said he had requested documents on the treatment of asylum seekers at the border and family separations  After Wednesday s hearing  Mr  Thompson told reporters that he expected that information within a week and was prepared to use subpoena powers as a  last resort   The secretary can choose whether to be complicit in this administration s misinformation campaign   Mr  Thompson said   or she can correct the record  For much of her tenure  Ms  Nielsen has been the subject of Mr  Trump s ire over illegal immigration and border security Mr  Trump berated her privately for not doing enough to stop illegal immigration and accelerate construction of a wall along the border with Mexico  The president grew repeatedly angry with Ms  Nielsen for telling him that his ideas to stop immigration would be illegal or improper By year s end  reports were rampant that Mr  Trump wanted to fire Ms  Nielsen  but her credibility with the president has since improved  During the government s 35 day shutdown over funding for the president s border wall  Ms  Nielsen was a fierce advocate for the wall And on Wednesday morning  Ms  Nielsen made clear she would not stray far from the president s anti immigrant language  We face a crisis   a real  serious and sustained crisis at our borders   Ms  Nielsen said 
WASHINGTON   After a White House meeting last July  President Trump and Jean Claude Juncker  the European Commission president  stepped into the Rose Garden and proclaimed they had a trade deal or  at the very least  the makings of a future pact Eight months later  it is increasingly obvious that the two leaders had nothing close to that level of agreement American and European negotiators are at odds over what to include in a prospective trade deal  ratcheting up trans Atlantic tensions and jeopardizing talks before they even begin  Trump administration officials insist that any deal must address the agricultural trade barriers that the president says put American farmers at a disadvantage  in part because such an agreement would be more likely to win congressional approval  European officials counter that agriculture was never on the table   not last July  and not now  It should cover industrial goods  and that s it   Cecilia Malmstrom  the European trade commissioner  said in Bucharest  Romania  last month   We are not talking about agriculture  The United States disagrees  Top Trump administration officials say agriculture was always going to be part of the trade equation  even if that is not what the president and Mr  Juncker initially agreed to in their meeting  We were aware of that issue from Day 1   Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  said in an interview last week  The United States always assumed agriculture would be included in any deal  he said  adding   You re not going to have a far reaching E U  trade deal without agriculture  The competing narratives of what European and American officials agreed to cover in trade talks are the latest spat between traditional allies whose relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades  Mr  Trump has imposed stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union  prompting Europe to retaliate with levies on American orange juice  motorcycles and tobacco  The president has taken to criticizing the European Union s trade practices and its treatment of American farmers as being  even worse  than China s  And Mr  Trump continues to threaten Europe with tariffs on imported autos and auto parts The threat of auto tariffs is what got Mr  Juncker to the negotiating table  according to Mr  Trump  The president views the tariffs   which would be particularly harmful for German automakers   as his key to unlocking what he wants from Europe  namely more access for American beef  chicken  dairy and wine  We re trying to make a deal   Mr  Trump said at the White House last month   They re very tough to make a deal with  the E U  If we don t make the deal  we ll do the tariffs  But while Mr  Trump sees the car tariffs as leverage  the Europeans see them as a bomb that could shatter negotiations  If there ever were to be the unilateral imposition of tariffs  the talks would be ended   David O Sullivan  the departing European Union ambassador to the United States  said late last month The two sides are trying to move forward  Ms  Malmstrom met with Robert Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  on Wednesday  while Mr  Kudlow and Martin Selmayr  the European Commission s secretary general  will convene on Thursday Mr  Trump technically has until mid May to make a decision on the auto tariffs  though legal experts say he could continue to delay as long as talks continue  The Commerce Department  which has been studying the tariffs  sent a report with its findings to the White House on Feb  17 The details have not been made public  but a draft that circulated in early February determined that auto imports threatened the United States  national security  according to one person who viewed it  Such a finding would pave the way for Mr  Trump to impose across the board tariffs  The report also presented other actions the president could take to stem imports  including trade barriers focused exclusively on autonomous vehicles and parts  according to several people familiar with the findings Mr  Trump had prioritized restarting trade talks with the Europeans as part of his global push to negotiate deals on his own terms  But as the president dangled the threat of tariffs last July  the Americans and the Europeans were not sure they could even reach an agreement to begin negotiating The night before the July 25 Rose Garden ceremony  Mr  Kudlow and Mr  Selmayr met over Diet Cokes at the Hay Adams hotel near the White House  Mr  Kudlow had been encouraged by common interests between the United States and Europe  particularly a European offer to import large volumes of natural gas and soybeans The next day  the two sides worked furiously to iron out a statement outlining the scope of a trade deal  Mr  Kudlow shuffled drafts of the joint statement back and forth between the Americans and the Europeans  who were holed up in separate rooms in the White House  The Americans inserted agriculture into the draft  only to watch the Europeans take it out  according to one person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly  The two sides finally settled on the phrase  open markets for farmers and workers   which the Europeans say referred only to the bloc s offer to buy American soybeans Image You re not going to have a far reaching E U  trade deal without agriculture   said Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesMr  Trump had raised the issue of agriculture in his meeting with Mr  Juncker  according to people present  who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly  But when Mr  Juncker made clear that a negotiation that included agriculture would also include other hard to resolve issues  the president acquiesced  I m a results man   Mr  Trump said  arguing for a quicker turnaround The scope of the deal was announced but  almost immediately  American negotiators began lobbying to get agriculture back into the mix The day after the announcement  Mr  Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  told a Senate committee that he would not recommend negotiating a trade deal with the European Union without agriculture   Our view is that we are negotiating about agriculture  period   Mr  Lighthizer said   That s part of the process  Mr  Trump s advisers now say the initial announcement was an attempt to reap what they call an  early harvest   and circle back later for a more comprehensive deal  But some analysts say Mr  Trump s penchant for announcing victory before the details are finalized is now coming back to haunt him  It clearly frustrated the president s advisers  who apparently did not expect him to give that one away   wrote William Reinsch  the Scholl chair in international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington Mr  Kudlow said that American negotiators knew what they were trading and that they were just hoping to get the talks restarted  We decided to take what we could get   in effect reopening E U  trade talks   Mr  Kudlow said   And don t forget  looming in the background was the issue of auto tariffs  Agriculture accounts for less than 2 percent of the European Union s gross domestic product  but the sector is heavily subsidized  It also reliably stirs emotions among European voters and mobilizes public opposition Farmers are a powerful and militant constituency  especially in France  which is Europe s biggest producer of agricultural products and the biggest recipient of European Union subsidies Emmanuel Macron  the French president  is struggling with mass protests against his plans to overhaul the French economy  and farmers are already restive  Last week  they rumbled through cities like Bordeaux and Nantes in convoys of tractors and blocked a highway interchange near Lyon  They were protesting a trade deal being negotiated with several South American countries that  according to some reports  would allow more beef imports Even Europeans who live in cities are often sympathetic to farmers  who are seen as custodians of a rural way of life  In many countries  food is closely linked with national identity Parmesan cheese from Italy  Ibérico ham from Spain and many other products are protected by trademarks reserved exclusively for the regions that produce them  Farmers and consumers fear an influx of American products  which suffer generally from the perception  often false  that they contain more pesticides  hormones or artificial ingredients than European products The European Union and the United States have long recognized the need to present a united front on global trade practices  especially as China s power and influence have grown But despite deep cultural and historic ties  the American European trade partnership has not been easy  The two sides have squabbled for decades over differences in farm subsidies  food safety standards  government procurement practices and retaliatory tariffs   including the United States  25 percent tariff on foreign trucks  a legacy of a 1960s trade fight Those differences slowed talks over the Trans Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  a prospective Obama era trade deal that was scrapped when Mr  Trump came into office The experience of negotiating that pact taught the two sides a valuable lesson  A deal that involved agriculture and other thorny issues would be time consuming  while one focused on industrial goods could be done quickly  Mr  O Sullivan said  This is not an accident   he said of the agreement reached last summer European political leaders and legislators are expected within weeks to give Ms  Malmstrom a formal mandate to negotiate with the United States  Europe has already more than doubled its imports of American soybeans since Mr  Trump and Mr  Juncker met in July But many European political leaders are livid at Mr  Trump for  in their view  undermining the trans Atlantic alliance and damaging the European economy when it is already vulnerable  They are not in a mood to give Mr  Trump a victory  The current U S  attitude is   We want this  this and this  and if not  beware of the consequences    said Marietje Schaake  a member of the European Parliament s delegation for relations with the United States 
ISLAMABAD  Pakistan   Pakistan said on Tuesday that it would take new steps to seize and freeze the assets of people and militant groups who are on the United Nations  list of designated terrorists  after months of international criticism The announcement came as India and Pakistan were still on edge after a suicide bombing in Kashmir last month led to a military clash between the two  And last month  a financial watchdog group  the Paris based Financial Action Task Force  said Pakistan was still not taking enough concrete steps to curb financing and money laundering by terrorist groups Pakistan risks being blacklisted by the task force  which would open the door to international sanctions that would be devastating to the country s already teetering economy Pakistan s military has long been accused by its neighbors and Western countries of cultivating militant groups to use as proxies  including the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar e Taiba  which was widely accused of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed more than 160 people The financial task force demanded more action in particular against Lashkar e Taiba and against Jaish e Muhammad  a militant group that claimed responsibility for the Feb  14 bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers  There is a total consensus across all state institutions that these religious militias of all kinds represent a liability from the 1990s  a baggage of the past   Moeed Pirzada  an analyst and television news host who has been briefed by civilian and military officials  said in an interview on Tuesday   They don t serve any purpose and need to be absorbed into mainstream society through alternate job creation  Mr  Pirzada said the main challenge was to make inroads against such groups by taking over the religious schools  hospitals and relief organizations that they operate as fronts  Prime Minister Imran Khan s government made some budgetary allowances for those actions in December  he said India Pakistan Crisis  Why They Keep Fighting Over KashmirA simple guide to the roots of the conflict and what could happen next  An American cricket club carries on despite India Pakistan tensions  On Tuesday  Pakistani officials promised to take stronger action in the coming weeks against militant groups that operate inside Pakistani territory Pakistan has made those promises before  including when it was put on the financial task force s so called gray list early last year  at the request of the Trump administration But Pakistani officials say that there is greater urgency now  and that Mr  Khan s administration is worried about becoming an international pariah if it fails to act  On Monday evening  Mr  Khan gave a rare background briefing to news show hosts in which he reportedly emphasized that the time had come to do more to crack down on militant groups Pakistani officials say they plan to freeze the assets of more groups  and to take control of religious seminaries that are affiliated with them  The officials said that more travel restrictions would also be imposed on militant leaders In an initial sign of a crackdown  the Pakistani authorities have detained 44 people  including the brother and son of Masood Azhar  the chief of Jaish e Muhammad  Shehryar Afridi  the state minister for interior  who announced the move during a news conference in Islamabad  did not specify any charges and said the detentions were meant for investigations Mr  Afridi said the names of Mufti Abdur Raoof  the brother of Mr  Azhar  and Hammad Azhar  the son of Mr  Azhar  were included in a dossier that Indian authorities handed to Pakistan for investigations into the Feb  14 Kashmir attack Azam Suleman Khan  the interior secretary  said those detained would be freed if found innocent   In case we don t find any evidence against them  we will release them   Mr  Khan said As Pakistan continued to extend gestures that it wanted normalization of ties  its Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Sohail Mehmood  the country s ambassador to India  would return to New Delhi to resume his duties  The ambassador was recalled to Islamabad last month after tensions erupted over the Kashmir attack Pakistan also said on Tuesday that a delegation would visit India on March 14 to discuss a draft agreement on a Sikh pilgrimage corridor between the estranged neighbors  The Pakistani visit will be followed by a reciprocal Indian visit  officials said 
The number of migrant families crossing the southwest border has once again broken records  with unauthorized entries nearly double what they were a year ago  suggesting that the Trump administration s aggressive policies have not discouraged new migration to the United States More than 76 000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February  an 11 year high and a strong sign that stepped up prosecutions  new controls on asylum and harsher detention policies have not reversed what remains a powerful lure for thousands of families fleeing violence and poverty  The system is well beyond capacity  and remains at the breaking point   Kevin K  McAleenan  commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  told reporters in announcing the new data on Tuesday The nation s top border enforcement officer painted a picture of processing centers filled to capacity  border agents struggling to meet medical needs and thousands of exhausted members of migrant families crammed into a detention system that was not built to house them   all while newcomers continue to arrive  sometimes by the busload  at the rate of 2 200 a day  This is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis   Mr  McAleenan said  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border   a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next

but a humanitarian challenge created as thousands of migrant families surge into remote areas where the administration has so far failed to devote sufficient resources to care for them  as is required under the law The latest numbers stung an administration that has over the past two years introduced a rash of aggressive policies intended to deter migrants from journeying to the United States  including separating families  limiting entries at official ports and requiring some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico through the duration of their immigration cases More than 50 000 adults are currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody  the highest number ever Despite targeted successes in certain areas   about 2 000 migrants who traveled in a caravan from Central America last year appeared to have given up their cause as of last month after being discouraged by long delays in Tijuana   migrants seem only to have adjusted their routes rather than turn back  Indeed  they are traveling in even larger numbers than before  Read more about why more migrants are crossing the border  Arrests along the southern border have increased 97 percent since last year  the Border Patrol said  with a 434 percent increase in the El Paso sector  which covers the state of New Mexico and the two westernmost counties of Texas  Families  mainly from Central America  continue to arrive in ever larger groups in remote parts of the southwest At least 70 such groups of 100 or more people have turned themselves in at Border Patrol stations that typically are staffed by only a handful of agents  often hours away from civilization  By comparison  only 13 such groups arrived in the last fiscal year  and two in the year before Understanding what is happening on the border is difficult because  while the numbers are currently higher than they have been in several years  they are nowhere near the historic levels of migration seen across the southwest border  Arrests for illegally crossing the border reached up to 1 64 million in 2000  under President Clinton  In the 2018 fiscal year  they reached 396 579  For the first five months of the current fiscal year  268 044 have been apprehended ImageMigrants from Central America turned themselves in to Border Patrol agents in Penitas  Tex   last month CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe difference is that the nature of immigration has changed  and the demographics of those arriving now are proving more taxing for border officials to accommodate  Most of those entering the country in earlier years were single men  most of them from Mexico  coming to look for work  If they were arrested  they could quickly be deported Now  the majority of border crossers are not single men but families   fathers from Honduras with adolescent boys they are pulling away from gang violence  mothers with toddlers from Guatemala whose farms have been lost to drought  While they may not have a good case to remain in the United States permanently  it is not so easy to speedily deport them if they arrive with children and claim protection under the asylum laws Families with children can be held in detention for no longer than 20 days  under a much debated court ruling  and since there are a limited number of detention centers certified to hold families  the practical effect is that most families are released into the country to await their hearings in immigration court  The courts are so backlogged that it could take months or years for cases to be decided  Some people never show up for court at all Finally  detaining families even for the first few days after their arrival in the United States  while they are undergoing initial processing  is also a challenging job Often arriving exhausted  dehydrated  and some of them requiring urgent medical care  the families need food  diapers  infant formula and space to play  They can often spend days inside cramped concrete cells that were built to house the previous generation of border crossers   young  single men who would likely be there only a few hours As part of the announcements on Tuesday  Mr  McAleenan also said the agency is making sweeping changes to procedures for guaranteeing adequate medical care for migrants   an overhaul brought on by the deaths of two migrant children in the agency s custody in December  The measures  which include comprehensive health screenings for all migrant children and a new processing center in El Paso that would help provide better shelter and medical care for migrant families  are an attempt to fix years of health care inadequacies that have left many at risk The agency will also expand medical contracts to place health care practitioners   largely registered nurses and nurse practitioners   in  high risk  and high traffic locations along the border  It will also dedicate more money for translation services to meet increasing demand from Central Americans  many of whom speak indigenous languages and dialects and may not be able to communicate their needs in English or Spanish ImageA migrant child from Honduras at a shelter in El Paso  Tex  As of March 3  237 327 migrants had been apprehended along the southwest border since the fiscal year began in October  a 97 percent increase from the previous year CreditSara Naomi Lewkowicz for The New York Times Read  Border Patrol Facilities Put Detainees With Medical Conditions at Risk  These solutions are temporary and this situation is not sustainable   Mr  McAleenan said Mr  McAleenan said the authorities believe that the large numbers of families are coming because smugglers have effectively communicated across Central America that adults who travel with children will be allowed to enter and stay in the United States Brian Hastings  the agency s chief of law enforcement operations  said that since April 2018  border agents had detected nearly 2 400  false families   including cases in which migrants had falsely claimed to be related when they were not  or untruthfully claimed to be younger than 18 The throngs of new families are also affecting communities on the American side of the border  In El Paso  a volunteer network that temporarily houses the migrants after they are released from custody has had to expand to 20 facilities  compared with only three during the same period last year  Migrants are now being housed in churches  a converted nursing home and about 125 hotel rooms that are being paid for with donations  We had never seen these kinds of numbers   said Ruben Garcia  the director of the organization  called Annunciation House  He said that during one week in February  immigration authorities had released more than 3 600 migrants to his organization  the highest number in any single week since the group s founding in 1978 For the most part  Mr  Garcia said that his staff and volunteer workers had been able to keep up with the surge  often making frantic calls to churches to request access to more space for housing families on short notice  But sometimes their best efforts were upended  he said  including on one day last week  when the authorities dropped off 150 more migrants than planned  We just didn t have the space   Mr  Garcia said 
Yemen s deputy culture minister  Abdulhadi al Azazi  remembers standing two years ago amid the rubble of a national museum in his war torn hometown  Taiz Objects he had admired as a youngster   ancient limestone carvings  gilded Torah scrolls  bejeweled Islamic daggers  a spindly 2 500 year old mummy   were missing amid the charred debris and shattered display cases  The museum was wrecked and everything was stolen   he said in a telephone interview   Everywhere in our country we see the same thing happening now  Some four years into a civil war in which members of a Northern Yemeni faction known as Houthis have fought Saudi backed Yemeni forces to a stalemate  the extent of the human suffering has drawn global attention  Less noticed have been the cultural institutions and archaeological relics lost or ravaged during the conflict  including thousands of antiquities taken from Yemen s museums  Read more about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen  In an effort to recover some of the items  Yemeni officials visited Washington and New York in recent days to ask the Trump administration and the United Nations to help them forestall the scattering of a heritage that stretches back nearly 4 000 years  Their central request is that the United States issue an emergency order that would bar the import of Yemeni artifacts that did not carry special documentation Typically  antiquities from abroad cannot enter the country without documentation mandated in one on one agreements between the nation of origin and the United States  Because Yemen is not party to any such agreement  its artifacts simply need to be declared at customs in a routine way The Saudi backed Yemeni government hopes the United States will impose new rules requiring importers to show proof that the objects had been legally obtained  That proof could be in the form of a government authorization or documents proving that the items had a well established provenance trail dating from before the civil war  Yemen was a cradle to many civilizations and a home to multiple faiths  particularly Judaism  Christianity and Islam  which all thrived here   Yemen s culture minister  Marwan Dammaj  said in New York on Wednesday  He denounced the pillaging as  a gross affront to humanity at large  ImageMarwan Dammaj  the culture minister of Yemen  at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Wednesday CreditJohannes BergRestrictions on antiquity imports are usually painstakingly negotiated and require a petitioning nation to show proof of ongoing thefts  illegal excavations and illicit exports  Care is taken not to disrupt any legal trade in a country s cultural heritage objects  or to interfere with museum loans and educational exchanges  Nations seeking the curbs must show they are working to crack down on black markets and safeguard their relics Nonetheless  the United States has in recent years issued emergency orders on behalf of Iraq  Syria  Libya and Mali  In the case of Syria  for example  Congress voted to impose the restrictions in 2016 after terrorist groups were found to be profiteering from the country s antiquities to pay for weapons and recruitment The Yemenis say they have strong evidence that their artifacts are being sold off by Houthi fighters and by terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State  which infiltrated the country during its current turmoil  To bolster those claims  Mr  Dammaj circulated a 290 page report in Arabic and English that details the looting at the Aden National Museum  the Taiz National Museum and the National Museum of Zinjibar ImageThe marble head of a horse  thought to have been created between 1 000 B C  and 800 B C   that was taken from the Zinjibar Museum in Yemen CreditYemen Culture MinistryAccompanying it is a catalog of 1 631 objects missing from the museums  The list includes items that stretch back into the depths of civilization in a region known as a vital early trading crossroads  including ivory figurines from the ancient Kingdom of Saba  the mythic realm of the Queen of Sheba   Roman era golden coins and marble statuettes  and brass finials and Hebrew manuscripts from the many centuries when Jews populated what is now southern Arabia  It is clear that violent extremists are plundering our treasures and smuggling them overseas   said Mr  Dammaj  who met with State and Treasury Department officials  American law enforcement authorities and United Nations representatives State Department officials said the agency is studying the request  It is important that we take steps now to prevent the further degradation of invaluable cultural property and heritage sites in Yemen   the department said in a statement   We want to help prevent malign actors from profiting from the looting  theft and sale of conflict antiquities  ImageAlso reported stolen from the Zinjibar Museum  this limestone sculpture is thought to date from 1000 to 800 B C   during the time of the Kingdom of Saba CreditYemen Culture MinistryMr  Dammaj said Houthis have been arrested several times in the act of smuggling antiquities and have been seen ransacking cultural sites Although it is impossible to corroborate every allegation  independent groups that follow Yemen s plight have also cited a Houthi role in the sacking of some cultural sites  Mwatana  an independent Yemeni human rights group  has cited those forces in the looting of several museums  though it has also accused Saudi air forces of bombing cultural sites where they believed Houthi combatants had taken shelter Last month  the Malaysia based Islamic Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization assailed the Houthis for plundering manuscripts  historical texts and Islamic relics from the library of Zabid  Yemen s capital during the 13th and 15th centuries Deborah Lehr  the chairwoman of the Antiquities Coalition  a Washington group that combats cultural racketeering and helped Yemen assemble and publish the English language version of its report  said her group had been in contact with foreign archaeologists on the ground in Yemen who reported evidence of looting by the Houthi faction 
A prominent Iranian lawyer who defended women arrested when they defied Iran s head covering rule has been convicted of security related crimes in a secret trial and could face a  very lengthy sentence   a human rights monitoring group reported Wednesday The group  the Center for Human Rights in Iran  said it had learned of the conviction of the lawyer  Nasrin Sotoudeh  from her husband  She was seized at her home by security agents last June and placed in Evin Prison in Tehran Ms  Sotoudeh  55  who has been in and out of Iranian prisons several times  is an international symbol of defiance to the limits on personal and political freedoms imposed by the Islamic Republic s religious hierarchy  She won Europe s most prestigious human rights award  the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought  in 2012 The Iranian authorities have never specified why they seized her in June  but at the time Ms  Sotoudeh was defending women arrested when they removed their hijabs  or Islamic head scarves  in public protests Ms  Sotoudeh may also have angered the judicial authorities by publicly criticizing their decision to limit legal representation for defendants in political cases to a list of 20 state approved lawyers  Ms  Sotoudeh was not on that list  No amount of spin will be able to conceal the fact that Sotoudeh is being persecuted for her peaceful defense of human rights in Iran  including a woman s right to choose whether to wear a hijab   said Hadi Ghaemi  the executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran  which is based in New York Last September  Ms  Sotoudeh was tried in a Revolutionary Court in Tehran but refused to appear because she could not choose her lawyer  according to an account posted on the website of Mr  Ghaemi s group Her husband  Reza Khandan  was sentenced to six years in January for illicitly posting updates about his wife s case on Facebook  but he has yet to be imprisoned on that charge  Mr  Ghaemi said  The couple have two young children Mr  Ghaemi said Mr  Khandan had told him his wife recently requested from prison that a lawyer of her own choosing be allowed to examine the case file against her  The request was denied  Mr  Ghaemi quoted him as saying  because  the verdict has been issued and the case is closed  While the details have not been disclosed  Mr  Ghaemi said  at least seven charges are believed to have been lodged against Ms  Sotoudeh  They included collusion against national security  anti state propaganda  membership in illicit groups  appearing before the judiciary without the required head covering  disturbing the peace  publishing falsehoods to disturb public opinion  and  encouraging corruption and prostitution   Each charge has many years   Mr  Ghaemi said   It could be a very lengthy sentence  Ms  Sotoudeh s conviction has not been reported in official Iranian news media  There was no immediate response to a request for comment from Iran s United Nations mission in New York The prosecution of Ms  Sotoudeh has come against the backdrop of a resurgence of influence by the most hard line elements of Iran s leadership  particularly since the Trump administration took office two years ago President Trump has moved aggressively to ostracize Iran  renouncing the nuclear agreement it reached with the Obama administration and five other world powers  and reimposing sanctions that the accord had eased in return for Iran s peaceful nuclear development Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  Iran s supreme leader  has said the Trump administration s policies proved his longstanding suspicion that the United States could not be trusted   a view that may have emboldened the hard liners in the government and weakened President Hassan Rouhani  who is considered a relative moderate The National Iranian American Council  a Washington based group that advocates for improved relations with Iran but is highly critical of the country s human rights record  said it was appalled by news of Ms  Sotoudeh s conviction and called for her immediate release Jamal Abdi  the council s president  said in a statement that responsibility for Ms  Sotoudeh s incarceration  lies squarely with the Iranian authorities   But he also pointed a finger at the Trump administration  As hard liners seek to match Trump s bellicosity and undermine moderates and the will of the Iranian people   Mr  Abdi said   human rights proponents like Sotoudeh often become the first victims  
WASHINGTON   Patriot Puck  a New York based company  wrapped its hockey pucks in American flags  declaring them  The Only American Made Hockey Puck  The mattress firm Nectar Sleep  founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs  promoted its mattresses as  designed and assembled in the U S A  Two California based manufacturers of deployment bags  tactical gear and other merchandise marketed to active and retired American military personnel sold the products online as  MadeInUSA  and inserted  American Made  tags into its products In reality  most of the products were manufactured entirely in China  according to the Federal Trade Commission Last fall  the F T C  determined that all four companies had violated federal law by engaging in  unfair or deceptive acts  and falsely marketing their goods as American made But while President Trump has accused China of destroying American jobs and prioritized strengthening United States manufacturing  his appointees at the F T C  did little to punish the firms  The companies faced no fines and were not required to admit any wrongdoing or to notify customers of their false marketing  The trade commission entered into proposed consent agreements with each firm barring them from falsely marketing their products with the threat of fines if they violated the agreement  A final decision on the penalties is expected in the coming weeks after a public comment period ends The trade commission s treatment of the companies has angered Democratic lawmakers  who are urging the Trump administration to pursue tougher punishments for companies that profit by producing products in China and falsely labeling them as American made ImageA Nectar Sleep mattress  The company had labeled its products as  designed and assembled in the U S A   In reality they are mostly made in China CreditNectar Sleep We call on the commission to do more to protect American manufacturers and consumers   a group of senators wrote to the F T C  last month  Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut  Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin asked the agency to  provide specific insights about the commission s decision to seek no consequences in these brazen instances of fraudulently labeling goods as  Made in the USA   From the campaign trail to the White House  Mr  Trump has directed much of his focus to rebuilding American jobs and industries  In April 2017  Mr  Trump signed a  Buy American and Hire American  executive order  with the goal of promoting the use of  American made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job  Mr  Trump has put a particular focus on revitalizing American manufacturing  which he says has been decimated by cheap Chinese labor and materials That has Democrats questioning why the agency is not being more aggressive in going after American companies that manufacture their goods in China  Many companies that manufacture at home are already treading water   Rohit Chopra  a Democratic F T C  commissioner who disagreed with the decision  said in an interview   American companies shouldn t lose out to corporate cheaters who lie on their labels  Mr  Brown  who is considering running for president  said the agency s penalty did not match the severity of the companies  behavior  If companies that break our laws do not face financial penalties  then our American manufacturers are severely undermined   Mr  Brown said   We need stronger enforcement by the F T C  and greater transparency when it comes to the commission s actions to crack down on these violators  Some agency officials  including one of its two Democratic commissioners  defended the settlement  saying that the threat of future penalties was a strong deterrent  The companies face a  40 000 penalty per violation if they are caught making false claims again  And officials said the agency did not seek monetary relief  in part  because there was no  price premium   meaning the goods were not more expensive than similar products sold by competitors  who also imported their products but did not falsely label them as American made ImageMr  Trump focused on revitalizing American manufacturing and held a  Made in America  event at the White House last year CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times In our view  a thoughtful review and forward looking plan is a more effective and efficient use of commission resources than reopening and relitigating the cases before us today   Joseph J  Simons  the F T C  chairman  and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter  a Democratic commissioner  wrote in a statement in September But at least one company has complained to the commission  alleging in a letter that the backpack manufacturer s misleading claim cost it lucrative contracts  Sandpiper caused confusion to at least one organizational buyer at the Army and Air Force Exchange Service looking for  Made in the USA  products   Alan Watts  a lawyer representing a competing company  Advantus  wrote to the commission in October   This caused a very real unfair competitive disadvantage to Advantus whose compliance with the law caused it to lose sales  The F T C  has a long history of weak enforcement in  Made in America  cases that preceded Mr  Trump s tenure  The commission lists on its website 26  Made in America  cases it has reviewed since 1999  In some of those cases  companies have agreed to a monetary settlement  In 2016  for instance  Chemence  a specialty chemical company  agreed to pay  220 000 to resolve an agency lawsuit  But in many other cases  the settlements required only record keeping and reporting requirements to make sure companies did not violate the law again The commission first found out about the false  Made in America  claims made by the four companies in question now through a dedicated complaint line  according to James Kohm  associate director of the enforcement division for the Bureau of Consumer Protection Mr  Kohm  in an interview  noted that Patriot Pucks went out of business shortly after the F T C  s first ruling in September  and that Sandpiper  one of the tactical gear manufacturers  was sold to a new owner last fall while the company was involved in litigation with the commission  We ve reached a preliminary agreement  whereby the company has not been required to admit any liability   said a lawyer representing Piper Gear  the second tactical gear maker  He said he could not comment further because the settlement was not final After a public comment period  which included the questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill  the commission is expected to issue a final notice on the cases in the coming weeks  The senators  along with Mr  Chopra  are pressing to change the settlement to further penalize the wrongdoers  The commission should consider remedies tailored to the individual circumstances of the fraud  including redress and notice for consumers  disgorgement of ill gotten gains  opt in return programs  or admissions of wrongdoing   Mr  Chopra wrote in a dissenting statement 
Call them the announcements that weren t Over the past two days  Michael R  Bloomberg  the former New York City mayor  Eric H  Holder Jr   the former United States attorney general  and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon officially declared   drumroll  please   that they would not be running for president in 2020  A fourth Democrat  Hillary Clinton  also said  I m not running  to a New York City television station Such is the state of Democratic fervor to challenge President Trump that the party now has a subset of politicians  the almost rans Mr  Bloomberg said he felt his time and personal fortune would be better used promoting immigration reform and gun control and fighting climate change  Mr  Holder wants to continue focusing on ending gerrymandering  Mrs  Clinton  who never seriously pursued a third primary bid  said she would keep  standing up for what I believe   And Mr  Merkley will seek a third term in the Senate in 2020  after the State Legislature rejected his request to allow him to run for both positions simultaneously  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter   I have felt like I m sitting on a fence  and I m getting really uncomfortable sitting on those pickets   said Mr  Merkley in an interview   At some point  you just have to say   O K   I ve weighed it and reweighed and here s the right thing to do   But there are also other challenges and obstacles facing potential 2020 candidates right now The Oxygen ProblemThere are already 14 Democrats running for president  and there is a good chance that a 15th one could enter in the coming weeks  former Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   who would take up a significant share of the ever thinning oxygen in the packed race  Another big name  former Representative Beto O Rourke  is also expected to announce his presidential intentions soon Image I m not running   Hillary Clinton told a New York City television station   But I m going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe  CreditChang W  Lee The New York TimesMr  Biden and Mr  O Rourke would add enormous pressure to the competition among the candidates for aides  donations  volunteers  media attention and voter support  The primary race has already created at least one star  with Senator Kamala Harris  of California  attracting enthusiastic admirers who regularly express the hope that they are witnessing the party s  next Obama   While the four Democrats who just said no to 2020 did not appear intimidated by a Harris  Biden or O Rourke candidacy  building an organization and commanding attention only gets harder amid multiple star candidates There s also the looming deadline of March 31  when candidates must report their first quarter finances to the Federal Election Commission  Those returns will be scrutinized as an early show of relative strength   or weakness   in the race  There is a sense that if you re going to build a presidential team  if you re going to build the fund raising base  you re going to have to work night and day  and you can t wait forever to do that   said Mr  Merkley   There s a compelling sense of many people feeling like you ve got to decide by the end of the first quarter  Candidates who can self finance their campaigns  like Mr  Bloomberg  would still face a fierce competition to be heard  not only among others in the race but amid intensifying efforts by Democrats on Capitol Hill to investigate the Trump administration Even the first Democratic debate in June doesn t hold the promise of much airtime  Depending on how many candidates qualify  the event could become a two night affair  with candidates assigned a spot based on a random drawing The Billionaire ProblemIt didn t go unnoticed by Mr  Bloomberg that he was the last billionaire considering a bid for the Democratic nomination  Tom Steyer  the California liberal activist  opted against running earlier this year  and if the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz runs  he has said he would do so as an independent ImageEric H  Holder Jr   the former attorney general  said he wants to focus on his efforts to end gerrymandering CreditKrista Schlueter for The New York Times I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election   Mr  Bloomberg wrote in a column published Tuesday   But I am cleareyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field  Populist progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have made combating the influence of money in politics a core message of their presidential candidacies   arguments that might have proved challenging for Mr  Bloomberg  whose aides said he would spend at least  500 million of his own fortune to defeat President Trump in 2020 Mr  Bloomberg s moderate  pro business record and generally favorable view of Wall Street would likely also have posed problems in a party that has shifted left on economic issues like taxing the rich and regulating big banks  Some of those arguments could have posed challenges for Mrs  Clinton  too  who spent decades cultivating a network of high dollar donors and close relationships with Wall Street to fund her campaigns The Party ProblemDemocrats lost more than 1 000 seats in state legislatures and governorships during President Barack Obama s two terms in the Oval Office  and those defeats found increased scrutiny once Mr  Trump ascended into the presidency and the Democrats held diminished political power In the three years since  grass roots organizations and Democratic Party leaders have pledged to take recruitment and support for nonpresidential races more seriously  leading some candidates who had considered a run for president to look further down the ticket  In Mr  Merkley s video announcing that he would not run  he said   We need both strong leadership in the Oval Office and strong leadership in the Senate   a sentiment that was met with applause on social media  Stacey Abrams  the Georgia Democrat who lost her bid for governor in 2018  is being heavily recruited for another statewide race in Georgia    Mr  O Rourke  the charismatic Texas Democrat who is expected to run for president after losing a Senate bid in 2018  has also faced several calls to focus his energy at home  Who s in  Who s out  Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  Jeff Hauser  of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington  tweeted that other Democrats should take a page from Mr  Merkley s  principled and realistic playbook  and run for Senate   We need to address the climate crisis  confirm judges   Justices  and in general begin the process of De Trumpification   he wrote ImageSenator Jeff Merkley will run for re election in 2020  Oregon s State Legislature rejected his request to allow him to run for both president and Senate simultaneously CreditJose Luis Magana Associated PressMr  Bloomberg s non announcement announcement included plans to invest further in climate activism  which is another way Democrats are choosing to focus on the party s overall health  Mr  Steyer decided he would instead put his money behind efforts to impeach Mr  Trump Both Mr  Steyer and Mr  Bloomberg said that  unlike Mr  Schultz  they would not consider a third party run  which could risk helping Mr  Trump win re election by siphoning votes from the Democratic candidate The Newness ProblemAnother thing the four non candidates have in common  They all represent the back end of a rapidly changing Democratic Party After their defeat in the 2016 presidential election  a more liberal  more uncompromising wing of the party begin to emerge  desperate to throw off the institutional connections to more centrist figures like the Clintons and Mr  Obama  It was this wing that has helped move presidential candidates further to the left  pushing them to embrace policies like  Medicare for all   the Green New Deal and the rejection of corporate PAC money The new crop of Democrats are also more keen to talk about the importance of a candidate s identity  particularly millennials and nonwhite activists who are driving grass roots changes among Democrats    Anybody But a White Guy 2020   reads a popular sign at presidential rallies  And youth led social movements about sexual harassment  racial justice  and gun control in recent years have forced Democrats to answer uncomfortable questions about the lack of equitable representation among their caucus in terms of race  gender  and class Figures such as Mrs  Clinton  Mr  Bloomberg and Mr  Holder would have been an ideological mismatch for this emerging leftist voice  Mrs  Clinton already struggled to appease the party s left flank during her 2016 run  and the litmus test issues have only moved further from her core policy center since  Social justice activists were raring to challenge Mr  Holder on his record on police reform as head of Department of Justice Even Mr  Sanders seemed caught off guard during a recent appearance on The Breakfast Club  the urban radio show targeted to millennials  when a host asked him   Do we need another white guy as president  
Good Tuesday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Beijing promises business reliefChina s premier said today that his government would respond to an economic slowdown by cutting taxes  easing burdens on the private sector and giving markets a bigger role  Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley of the NYT write 2019 is a  crucial year  for China s economy  Premier Li Keqiang  the second ranking official in the country after President Xi Jinping  said at the opening of the National People s Congress in Beijing this morning  He said the trade war with America had  had an adverse effect   adding   We must be fully prepared for a tough struggle   China has lowered its growth target for this year  Mr  Li said that the nation was now aiming for gross domestic product growth of 6 to 6 5 percent  down from a target of 6 5 percent over the past two years Other policy changes include a reduction in value added tax  which is expected to boost corporate earnings  And Mr  Li said the government would  act with resolve to hand matters it shouldn t manage over to the market  But Mr  Li s speech  did not go as far as domestic or foreign critics would have liked   Mr  Bradsher and Mr  Buckley write  adding that  economic anxieties have come to dominate policy in China  over the past year And China may just need to accept the new normal  A gradual decline in an astonishing growth rate is  what

with the U S Ghosn is finally granted bailA Tokyo court ruled today that the former auto industry leader Carlos Ghosn could post bail  months after he was charged with financial misconduct  The court set the bail at 1 billion yen  or about  9 million It was Mr  Ghosn s third bail request  but the first led by his new legal team  including the high profile defense lawyer Junichiro Hironaka  Prosecutors previously argued that Mr  Ghosn was a flight risk and might tamper with evidence The court imposed strict limits on Mr  Ghosn  including a ban on leaving Japan  surveillance outside his Tokyo residence and a pledge not to contact people beyond his legal team   The bail conditions are severe  but we will make sure to comply   Mr  Hironaka said The battle for bail highlighted Japan s use of what critics call  hostage justice   The FT writes that it  prolongs the detainment of defendants who  like Mr  Ghosn  assert their innocence and refuse to make a confession  Mr  Ghosn isn t free yet  Prosecutors have appealed  and his own legal team says he s unlikely to be released today ImageRepresentative Jerry NadlerCreditSaul Loeb Agence France Presse â   Getty ImagesDemocrats  Trump investigations reach wideThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  Representative Jerry Nadler  issued a flurry of document requests yesterday to all corners of President Trump s world  It s the most sweeping effort yet by Democratic lawmakers to investigate the president for alleged misdeeds Mr  Nadler requested information from 81 people and agencies  including the Trump Organization  the Trump campaign  the Trump Foundation  the inaugural committee  the White House  and family members and aides  Other House committee chairs have requested documents related to Mr  Trump s communications with President Vladimir Putin of Russia Democrats are looking into possible violations of campaign finance law and use of office for personal gain  particularly where it might violate a constitutional ban on foreign emoluments  They re also investigating claims about hush money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels and attacks against critics They clearly won t wait for Robert Mueller  The NYT notes that the House has  a different standard of evidence not wedded to a criminal indictment   Republicans accused their colleagues of laying the groundwork for impeachment proceedings But hurdles remain  Unlike Mr  Mueller  House Democrats can t compel document production by convening a grand jury  And the White House could assert executive privilege to block some

once Time Warner yesterday  days after it beat the Justice Department s effort to block the acquisition  Warner Media  as it now is  has been reorganized to better fight old rivals  like Verizon  and new ones  like Netflix  Who s in  Bob Greenblatt  the former head of NBC and Showtime  will be chairman of Warner Media Entertainment  Jeff Zucker  the current CNN chief  will oversee news and sports  And Kevin Tsujihara will continue to lead the Warner Bros  movie studio  along with a new division for family and kids  programming The battle has two fronts  AT T hopes 24 hour news and content like  Game of Thrones  will help it fend off telecom competitors  But it also wants to compete in streaming against giants like Netflix and Amazon  John Stankey  the head of Warner Media  told the NYT that the reorganization would speed the development of a new online video service The man in the hot seat is Mr  Greenblatt  who as HBO s new boss replaces Richard Plepler  the much admired former C E O  who resisted AT T s desire to make the network more like Netflix  Mr  Greenblatt defended AT T s approach  telling Vanity Fair that HBO would have to increase its output  because now we live in a volume world  and there s no way to really avoid that  More  The New Yorker reported that in the summer of 2017  President Trump ordered Gary Cohn  then his economic adviser  to push the Justice Department into blocking AT T s acquisition of Time Warner Does Big Tech need a Glass Steagall law After the Great Depression  the Glass Steagall Act forced lenders to separate their commercial and investment banking operations  Now  Representative David Cicilline  who leads the House antitrust subcommittee  wonders if something similar could apply to tech  It s an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information   a Glass Steagall for the international  tech companies  Mr  Cicilline told the FT His views hold weight  Mr  Cicilline has been an outspoken voice in the Democratic Party about tech regulation   he previously said that  Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself    and his committee position is a powerful one Others in Washington are making similar noises  Last week  the F T C  announced a new Big Tech task force  and its director of competition  Bruce Hoffman  said that some companies could be forced to  spin off  previous acquisitions Defending share buybacksLawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to limit companies  ability to buy back their shares  But Josh Bolten  the C E O  of the Business Roundtable  and Ken Bertsch  the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors  write in an NYT Op Ed that such efforts could hurt the economy   Restricting buybacks and dividends  the two write  could force companies  to sit on cash or waste it on projects with a low potential for success     Some critics of buybacks miss this point  Money returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends does not disappear from the economy   Mr  Bolten and Mr  Bertsch add  citing individuals making big purchases  angel investments in new businesses and loans as potential uses of such cash    While there was a substantial increase in buybacks and dividends last year  business investment also increased substantially and grew at the fastest rate since 2011     Not only do buybacks and dividends support a stronger and more dynamic economy  they also contribute to Americans  retirement security   Mr  Bolten and Mr  Bertsch write  citing widespread stock ownership in American households   The two concede that buybacks could be abused and advocate companies having strong corporate governance  But they argue federal limitations  would stifle innovation and opportunity in America  ImageCreditJeenah Moon ReutersWas Google really underpaying men A recent Google study into pay equality at the company found   to the surprise of just about everyone   that men were paid less than women for doing similar work  Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT writes    The study  which disproportionately led to pay raises for thousands of men  is done every year     In response to the study  Google gave  9 7 million in additional compensation to 10 677 employees for this year  Men account for about 69 percent of the company s work force  but they received a higher percentage of the money     Critics said the results of the pay study could give a false impression  Company officials acknowledged that it did not address whether women were hired at a lower pay grade than men with similar qualifications     A more difficult issue to solve   one that critics say Google often mismanages for women   is a human resources concept called

WASHINGTON   Federal regulators moved on Wednesday to ease oversight of the country s largest banks and other financial firms  continuing a push by the Trump administration to reverse rules that were put in place following the 2008 financial crisis The Federal Reserve said it would adjust the structure of its annual  stress tests   which measure the ability of leading banks to withstand a potential economic or financial storm  The changes are likely to make it easier for banks to get regulatory approval to pay higher dividends or buy back their own shares Separately  a federal oversight panel announced that it planned to no longer designate big  non bank financial institutions   insurers  asset managers and the like   as  systemically important   The classification subjected such firms to more intrusive government regulation Taken together  the announcements on Wednesday represented a big win for the financial industry  which has been arguing since the Obama administration that a flurry of regulations imposed following the financial crisis were onerous and made it harder for banks to make loans and support economic growth  Bank executives also argue that because the industry is much financially stronger than it was a decade ago many recent regulations are now unnecessary  Today s actions reflect the stability of the financial system and the Fed s growing experience with stress testing   said Jeff Sigmund  a spokesman for the American Bankers Association  which represents the nation s largest banks Critics  however  argued that the relaxation of the rules  while financially beneficial to bank shareholders and executives  will lead to a less safe  less transparent financial system that is more vulnerable to a repeat of last decade s devastating crisis  It s like if we all had to go to gym class and we all had to do the same things  now they re saying half of you don t even have to go  and the other half that have to go can do something easier   said Christopher Wolfe  a managing director at Fitch Ratings  which evaluates the creditworthiness of big companies   It s just another data point that reinforces the view that there s been a regulatory easing  The Trump administration has said that deregulation is a top priority  along with tax cuts and overhauling trade agreements  in its efforts to accelerate economic growth Soon after taking office  President Trump directed the Treasury Department to produce a series of reports with recommendations for regulatory changes  including watering down the 2010 Dodd Frank Act and the Volcker Rule  which barred banks from making trades with their own money In recent months  Fed officials have signaled growing interest in reassessing and lightening the regulatory burdens faced by big banks Jerome H  Powell  the Fed chairman  said during his Senate confirmation hearings that regulations on Wall Street banks were  tough enough  and suggested an appetite for streamlining post crisis rules  Late last year  Randal K  Quarles  the Fed s vice chairman for supervision  called for a more tailored approach to regulating financial institutions and suggested that the Fed might loosen rules governing the safety of their balance sheets The move on Wednesday by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to no longer treat non banks as systemically important is largely symbolic Only four financial institutions  including American International Group and MetLife  previously had that  too big to fail  designation  All of them argued successfully for the labels to be removed  Prudential Financial was the final firm to escape from the tougher regulation  after the oversight council concluded last fall that it no longer represented a threat to financial stability Going forward  the oversight panel said it would introduce a new system for identifying activities and products that could pose broad risks  The council said it would only designate a firm as  systemically important  if there was no other way to curb the risk it poses to the financial system by addressing its activities  Today s proposal would make significant improvements to how the council identifies  assesses  and responds to potential risks to U S  financial stability   Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  said in a statement The bigger change is the Fed s adjustments to how it conducts its stress tests of 11 of the biggest banks that received government bailouts in 2008 The Fed said on Wednesday that it would end its practice of awarding  pass  or  fail  grades to banks on a portion of the stress tests that measured the capacity of banks to keep lending during a financial crisis or economic downturn  This so called qualitative section of the test also measured the strength of their risk management and anti money laundering systems The stress tests will still have a pass fail component when it comes to gauging whether they have enough capital to keep functioning properly during a simulated financial emergency Bank executives have been exasperated by the stress tests  complaining that the qualitative section in particular relies on regulators  subjective judgment The Fed s planned changes are  an attempt to be sensitive to how time consuming and resource oriented these regulatory testing processes are   said Evan Stewart  a partner at the law firm Cohen   Gresser The stress tests have tripped up a number of big banks  The Fed in 2014 shot down Citigroup s plans to return money to shareholders after it failed the qualitative section  The following year  Deutsche Bank and the Spanish bank Santander failed  while Bank of America barely eked out a passing grade The end of the pass fail grades  reduces transparency and deprives the public of the ability to hold the banks and regulators accountable   said Dennis Kelleher  president of Better Markets  a financial industry watchdog group   The markets are not going to have the full picture

VANCOUVER  British Columbia   When the Chinese tech executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested by the Canadian authorities in the Vancouver airport while changing flights  she suddenly became one of the world s most famous detainees Her December arrest   made at the United States  request for her extradition on fraud charges   provoked a storm of recriminations from China  landed Ms  Meng in legal limbo  and put Canada in the middle of a fight between two world powers that are both rivals and trading partners Since then  relations between China and Canada have become increasingly strained  and China has arrested two Canadians  accusing them of espionage  and sentenced a third to death on a drug charge On Wednesday  the next chapter in Ms  Meng s case opened with an extradition proceeding at the Supreme Court of British Columbia  A hearing was set for May 8 to discuss next steps in the case  Chief among them will be setting a date for an extradition hearing to decide whether she should be sent to face fraud charges in the United States Ms  Meng  dressed casually in a sweatshirt with a simple clip in her hair  appeared composed as she sat in the courtroom next to an interpreter  She joined the large group of journalists  supporters and curious members of the public assembled in the courtroom as they bowed to the judge as the proceeding began Highlighting what he called the extraordinary context of the case  Richard Peck  a member of Ms  Meng s defense team  said there were concerns about its  political character   alluding to comments by President Trump that he was willing to intercede in the proceedings As the case moves forward  here s what you need to know Who is Meng Wanzhou A polished executive  Ms  Meng  46  is the chief financial officer of the Chinese tech giant Huawei  and the eldest daughter of its founder  Ren Zhengfei Ms  Meng  who also uses the names Sabrina and Cathy  was born in the western city of Chengdu  A high school dropout  she went on to get a master s degree  began at Huawei as a secretary and eventually rose to become a public face of the company ImageMeng Wanzhou  Huawei s chief financial officer  was arrested by Canadian authorities in December CreditAlexander Bibik ReutersMs  Meng was an important figure at Huawei as it rapidly expanded  Her job included announcing its financial results and speaking at public events around the world She was arrested  on Dec  1 at the request of the United States  which asked for her extradition and accused her of fraud She has been  awaiting her extradition hearing in Vancouver  where she and her husband own two expensive homes  She was released on bail of  10 million Canadian dollars  and is relatively free to roam about the city  although under 24 hour surveillance and wearing a GPS tracker on her ankle During her bail hearing  her lawyer told the court that  during her detention  she was considering studying for a doctorate in business administration and hoped to spend time with her family Her detainment has prompted an outpouring of support in China  where many people see her as a hostage What is the case against her Huawei has become the world s largest supplier of the equipment that underlies the world s wireless networks  The United States  however  has repeatedly accused the company of stealing technology from its Western rivals and believes its close ties to the Chinese government make it a threat to national security In January  the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment that  among other things  accuses Ms  Meng of fraudulently deceiving four banks so that Huawei could evade American sanctions against Iran It also accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and obstructing a criminal investigation into what it said was the company s effort to avoid those sanctions by destroying or concealing evidence What is expected to happen at her extradition hearing in Canada Legal experts say Ms  Meng is likely to be extradited  though it could take months for the courts to reach a final decision  Wednesday s hearing is the first step Joanna Harrington  a professor of law at the University of Alberta  noted that Canada has a track record of granting about 90 percent of extradition requests ImageA sign in support of Ms  Meng outside a court in Vancouver CreditDavid Ryder ReutersAlso  Canada usually grants extradition requests from democratic allies like the United States At the hearing  the judge will examine whether the fraud that Ms  Meng is charged with in the United States is also a crime in Canada  The judge cannot refuse to extradite her on the grounds that the case will not succeed at trial Ms  Meng s defense lawyers have already said that the charges are politically motivated  which could potentially help her in the extradition case  Mr  Trump may have given credence to this argument when he said he was willing to intercede in the case if that helped achieve a trade deal with China Assuming the court does decide to extradite her  the matter would then be referred to the country s recently appointed justice minister  David Lametti  a former law professor at McGill University in Montreal who specialized in intellectual property After that  Ms  Meng could appeal through the Canadian courts How has the case affected Canada Chinese relations From the day of Ms  Meng s arrest  Canada has said it was legally bound to detain her at the request of its ally  Beijing sees it differently Shortly after her arrest  the Chinese authorities arrested two Canadians  Michael Kovrig  a former diplomat  and Michael Spavor  a businessman  Just days after Canada approved Ms  Meng s extradition hearing  the Chinese government accused them of espionage The two men have been held in secret detention sites in China with no access to lawyers or visits from their families A third Canadian  Robert Lloyd Schellenberg  was sentenced in January to death for drug smuggling All three cases have caused alarm in Canada  where many have pointed to Ms  Meng s comparatively cushy detainment Adding to the acrimony  lawyers for Ms  Meng announced over the weekend that they would sue members of the Canadian Border Services Agency  the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the federal government for breaching her constitutional rights when she was detained for three hours in December before being formally arrested Despite the tensions  the economic ties between the two countries have persevered  Canadians continue to buy Chinese products  including Huawei smartphones  and the Chinese continue to gobble up

BEIJING   China s premier said on Tuesday that his government would respond to an economic slowdown by cutting taxes  easing burdens on the private sector and giving markets a bigger role   diluting the heavily pro state pronouncements and policies that critics have warned were scaring investors Calling 2019 a  crucial year  for China s economy  Premier Li Keqiang  the second ranking official in China after President Xi Jinping  laid out measures long supported by private businesses  Mr  Li s annual report to the national legislature revived rhetoric about market solutions after the government faced growing criticism for favoring government initiatives and state owned companies  squeezing out private enterprise  We will keep using market oriented reforming thinking   Mr  Li said in his report   The government must act with resolve to hand matters it shouldn t manage over to the market  But the specifics of his speech to the legislature did not go as far as domestic or foreign critics would have liked  And this year s session of China s Communist Party controlled legislature  the National People s Congress  underscored how much economic anxieties have come to dominate policy a year after Mr  Xi appeared politically indomitable The nearly 3 000 congress delegates meet once a year to loyally approve legislation  reports and budgets  Last year  Mr  Xi  who is also the party leader  used the meeting to entrench his power  pushing through changes to the Constitution that abolished a term limit on the presidency  That meeting also approved a broad restructuring of the government and established a new anticorruption agency But the triumphant glow of Mr  Xi s victory last March has dimmed  Mr  Li echoed the somber tone of Mr  Xi s recent comments about the year ahead  which is dotted with sensitive anniversaries   above all  30 years since the armed crackdown of June 3 to 4  1989  on pro democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square in Beijing Mr  Li made little mention of the trade frictions with the Trump administration  But he stressed the risks facing China  We will face a graver and more complicated environment  as well as risks and challenges   Mr  Li said   We must be fully prepared for a tough struggle  ImageA media tour of the new Beijing Daxing International Airport  which is scheduled to be completed in June  June will also mark 30 years since the Tiananmen Square crackdown  one of the sensitive anniversaries in China in 2019 CreditKevin Frayer Getty ImagesThe Chinese economy has slowed sharply since summer  mainly because of tight restrictions imposed on lending a year ago to curb debt  The trade war with the United States has also damaged the confidence of businesses and consumers  making entrepreneurs less willing to invest in export factories and consumers less eager to buy big ticket items like apartments and new cars  This was not a leadership that appeared strong and decisive with a clear vision   said Elizabeth C  Economy  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and the author of  The Third Revolution   which studied Mr  Xi s years in power Besides slowing growth  she said  China s leaders must contend with rising household debt  the failure of looser birth restrictions to slow the aging crisis and growing shortfalls in the pension system Mr  Li laid out how the government intends to turn around some of those problems He set an ambitious target for economic growth this year of 6 to 6 5 percent  That allows for slightly slower expansion than last year s target of about 6 5 percent  Growth of China s gross domestic product for 2018 came in at 6 6 percent  Many Western economists suspect that Chinese statistics may overestimate recent growth  however The three main choices for maintaining high growth have been to further ramp up spending on roads  bridges  rail lines and other infrastructure  to print more money and force banks to lend more  or to cut taxes and deregulate The government has been slow to cut taxes or deregulate  preferring to maintain its revenues and control  But many tycoons want lower taxes  In his report  Mr  Li also said the government would reduce the burden on employers from social insurance and old age insurance for workers  Tax cuts and fee reductions get right to the spot in tackling the pains and difficulties  currently troubling businesses  he said Mr  Li also promised to cut taxes a year ago  But economists believe that much of the effect of the nominal cuts was offset by stricter collection  The more tax we have  the heavier our burden will be when we go overseas and go into battle   said Liu Hanyuan  the chairman of Tongwei Group  a conglomerate making everything from fish food to solar panels ImagePeople s Liberation Army soldiers marching at Tiananmen Square on Saturday  Mr  Li revealed that China will continue to spend heavily to modernize its military  although at a slightly lower pace than last year CreditRoman Pilipey EPA  via ShutterstockIn the past decade  Beijing turned to huge  debt fueled investments in infrastructure and big increases in the money supply each time that the economy appeared to be slowing more than the country s leaders could tolerate  The infrastructure investments have given China one of the world s finest transportation networks But many companies and local governments are now struggling to pay all the debt they have accumulated  Rapid increases in mortgages and the broader money supply have driven the prices of apartments skyward  far beyond what most young people can afford  Real estate prices have jumped more than tenfold in the past two decades in many towns and cities China s leaders set out at the start of last year to reduce debt   only to find that the economy slowed markedly by June  In July  President Trump began in earnest a trade war with China  By autumn  business and investor confidence had plummeted  investment in new factories and other equipment was stalling  and car sales were in a nose dive The government responded this winter by again ramping up infrastructure spending and debt  A broad measure of debt known as total social financing posted a record jump in January Total debt has not come down the way Chinese officials hoped a year ago  But China has made progress by cracking down hard on the barely regulated shadow banking system  while encouraging a big increase in the sale of bonds by local governments and corporations Relying more on bonds now means a less opaque system that may be a little less prone to sudden financial panics  But it has exposed another problem  Most small and medium size enterprises are not large enough or profitable enough to issue bonds  These enterprises create 90 percent of the new jobs in China  but the state controlled banking system has long been reluctant to lend to them The annual work report by China s premier  delivered in a very long speech in the Great Hall of the People  resembles in some ways the State of the Union address that the president of the United States delivers to Congress each year Mr  Li had little new to say about foreign policy or domestic political threats  But the proposed budget released at the same time as his speech revealed that China would continue to spend heavily to modernize its military  although at a slightly lower pace than last year  Military spending in 2019 would rise by 7 5 percent to about  178 billion  the budget showed  Last year  the military budget grew by 8 1 percent  The world today faces profound changes of a kind unseen in a century   Mr  Li said in his speech 
WASHINGTON   The National Security Agency has quietly shut down a system that analyzes logs of Americans  domestic calls and texts  according to a senior Republican congressional aide  halting a program that has touched off disputes about privacy and the rule of law since the Sept  11 attacks The agency has not used the system in months  and the Trump administration might not ask Congress to renew its legal authority  which is set to expire at the end of the year  according to the aide  Luke Murry  the House minority leader s national security adviser In a raw assertion of executive power  President George W  Bush s administration started the program as part of its intense pursuit for Qaeda conspirators in the weeks after the 2001 terrorist attacks  and a court later secretly blessed it  The intelligence contractor Edward J  Snowden disclosed the program s existence in 2013  jolting the public and contributing to growing awareness of how both governments and private companies harvest and exploit personal data The way that intelligence analysts have gained access to bulk records of Americans  phone calls and texts has evolved  but the purpose has been the same  They analyze social links to hunt for associates of known terrorism suspects Intelligence agencies can use the technique on data obtained through other means  like collection from networks abroad  where there are fewer legal limits  But those approaches do not offer the same systematic access to domestic phone records Congress ended and replaced the program disclosed by Mr  Snowden with the U S A  Freedom Act of 2015  which will expire in December  Security and privacy advocates have been gearing up for a legislative battle over whether to extend or revise the program   and with what changes  if any Mr  Murry  who is an adviser for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  raised doubts over the weekend about whether that debate will be necessary  His remarks came during a podcast for the national security website Lawfare Mr  Murry brought up the pending expiration of the Freedom Act  but then disclosed that the Trump administration  hasn t actually been using it for the past six months   I m actually not certain that the administration will want to start that back up   Mr  Murry said He referred to problems that the National Security Agency disclosed last year   Technical irregularities  had contaminated the agency s database with message logs it had no authority to collect  so officials purged hundreds of millions of call and text records gathered from American telecommunications firms The agency declined to comment on Monday  Press officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment Matt Sparks  a spokesman for Mr  McCarthy s office  said late Monday that Mr  Murry  was not speaking on behalf of administration policy or what Congress intends to do on this issue  Christopher Augustine  an N S A  spokesman  told The New York Times in January that agency officials were  carefully evaluating all aspects  of the Freedom Act program  and were discussing its future Mr  Augustine made clear that the White House would make the final call about whether to ask Congress to extend the Freedom Act The disclosure that the program has apparently been shut down for months  changes the entire landscape of the debate   said Daniel Schuman  the policy director of Demand Progress  an advocacy group that focuses on civil liberties and government accountability Since  the sky hasn t fallen  without the program  he said  the intelligence community must make the case that reviving it is necessary   if  indeed  the National Security Agency thinks it is worth the effort to keep trying to make it work The phone records program had never thwarted a terrorist attack  a fact that emerged during the post Snowden debate  If there is an ongoing program  even if we all have doubts about it  that s a very different political matter than if the program has actually stopped   Mr  Schuman said   Then the question becomes   Why restart it   rather than whether to turn it off  The National Security Agency has used the call detail records   metadata showing who called whom and when  but not the content of what was said   as a map of social networks  analyzing links between people to identify associates of terrorism suspects Even without the program  the agency could still collect telecommunications data from abroad  which domestic surveillance laws have left largely unregulated  But while overseas based collection can give some access to Americans  data  it apparently does not provide the systematic access to purely domestic phone messages The phone records program traces back to the aftermath of the Sept  11 attacks when the Bush administration created the secret Stellarwind surveillance program  One component involved the bulk collection of logs of Americans  domestic phone calls Companies like AT T and MCI   later part of Verizon   initially turned over their customers  records in response to an order by Mr  Bush  Starting in 2006  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court began issuing secret orders requiring the companies to participate  based on a novel interpretation of Section 215 of the Patriot Act  which said the F B I  may obtain business records  relevant  to a terrorism investigation In June 2013  the program came to light after The Guardian published the first revelation from the trove of classified files provided by Mr  Snowden  a top secret surveillance court order to Verizon to provide its customers  call records The disclosure  one of the most significant by Mr  Snowden  prompted sharp criticism of the government s theory about why it was legal  Essentially  everyone s phone records were relevant because the government needed to acquire the haystack so that it could hunt for needles of investigative interest  An appeals court later rejected that theory While intelligence officials could not point to attacks the program had thwarted  they defended the ability as a useful triaging tool for sifting through potential connections   and suggested that had it been in place before Sept  11  it might have helped uncover Al Qaeda s plot  Critics called that argument exaggerated and portrayed it as a legally dubious invasion of privacy that was ripe for abuse The Obama administration eventually embraced a plan to end the National Security Agency s bulk collection of domestic phone data but preserve the old program s analytical ability  resulting in the Freedom Act of 2015 Under that law  the bulk records remained in the hands of the phone companies  not the government  But with a judge s permission  the agency could swiftly retrieve the phone and text logs of particular suspects as well as of all of the people who had been in contact with those suspects  even when they were customers of different phone companies Under the replacement system  the number of records about Americans  communications that the agency collected dropped significantly from the billions per day it had previously been sucking in Yet the scale of collection remained huge  The program gathered 151 million records in 2016  despite obtaining court orders to use the system on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016  along with a few left over from late 2015  In 2017  it obtained orders for 40 targets and collected 534 million records Problems with the system emerged last year  when the National Security Agency said it had decided to delete its entire database of records gathered since the Freedom Act system became operational  Glenn S  Gerstell  the agency s general counsel  said in an interview at the time that because of complex technical glitches  one or more telecom providers   he declined to say which   had responded to court orders for records by sending logs to the agency that included both accurate and inaccurate data When the agency then fed those numbers back to the telecoms to get the communications logs of all of the people who had been in contact with its targets  it ended up gathering some data of people unconnected to the targets  The agency had no authority to collect their information  nor a practical way to go through its large database and cull those records it should not have gathered  As a result  it decided to purge them all and start over But it had not been clear until Mr  Murry s comments in the podcast that was posted over the weekend that the problems have continued  even as a legislative battle over the Freedom Act   and the inevitable scrutiny of how the program has functioned   has drawn near 
The House Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating allegations of voter suppression in Georgia under Secretary of State Brian Kemp  who has since become governor The investigation was revealed in letters that the committee s Democratic leaders sent on Wednesday to Mr  Kemp and his successor as secretary of state  Brad Raffensperger  The letters instructed Mr  Kemp and Mr  Raffensperger   both Republicans   to provide by March 20 a wide range of documents concerning voter roll purges  holds placed on voter registration applications  polling site changes and closings  and other voting related issues The committee also requested all documents related to the potential conflict of interest Mr  Kemp faced in administering an election in which he was a candidate  The Committee is particularly concerned by reports that Georgians faced unprecedented challenges with registering to vote and significant barriers to casting their votes during your tenure as secretary of state and during the 2018 election   Representatives Elijah E  Cummings  the committee chairman  and Jamie Raskin  head of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  wrote to Mr  Kemp Mr  Kemp and Republicans on the committee immediately dismissed the investigation as a political effort  aimed at undermining the results of an election that Democrats lost  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  The letter outlined several points of scrutiny during the 2018 governor s race  in which Stacey Abrams  a Democrat  posed a strong challenge to Mr  Kemp in a normally solidly Republican state Many voters  especially in heavily African American counties  waited at polling places for hours while  hundreds of available voting machines sat unused in government warehouses   the letter noted  State officials had sequestered those machines in response to a federal lawsuit that said they were vulnerable to hacking Tens of thousands of voter registration applications  mostly from African Americans  were held up under a state law that requires the name on the application to exactly match the name on the applicant s government ID  even a missing hyphen can cause problems Mr  Kemp s office purged more than 1 4 million voters from the rolls during his tenure   States are required to keep their rolls up to date and remove people who have moved  but some  including Georgia  have been much more zealous than others  starting the purging process on the basis of a voter not having cast a ballot recently   And county and state officials closed more than 200 polling places from 2012 to 2018 Throughout the campaign  Mr  Kemp denied intentional voter suppression  Asked for comment on Wednesday  his spokesman directed The Times to video of a news conference where Mr  Kemp suggested that the investigation was a politically motivated distraction from more important issues  They need to quit playing politics up there   Mr  Kemp said at the news conference  before pivoting to an attack on House Democrats for giving billions of dollars in disaster aid to Puerto Rico  when we have our own farmers that are fixing to lose their farm   He said nothing about the substance of the allegations or the document requests  and his spokesman did not respond to a follow up email Mr  Raffensperger  the current secretary of state  said that he had received his own letter and that his office  looks forward to an open dialogue and a thorough process  Mr  Cummings and Mr  Raskin  the Democratic committee leaders  were not immediately available for interviews on Wednesday  But their decision to open the investigation was more evidence that House Democrats  newly empowered by the November election  intend to act aggressively on issues like allegations of voter suppression that were on the back burner for the first two years of the Trump administration Representative Jim Jordan  the committee s ranking Republican  said through a spokesman that it was  highly unusual for a congressional committee to involve itself in a state s election   This is squarely in the purview of the state of Georgia  not the House Oversight Committee   Mr  Jordan said in a statement   We can t help but think that attempts by the Democrats to insert the committee into the state s business is an attempt to relitigate an election result that they do not like  Mr  Kemp narrowly defeated Ms  Abrams  who ended her campaign by declaring   This is not a speech of concession  because concession means to acknowledge an action is right  true or proper

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  The morning after protests roiled Sacramento and local clergy implored him to do the opposite  Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced that he would not bring criminal charges against the two officers who shot and killed Stephon Clark  a 22 year old black man  in his grandmother s backyard about a year ago  Our investigation can t change what has happened   he said Mr  Becerra s announcement yesterday came days after the Sacramento district attorney  Anne Marie Schubert  said her office wouldn t prosecute the officers  though Mr  Becerra said the two offices came to their conclusions independently Mr  Clark s death has been a flash point in California  where it s the latest version of a tragic story line that has played out across the country  An unarmed young black man is killed by police officers who said they believed he had a gun and believed their lives were in danger Here s what you need to know about the case What s next  The legal fights are far from over  In January  Mr  Clark s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city and the two officers And the federal authorities announced later on Tuesday that they would investigate whether Mr  Clark s civil rights had been violated Also  after protests on Monday night ended in 84 arrests of demonstrators and the detainment of a longtime Sacramento Bee reporter  Mayor Darrell Steinberg directed the city s public safety accountability office to investigate what happened  Protesters said they d been effectively tricked and trapped by police officers when they said they were trying to get to cars to leave Protests were expected to continue Tuesday night What does this mean for the attorney general  Mr  Becerra has a powerful  high profile elected office in a progressive state   an office that has historically been a springboard for leaders with even bigger political ambitions  like former Gov  Jerry Brown and Senator Kamala Harris But while Mr  Becerra has become well known for leading the state s fights against President Trump s agenda  suing the administration now 47 times  he s been less aggressive about policing the police  as CALmatters put it Recently  he s taken heat for not ruling out legal action against journalists who got a list of police officers who had been convicted of crimes through a public records request This all comes amid growing discussion about what truly progressive criminal justice policies look like  The question of whether Mr  Becerra s predecessor  Ms  Harris  can effectively pitch herself as a  progressive prosecutor  has been up for intense debate as she runs for president  If you missed it  here s The Times s comprehensive analysis of police

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  The day s top stories   Attorney General Xavier Becerra added one more lawsuit yesterday to the several dozen he s filed against the Trump administration  This one aims to block moves that would effectively strip millions of dollars in federal funding from reproductive health care providers that perform abortions or abortion referrals For those still keeping count  the total is now  47  It s a figure that has placed Mr  Becerra squarely at the center of California s resistance  along with Gov  Gavin Newsom  who s also taken rhetorical aim at the president s policies on immigration and the environment Last night  the police detained a longtime Sacramento Bee reporter and arrested dozens of demonstrators

political consequences And here s another one worth thinking about ImageFrom left  Mohammad Al Faruque  associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science  Arnav Malawade  a graduate

around the state  scientists are working to solve the universe s toughest puzzles  or hurtling toward world changing discoveries Recently  I talked to a team of researchers at U C  Irvine and U C  Riverside who managed to make a finding that could be world changing   and it s kind of terrifying It s possible to record the subtle sounds of a DNA synthesis machine working in a lab and then reverse engineer whatever genetic materials the machine is making In other words  it s possible to hack such a machine by  in effect  listening to it The idea for the project  said Mohammad Al Faruque  an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at U C I   stemmed from his previous work stealing blueprints for things printed by a 3 D printer  If you can eavesdrop on a machine  you can understand what it s making   he said   And with the 3 D printer  we demonstrated that  But if what you re stealing is a genetic blueprint  the stakes are much higher  It could be health information or pharmaceuticals   or the recipe for a biological weapon Philip Brisk  a U C  Riverside associate professor of computer science and engineering  said that because Microsoft was working on DNA data storage  the finding could have implications for information security And William Grover  a U C  Riverside assistant professor of bioengineering  said that while not everybody has a 3 D printer or a DNA synthesizer  lots of people have Alexas or Google Homes  Everybody makes noises in their day to day business  which can be vulnerable to side channel attacks   he said  And medical machines like the ones in health care offices also make noise Still  before you get the urge to wrap your house in tinfoil  team members said the research was encouraging First  Mr  Al Faruque said  as engineering as a discipline undergoes  a paradigm shift   research is the result of a new kind of collaboration that will be necessary to solve increasingly multifaceted problems  The team  for example  needed bioengineering experts as well as computer engineers  We had the right grouping of players   he said Second  doing research that highlights vulnerabilities makes it possible to design products with solutions in mind Mr  Brisk said that right now  cost is often the top priority in designing labs and products  But this kind of research  he said  forces designers and engineers to pay attention to security  too  You could optimize so that there s less information bouncing around   he said   I m sure the right type of engineering expertise exists somewhere  Here s what else

WASHINGTON   Scott Gottlieb  the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration  known for his aggressive efforts to regulate the tobacco and e cigarette industries  said on Tuesday that he would resign at the end of the month The reason he gave was family and his weariness with commuting to see his wife and three children  who have remained in their Westport  Conn  home since he took office  But his announcement caught many in Washington and the industries he regulates by surprise and raised questions about whether his push to reduce teenage vaping and lower nicotine levels and ban menthol in cigarettes will continue in an administration that generally has a hands off approach to business  It s critical that his successor champions protecting kids and the rest of the nation against the tobacco epidemic   said Cliff Douglas  vice president of tobacco control at the American Cancer Society   Gottlieb has taken historic steps to take on this epidemic in a new way  including such proposals as reducing nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels and now pursuing a potential ban on menthol in cigarettes  so it is critical that whoever succeeds him picks up that mantel and treats it with equal priority that he has given it  Dr  Gottlieb has been subject to increasing pressure from some Republicans in Congress and his former associates in the conservative movement for his tough stance against youth vaping and traditional cigarettes  A coalition of influential conservative groups recently asked the White House to block some key parts of the F D A  s strategy to prevent youths from vaping  Republican Senator Richard Burr blasted the commissioner on the Senate floor for his proposal to ban menthol cigarettes Dr  Gottlieb said these protests had no role in his departure  There s no intrigue here   he said in an interview  A senior White House official said Dr  Gottlieb was not pressured to leave and that the President was  very fond  of him Dr  Gottlieb said he planned to advance the F D A  s pending tobacco regulations before he leaves  And he was confident  he said  that the agency s guidance on restricting flavored e cigarettes would be issued before he left  He acknowledged  however  that he could not predict the fate of his proposals to ban menthol in cigarettes and reduce nicotine to nonaddictive levels in cigarettes Industry analysts expressed optimism that those initiatives would  in fact  now end  We think this major development will be broadly viewed as a positive for the tobacco industry  although this introduces some uncertainty   Bonnie Herzog  a managing director of equity research at Wells Fargo Securities  wrote in an email to clients   We believe his resignation calls into question whether or not the FDA will in fact enforce harsher regulations around youth e cig usage access  cig nicotine limits and a cig menthol ban given he was the champion behind these initiatives  When he was first nominated  Dr  Gottlieb seemed a figure right out of central casting for the Trump administration  As a venture capitalist who served as both a consultant and board member for drug companies  he had made a fortune from the industry he would regulate  written impassioned anti regulatory columns in conservative journals  and held stock in industry players large and small  which he divested  But he was also a physician  and as he settled into the job  his libertarian views were often balanced by his zeal to protect public health  He was remarkably successful at keeping the agency moving forward at a difficult time and really focused on public health challenges  including the opioid epidemic and drug prices    said Dr  Joshua M  Sharfstein  a former principal deputy commissioner at the F D A  during the Obama administration  who is now a professor of health policy at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health   He surprised a lot of people in his willingness to take some risks for public health  Under Dr  Gottlieb s leadership  the F D A  approved a record number of generic medicines  new drugs  and medical devices  He led the agency into unusual territory  calling for lower drug prices and speaking out about the opioid crisis But his record on opioids was mixed  some policy experts said  Although the agency worked to take one powerful addictive painkiller  Opana ER  off the market  it approved Dsuvia  a new form of an extremely potent opioid  for acute pain   which public health advocates feared would be just as dangerous Ryan Hampton  who advocates for people recovering from addictions and who has testified before Congress  recently helped launch a campaign   Wake Up F D A    to protest the agency s approval of Dsuvia  while being slow to approve new medications to treat addiction  though Dr  Gottlieb spoke often about the importance of doing so  The ideal response would be not to bring more dangerous opioids to the market in the midst of a public health crisis   Mr  Hampton said of the F D A  under Dr  Gottlieb   That was a huge red flag and lapse in judgment on Gottlieb s part  Once that happened  folks in the recovery community lost confidence in Gottlieb and the F D A  Likewise  the F D A  s speedy approval of many medical devices was praised by the growing industry  but has drawn strong protests from many people who believe the rate of approval has been too rapid to ensure safety  He also worked to better track outbreaks of food borne illness  and to boost new treatments like gene therapy and targeted medicine During his tenure at the F D A   Dr  Gottlieb  who was not shy about announcing his achievements  sometimes several times a day on social media  eventually moved from a hands off approach to the nascent e cigarette companies  to leading a clamorous fight against them  particularly as studies emerged about how teenagers swarmed the new product  unaware of the addictive properties of nicotine In shifting his position  from giving the companies years to show that e cigarettes were both safe and effective for smoking cessation  to urging stringent monitoring of convenience stores  vaping flavors and age restrictions  Dr  Gottlieb earned both the umbrage of pro business leaders and some aspersions from the antismoking movement  which felt he moved too slowly Matthew L  Myers  president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids  acknowledged that Dr  Gottlieb walked a tightrope  leaving a complex record in his wake   He has made proposals that had the potential to reduce tobacco use more dramatically than any other federal public official in U S  history   Mr  Myers said   On e cigarettes he deserves enormous credit for shining a spotlight on the crisis of its use by kids   But   Mr  Myers continued   the fact that he has not prohibited the marketing of the flavored products outright has contributed to the problem  His legacy will depend upon whether his proposals  including those for e cigarettes  ultimately become law  And the landmark tobacco regulation plan  announced in July 2017  has lagged in some important areas  After the tobacco industry sent thousands of letters against reducing nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels  that plan has stalled  The proposal to eliminate menthol in cigarettes has not yet been formalized  Dr  Gottlieb s early decision to give e cigarette companies more time to comply with new  tougher regulations is viewed by many as having opened the door to the youth vaping epidemic 
Three years ago this month  as alarms about the over prescription of opioid painkillers were sounding across the country  the federal government issued course correcting guidelines for primary care doctors  Prescriptions have fallen notably since then  and the Trump administration is pushing for them to drop by another third by 2021 But in a letter to be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday  more than 300 medical experts  including three former White House drug czars  contend that the guidelines are harming one group of vulnerable patients  those with severe chronic pain  who may have been taking high doses of opioids for years without becoming addicted  They say the guidelines are being used as cover by insurers to deny reimbursement and by doctors to turn patients away  As a result  they say  patients who could benefit from the medications are being thrown into withdrawal and suffering renewed pain and a diminished quality of life  even to the point of suicide The letter writers form an uneasy alliance spanning differing positions on opioids   professors of addiction medicine as well as pain specialists  some patient representatives who have taken money from the pharmaceutical industry  and the former drug czars  from the Obama  Clinton and Nixon administrations Michael Botticelli  who served as the drug czar under President Obama and now leads the Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center  said he signed the letter because  there has been enough anecdotal evidence to raise the alarm bells  about the misuse of the guidelines leading to pain patients losing effective treatment  The C D C  really does need a rigorous evaluation of this because we don t know how big the problem is   he said   Minimally  we need some level of clarification on appropriate use of the guidelines  Specifically  the letter asks the C D C  to emphatically state that treatment decisions for these patients be left to their doctors  It is imperative that health care professionals and administrators realize that the guideline does not endorse mandated involuntary dose reduction or discontinuation   the group wrote in the letter  which it also sent to members of relevant congressional committees  A spokeswoman for the C D C   Julie Eschelbach  said the guidelines  do not endorse mandated or abrupt dose reduction or discontinuation   She added that the agency has several studies underway to examine the guidelines  impact  and has published a  pocket guide  for doctors on tapering The guidelines are nonbinding  but many of them have become enshrined in state regulations  Therefore  said Dr  Stefan G  Kertesz  an author of the letter who teaches addiction medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham   it s normal to say from the top   This needs a clarification because we don t want people hurt   Others say the problem lies not with the guidelines  which urge non opioid therapies as the first line treatment for chronic pain  but with their misapplication  What the guidelines are being blamed for versus what they actually recommend are two different things   said Dr  Thomas R  Frieden  who ran the C D C  when the guidelines were developed Experts in addiction medicine distinguish patients who need opioids for chronic pain from people addicted to the drugs  while some patients are physically dependent and will go into withdrawal if the drugs are withheld  the opioids help them function  despite severe pain  But just because you re on a higher dose doesn t mean you re addicted   said Dr  Daniel P  Alford  a professor who directs addiction medicine education at the Boston University School of Medicine  who signed the letter Addiction  he said  is  a behavioral maladaptation where the medication takes over their lives  and they continue to use despite negative consequences  The guidelines say doctors should discuss the costs of a high dose regimen with pain patients and press for a prudent taper  They do not say those patients  drugs should be summarily reduced  They advise doctors to prescribe opioids to new patients only for a short time  and with a daily dose below 90 morphine milligram equivalents  That recommendation has prompted many states and monitoring systems to impose a hard stop at that level for all patients except those with cancer or in end of life care  Who says that 90 is a magical threshold   Dr  Alford asked   There s no good evidence  Yes  we should avoid escalating doses  but how do we treat people who are already on high doses  Dr  Frieden defended 90 M M E   as the measurement is known  as a responsible ceiling   The death rates just go up exponentially   he said  for people on very high doses of opioids Dr  Frieden said more doctors should be allowed to get federal permission to prescribe buprenorphine  a lower risk opioid drug that can effectively manage opioid dependence while treating pain  as an alternative to more dangerous painkillers  Dr  Frieden was charged last summer with groping a woman  he pleaded not guilty and the case is still pending  The letter to the C D C  echoes a November resolution by the American Medical Association  which protested the  misapplication  of the guidelines  by pharmacists  health insurers  pharmacy benefit managers  legislatures  and governmental and private regulatory bodies in ways that prevent or limit access to opioid analgesia  A central question is how many patients have suffered from their doses being reduced or from being taken off opioids entirely   A report by the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that in 2016 about 500 000 beneficiaries of Medicare drug plans had been getting prescriptions of 120 M M E  or greater for three months or longer   a figure that doesn t fully capture the current affected population Accompanying the experts  letter are testimonials by hundreds of pain patients detailing struggles in the wake of the guidelines The opioid prescribing rate has been falling since 2012  but the amount prescribed per person is still about three times higher than it was in 1999  at the beginning of the addiction crisis  according to the C D C  While overdose deaths because of prescription opioids have begun leveling off  deaths from illicit fentanyl and its analogues increased by more than 45 percent in 2017 alone  a phenomenon that the letter writers attribute in part to the crackdown on pain pill prescriptions  Dr  John Brooklyn  who runs two large addiction treatment programs in Vermont  gave one example  A 61 year old patient  disabled by a back injury  had been functioning well for years on 225 M M E   he said  Invoking the guidelines  his pain doctor started cutting his dose by 40 milligrams a month  When he was at 120 M M E    said Dr  Brooklyn   he was in such severe pain that he was buying opioids on the street  He barely ate  lost 40 pounds  couldn t pay rent and then turned to cheap heroin  His doctor continued to reduce his dose and  at 30 M M E   the patient called our program  Dr  Brooklyn put the patient on methadone  a type of opioid approved to treat addiction as well as to manage chronic pain   It was like watering a dehydrated plant   he said Dr  Joanna L  Starrels  an associate professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and one of the experts who helped draft the C D C  guidelines  said chronic pain patients are an especially fragile group   Some with severe persistent pain are barely getting by   she said   They are sometimes homebound  unable to work or fully participate in most of the rewarding aspects of life   Their rates of depression are high  she said  and they have few reliable treatment alternatives Research that looks at the effect of dose reduction on such patients is in its infancy  she said  In fact the guidelines include a plea for research to evaluate their efficacy That the guidelines have had widespread impact is not in question  While a handful of hospital systems and states had adopted opioid prescription limits before 2016  the number of institutions have since shot up In its annual survey of hospital based pharmacies last year  the American Society of Health System Pharmacists asked about opioid monitoring for the first time  In preliminary results  41 percent said they had done so and some cited the C D C  guidelines By the end of 2016  seven states had passed legislation limiting opioid prescriptions  by October 2018  33 states had enacted laws with some type of limit  guidance or requirement related to opioids  according to the National Conference of State Legislatures Aetna  one of the country s largest health insurers  placed a limit of 90 M M E s per day on its members last year based on the C D C  guidelines  said Ethan Slavin  a company spokesman  The stricter daily limits  are part of our efforts to help reduce the potential for misuse and diversion of the drugs   he said  adding that prescribers who believe higher doses are needed can seek special permission by consulting with Aetna s experts A study last year found that insurers overall were not doing enough to increase access to alternative pain treatments  including therapeutic massage  acupuncture and non opioid drugs Dr  Anna Lembke  medical director of addiction medicine at Stanford  declined to sign the letter  saying the guidelines were sufficiently moderate The remedy to the problems detailed in the letter  she said  was to educate primary care doctors about how to provide  safe  compassionate  patient centered tapers when medically indicated   which can be a protracted  delicate process Dr  Kertesz acknowledged that tapering was a worthy goal   But more typically what we are seeing   he said   are people who report non consensual tapers  RelatedOpinion   Maia SzalavitzWhen the Cure Is Worse Than the DiseaseFeb  9  2019
Even after more than six months  Kirad wasn t used to sharing a bed with her mother  She was now 17  and ever since they arrived in New York after fleeing Honduras  they were stuck in the same room They were staying in a tiny bungalow in Far Rockaway  Queens  that belonged to Kirad s aunt  The only common space was a kitchen just big enough to squeeze in a love seat and a small table  Every surface was covered with pots and pans  cereal boxes and bags of food  We fight sometimes over the TV   Kirad said   because my mom wants to watch something and I want to watch something different so I go to my aunt s room  For the most part  they have made it work As cramped as it is in this tiny room  Kirad had hoped to have one more family member sharing this space  her older sister  Susan  She and her mother last saw Susan in July  when they crossed the Mexican border into Eagle Pass  Tex  The family of three was seeking asylum Kirad and her mother  Ana Batiz  were allowed to pursue their case in immigration court  and went on to New York  But Susan was not  She was sent back to Honduras by herself  I m sure my mother would sleep on the couch or on the floor or whatever for the three of us to be together   Kirad said  I have never been away from them   Ms  Batiz said of her daughters  This is a story about the brutal math that asylum seekers face at the border today  In this case  a mother and a daughter with virtually identical circumstances try to immigrate to the United States  Each has an interview with an asylum officer that could alter their lives forever  Read about a family s experiences in the hours before the father of five children is deported   One persuades her interviewer that returning to Honduras was too dangerous  she enters the country to pursue an asylum claim The other  an 18 year old  fails that same test  As a result  she is separated from her only family and sent back  alone  to an environment where she feels threatened every day ImageAna Batiz in New York  where she has lived since last summer as she makes her case for asylum When Ana Batiz and her daughters arrived at the border  she did not even realize they had crossed illegally  She said she did not know there was an official point of entry at Eagle Pass  she said  so they waded across the dangerous waters of the Rio Grande with other migrants Ms  Batiz left her small village on the Atlantic coast of Honduras with plans to seek asylum  because she was persecuted for having H I V   I don t think it s right   she said   for someone to tell you   You should die   The family did not join a caravan  She said they hitched rides with other Hondurans heading north  It all fell apart when they got to the Texas border  Ms  Batiz and her two daughters were taken to what immigrants call a hielera  Spanish for  icebox   a processing center run by Customs and Border Protection That night of their arrival at Eagle Pass  according to Kirad  border agents took Susan  along with about 10 others  all young men  out of the room   They told my mother that they were going to take me out and bring me right back   Susan recalled But she didn t return Long before the Trump administration s recent policy of separating migrant children from their parents  Customs and Border Protection agents have been taking children ages 18 and over away from their parents  This is because the agency considers them to be legal adults  who should be sent to adult detention centers instead of staying with families  With the current surge in families crossing the border  this means even more 18 year olds could find themselves separated from their parents  But there s a paradox here  Although Susan was considered an adult at the border  she would have been considered a child in the United States as an immigrant seeking asylum That s because older teens like Susan fall into conflicting categories under U S  immigration policies  The Immigration and Nationality Act defines anyone under 21 and unmarried as a child  U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services also uses this definition and allows children under 21 to accompany their parents to asylum interviews  These interviews are crucial because they determine whether a migrant can stay in the country and pursue their case in immigration court As an adult at the border  Susan had been separated from her family  so she couldn t attend her mother s asylum interview  She would have to fend for herself H I V  PersecutionImageMs  Batiz getting passport photos required for their immigration case Until 2010  people with H I V  were actually banned from entering the United States  When that changed  people with H I V  could also seek asylum in the U S  if they were persecuted for it in their home country  Ms  Batiz and her daughters made a strong case that they were  She has asked that we not use the last names of her daughters out of fear for their safety In their small Honduran town  Ms  Batiz s family was part of the Garifuna community  descendants of enslaved Africans and indigenous Central Americans  The Garifuna tend to be extremely poor  and they have the highest rate of H I V  transmissions in Honduras Ms  Batiz said she learned she was infected only after Kirad was born  She felt ill and went to a doctor  who told her the news  She was H I V  positive and had been for years  Her boyfriend  who most likely infected her  left   He abandoned us   she said  He s the father of her three youngest daughters  she has two older children from a previous relationship   She had the girls tested  Susan  the middle child  was H I V  positive too Ms  Batiz turned to a nongovernmental organization in Honduras that helps people with H I V  She became an H I V  educator  Soon  Ms  Batiz was working for the organization  attending protests to demand more medicine  One time  she said  police used tear gas and hoses on demonstrators  She was also featured in a 2013 video by the Pulitzer Center about what it s like to be Garifuna and living with H I V Her descriptions are reminiscent of AIDS activists in the U S  during the 1980s who were part of the protest movement Act Up  Ms  Batiz said this activity made her an easy target in Honduras  She was a black woman with H I V   protesting for better conditions  and living in a place where people are terrified of AIDS   Sometimes I was walking down the street and some people would see me and say   Here comes the one with SIDA    she said  using the Spanish word for AIDS   It s very difficult situation to be there as an activist  Officially  Honduras has stronger protections for people with H I V  than some of its neighbors  But the reality  according to Amnesty International and the U S  State Department  is that people with H I V  are routinely denied access to jobs  education and health services  The women who are infected are considered to be dirty   said Deborah Ottenheimer  a Manhattan based gynecologist who does exams for women seeking asylum because of human rights abuses  She has met Honduran women with H I V  who experienced all types of persecution  including forced sterilization  They can t get jobs  they often are attacked  Their children   especially if their children are thought to be  not even known to be  but thought to be H I V  positive   will also be discriminated against  They won t be allowed to go to school  Ms  Batiz s daughters suffered at school  especially Susan   Everybody  all my classmates  knew about my mother and my sister  too   Kirad recalled  She said they called Susan  sidosa   a slur against people with AIDS There were also vicious attacks   They would take her to the bathroom and would put her head in the toilet   Kirad said  adding that these were filthy toilets without modern plumbing Kirad said she saw students push her sister s head into a toilet on about five different occasions  and that she would try to fight the other kids in the bathroom  Susan didn t want to tell their mother  but Kirad did  When Ms  Batiz confronted the school  she said the director behaved as though it was no big deal  At some point around 2016  things got so bad that she took both of her girls out of school and kept them at home The next year  Ms  Batiz said her house was burned down under mysterious circumstances  No one was home at the time  She didn t know who did it  and she didn t contact the police because she was certain they wouldn t investigate  But she said she knew it was arson because she smelled the gasoline   I think they were trying to get me to leave   she said The family moved in with neighboring friends  but Ms  Batiz started making plans to take Kirad and Susan to stay with her sister in New York The Credible Fear InterviewImageThe yard outside of Ms  Batiz s home in Honduras  abandoned after their house was set on fire When asylum officers conduct a credible fear interview  they ask basic questions about how a migrant was persecuted and what role the authorities played  The Trump Administration claims the bar is too low because most easily pass  even though less than a quarter actually wind up getting asylum  Migrants who pass the test can wait years for their asylum cases to go to immigration court  because of an enormous backlog  In the meantime they can qualify for working papers  The president has criticized this as  catch and release  Ms  Batiz said her interview happened the same day she arrived at the  icebox   She recalled the two officers who questioned her gasping when she told them how she faced discrimination for having H I V   I think that s why they took me out quickly   she said The next morning  Ms  Batiz and Kirad were released to go on to New York  They didn t know what happened to Susan  only that she had been taken away hours earlier  Kirad said they asked people at the processing center but were told only that Susan was taken to a different place   My mother started crying   she recalled  With no additional information  they took a bus to San Antonio where they got assistance from a Catholic aid organization  which paid for them to fly to New York Soon after arriving at her sister s home in Far Rockaway  Ms  Batiz got a call from Susan  She was 1 900 miles away at an adult detention center in Pearsall  Tex   run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement  She was examined by a doctor and given H I V  medications  But it took three weeks for her to get her credible fear interview During that waiting period  Susan said a doctor told her that the H I V  drugs she was given in Honduras were not working well  She said she was also under great distress  begging other detainees in her room to let her sleep on the bottom bunk because she was afraid of heights  She had never been away from her mother before and said she was scared of the women who worked at the detention center  claiming they said cruel things to her because she was black and from Honduras The credible fear interview took place on Aug  8  with an asylum officer speaking English in person and a Spanish interpreter on the phone  When we spoke in January  Susan recalled telling the officer about the persecution she suffered at school  She said she described how classmates would abuse her in the bathrooms   They would put my head in the toilet and urinate on me  The transcript of Susan s credible fear interview does not include this graphic incident  Regardless  it shows that Susan clearly stated that she was threatened and discriminated against  and that students wanted to kill her   Because I am H I V  positive   she said   and because I am black   She said students feared she would  contaminate  them ImageMs  Batiz and her younger daughter  right  at an immigration appointment in Manhattan Susan also described an episode in which her classmates beat her legs with a stick so badly that she was taken to a hospital  There  she said  the nurses gave her  dirty looks  because they  discriminate against black girls  Police officers spoke with Susan at the hospital  She said she told them about the attack  and that they helped her by talking to the school  When asked by the asylum officer how the police treated black people and those with H I V   Susan answered   They treat them well  The asylum officer found Susan s overall account credible  But she made a distinction that prevented Susan from moving forward with her asylum case  She checked a box that said  credible fear of persecution NOT established   She left unchecked all of the boxes designating asylum eligibility because of persecution  These are race  religion  political activity  nationality and membership in a particular social group  This last category could include people with H I V A couple of immigration and asylum experts who viewed the transcript said Susan was rightfully rejected because she said the police were helpful  Stan Weber  an immigration lawyer in Brooklyn who previously worked for ICE  said he could see that argument  in part Mr  Weber explained that the persecution Susan described was not from  a government actor or an agent of the government   He added   The parties that were inflicting the persecution or the threat of persecution were private actors  In other words  Susan was being bullied by her classmates  Nonetheless  Mr  Weber is among several experts who believe the asylum officer was unfair to Susan  noting her youth  the possibility of a language barrier and her emotional state Early in the transcript it notes  applicant is crying   Shortly after  there s another red flag  Interpreter notes that the applicant doesn t seem to connect terms in Spanish   the transcript read  adding that the interpreter and applicant  might not be able to understand each other clearly  ImageBack in Honduras  Susan almost never ventures outside except to use an outhouse or to travel to a clinic to get her H I V  medication Susan speaks both Spanish and Garifuna  She was asked if she preferred a Garifuna interpreter but she responded that she was fine continuing in Spanish  Mr  Weber said that should have given the asylum officer pause  You have an 18 year old child separated from her parent that doesn t speak a primary language that you re conversing in  that the interpreter s indicated that there s problems understanding  and she s crying and she has a very stigmatized condition  H I V  positive   he said   The officer  I think  blew it  He said the asylum officer also missed an obvious opportunity to ask about Susan s mother  because Susan stated that they came together and that her mother had gone on to New York Susan now claims the asylum officer pressured her to say the police were helpful  Within the transcript  she also said she was threatened at school by students about 20 times and never reported these incidents to the police  out of fear  because they told me they would hurt me more if I reported it  Later in August  Susan asked an immigration judge to review the asylum officer s decision  But she had no lawyer  and the hearing was conducted by video  The judge denied her appeal  Susan s family then scraped up the money to hire Elizabeth Caballero  a lawyer in Texas  who asked U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services for a new credible fear interview  Despite additional written testimony from Susan s mother and sister about her persecution  she was deported  Susan was put on a plane back to Honduras in November without any advance notice  Ms  Caballero said  giving her no chance to legally intervene  In her 12 years practicing immigration law  she said  only one other client was deported without any warning  She s still angry about it  Here we have somebody that can actually be considered part of a particular social group   Ms  Caballero said   And she got denied  A spokeswoman with the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services said it can t comment on individual cases  But she noted the 2010 law that allowed people with H I V  to enter the country  She also said the agency reviews each case on its own merit  with decisions based on relevant laws and evidence  They didn t want her here   Ms  Caballero concluded  adding she suspects it s because Susan has H I V   They re just as ignorant as the people who discriminate against her over there  in her home country  Adults or Children ImageA bodega in Far Rockaway  Queens  the neighborhood where Ms  Batiz s sister lives  and where she and her daughter are staying while petitioning for asylum In Queens  Ms  Batiz describes feeling at ease without the discrimination she suffered in Honduras  But she constantly worries about Susan  In January  Ms  Batiz met with her lawyer  Cristina Velez  at the Jamaica office of Queens Legal Services  They sat at a small table in a sparsely furnished conference room and made a video call to Susan in Honduras  so Ms  Velez could learn more about what happened to prepare for Ms  Batiz s asylum claim Susan s oval face filled the screen of her mother s cellphone  Now 19  she is staying with the same friends who put her family up after the 2017 fire  The two room house is crowded  with a bedroom where seven people are sleeping  It s crammed with belongings  and the windows are covered by wooden shutters and fabric Susan pointed the phone to show her mother and lawyer the bright blue Caribbean sky and the bed where she sleeps  A paralegal who is fluent in Spanish was translating for Ms  Velez and everyone wanted to know one thing  Is she safe  I do not feel safe   Susan said through the interpreter  her voice growing animated  When Ms  Velez asked why  she described people coming to the house and threatening her  They wear ski masks on their head and they told me that they re going to kill me if they see me alone  and why did I come back here  I should have stayed with my mother where I was  Susan said it has happened about six times since she returned in November  and that they sometimes pointed guns at her   They want to kill me because I have H I V    she said  She locks herself in the house when they come  She said she doesn t know who they are  but speculated that the men could be members of the local gangs  so common in Honduras  who have threatened her family and others in the past for refusing to cooperate with them  Susan said she only goes out with a friend occasionally  or to take a taxi to the hospital once a month for her H I V  medicine ImageSusan says that armed men in masks have come to the house where she is staying and threatened her After listening to this account  Ms  Velez said that Ms  Batiz has a very strong case for asylum and that Susan would have  as well  She can t understand the logic in separating the mother and daughter  I haven t seen a case in which a family member who is really still dependent on the parent and whose cases overlap so entirely be separated from the family unit and not permitted to make her case   she said Kirad is now starting over as a freshman at a public high school in Queens with a bilingual program  She has a backpack filled with notebooks for math  history  biology and English  She thinks Susan would love the high school  and wishes they could go together But the odds are against Susan ever joining her sister  Because she failed to persuade an asylum officer of her credible fear  and her appeal to a judge was then denied  Susan can t try seeking asylum again  Even if she were somehow able to make the trek by herself from Honduras to the border  she would face a different process for being allowed to stay in the country because of her prior removal  The bar for passing this test would be much higher  making that  a risky proposition  according to Ms  Velez  her mother s lawyer Now Susan s only hope of coming to the U S  lies with her mother s case  If Ms  Batiz is granted asylum  she could bring her daughter here as a dependent  Her next court date is in May  but it s just a procedural hearing  The immigration court in New York is so backlogged it could take another year or more for her trial Speaking from Honduras  Susan said she s not giving up hope  She hasn t been able to go to school for about three years  But if she makes it to the U S   she said  she wants to go to a technical school and become a nurse   I want to keep studying and doing something with my life   she said José Olivares of WNYC contributed translation assistance and research  and Lidia Hernandez contributed translation assistance Beth Fertig   bethfertig  is a reporter

Why don t streaming services like Hulu or Netflix go bankrupt  After all  most businesses couldn t survive if customers paid a flat subscription fee each month for all they could eat or all the gasoline they could use  Yet you can pay Netflix  8 99 and watch one movie or all 342 episodes  so far  of  Grey s Anatomy   Netflix doesn t care Netflix and Hulu can do this because they sell products with a very low marginal cost  Movies and TV shows are expensive to make  But once that s done  each new stream costs Netflix little or nothing Another product works in a similar way  medicine Last week the Senate grilled pharmaceutical officials about the absurd costs of medicines  Public outrage had been building  but it exploded in 2013 with the debut of new cures for hepatitis C  They were very good drugs with very high prices   the first two listed for  84 000 and  94 500 per 12 week treatment  Now  popular revolt is brewing over the costs of insulin  naloxone  penicillin  EpiPens and many other drugs The executives commiserated with the American people   and blamed everyone else in the supply chain  Although President Trump has promised tough action  the administration has taken the issue only semi seriously  talking about measures that have brought down prices in other countries   a little But Australia is doing something that could help a lot  treating medicines like Netflix treats shows In 2015  Australia signed agreements with Gilead  AbbVie  Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck  producers of the new hep C cures  For 1 billion Australian dollars    766 million U S    Australia gets  for five years  all the hep C medicine it can use The size and certainty of the payment guarantees that the drug companies will get large profits  And they can look like good guys A study just published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that on average  Australia pays  7 352  U S   per course of treatment  It has been able to treat seven times as many patients as it would without the agreements In the United States  Louisiana and Washington State are following Australia  In bidding that closed on Thursday  Louisiana received responses from AbbVie  Merck and a Gilead subsidiary  Asegua Therapeutics  Louisiana s secretary of health  Dr  Rebekah Gee  said that the state hopes to have contracts with one or more companies and begin getting medicines on July 1 This is a big deal  The model can be used in other places and for other drugs  Most important  it s something drugmakers are willing to do   It s feasible to implement other ways of paying for innovation   said Dr  Suerie Moon  the lead author of the study  who is director of research at the Global Health Center of the Graduate Institute of Geneva   That s what s been missing so far in some of the state level debates  It s been done  at a large scale  It s not a crazy experiment  Hep C kills more people in the United States than all other infectious diseases combined  Cases are soaring  largely caused by injection of heroin and opiates  it s a blood borne virus spread by sharing needles Yet six years after the debut of the first new cure  only 450 000 people have been treated   15 percent of those with hep C in America The reason is cost  For a clue about what hep C drugs actually cost to make  consider Greg Jefferys  an Australian who runs a hep C buyers  club  Sophie Cousins profiled him in Fixes last year   Mr  Jefferys arranges shipping of Harvon  the drug listed at  94 500   which is made in India by generic drugmakers licensed by Gilead  such as Cipla and Mylan  The cost is  850 for a full course of treatment  and that includes shipping anywhere  Mr  Jefferys offers other hep C drugs as well  He recently started selling to low income patients  for  350 per course of treatment  a drug combination that has been effective against all strains of hep C   American authorities have permitted Mr  Jefferys s patients to import these medicines  It s true that nobody actually pays  94 500  The system of rebates and discounts is so complex that it s impossible to track what governments and insurers actually pay  but it s probably closer to  50 000 per treatment Nevertheless  between 2013 and 2015  Medicaid spending on outpatient drugs rose by 41 5 percent   almost entirely attributable to new hep C medicines  Kentucky spent 7 percent of its Medicaid budget in 2014 to treat only 861 hep C patients  The cost has forced most states to reserve the drug for the sickest patients  And most states require patients to be off drugs in order to get treatment That is a dumb public health move  Hep C is a contagious disease  Just as with H I V   limiting treatment only spreads the virus  And the people most likely to pass it on are injecting drug users   who are barred from getting treatment Nor does it make financial sense  Failure to treat hep C not only spread the epidemic  it also leads to chronic liver disease  cirrhosis and liver cancer The real cost effective  and humane  strategy would be to aim to eradicate hep C  A study by the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales  which studies infectious diseases  found that Australia is now on track to do that there by 2026 Louisiana is the sickest state in the nation  according to Dr  Gee  and one of the poorest  In January  the state asked drug makers to bid on a plan to supply unlimited amounts of hep C drugs for a payment of  35 million   the amount it had spent in 2018 to treat only about 1 000 of the estimated 90 000 people infected The money would treat patients on Medicaid and those incarcerated   We had a  2 billion budget deficit and have to balance the budget every year   she said   It s a zero sum game  For us to spend more on health means spending on K through 12 education has to go down  ImageTop executives of pharmaceutical companies testified at a Senate hearing last week about drug pricing CreditWin McNamee Getty ImagesEven with good profits assured  pharmaceutical companies are hesitant about schemes like the Netflix model  they re wary of doing anything that could put a crack in a system that has served them well  and hope to ride out public anger at high prices   Spokesmen for Gilead and AbbVie  the two largest makers of hep C drugs  declined to be interviewed   But Dr  Gee carefully laid the groundwork  She held years of meetings  working with the National Governors Association and the National Academy of Medicine to build support  And in 2017 she explored asking the federal government to help in overriding patents by invoking a law that allows lower cost generic production  paying the patent holder fair compensation  Drugmakers hate this law  The federal government has used it frequently  including for products like tractor wheels and corn seeds  In the 1960s  the government invoked it often to obtain needed medicines  But the pharmaceutical industry has ensured  by using its formidable political powers  that it has not been used for drugs in recent years Still  the simple threat of seeking to override patents was a signal that Louisiana was serious   It got the attention of the industry   Dr  Gee said High prices are a major barrier to treatment  Another is a lack of liver specialists  Dr  Gee said that Louisiana now allows nonspecialists to prescribe hep C drugs  a switch that has been successful in Australia And Australia has long invested in harm reduction measures  like needle exchange  which has averted hundreds of thousands of infections and provided a path with which to work with injecting drug users  Dr  Gregory Dore  a professor and the head of the Viral Hepatitis Clinical Research Program at the Kirby Institute  said that Australia has so effectively reached this group that their treatment rates are higher than those of infected people who don t inject   That s the way public health is supposed to work   he said Hep C drugs could be just the beginning for the Netflix model  Several experts I talked to suggested naloxone  the drug that reverses opioid overdose  as a candidate  Others mentioned insulin and H I V  treatments The Netflix business model makes particular sense for hep C drugs  said Rachel Sachs  an associate professor of law at Washington University School of Law  Hep C is a communicable disease  so governments have a strong public health interest in treating as many patients as possible  With widespread treatment  hep C could be eradicated   That rarely comes along and is important to pursue as a public health matter   she said  referring to the possibility of eradication  Another advantage is that several companies make hep C cures  she said  Companies will not want to let a competitor take the market and so they may bid just to avoid being shut out  She said that without the public health rationale and competition  it might be more difficult for a government to get drug companies to participate in Netflix style schemes  The Netflix model is an example of delinkage  pricing schemes that decouple rewards for pharmaceutical innovation from a drug s price  Another example is to offer a drugmaker a big prize for new drugs that matter to society  Prize funds could provide lower prices  broaden access to medicines and incentivize the creation of important drugs rather than big selling drugs  Senator Bernie Sanders regularly introduces the Medical Innovation Prize Fund Act and another bill proposing a fund for H I V  drugs  The legislation goes nowhere There s one category of drugs where delinkage is no longer controversial  and that s antibiotics  The world desperately needs more antibiotics  as even some second line ones are failing because of overuse  But any new antibiotic must be used extremely sparingly   only when all current antibiotics fail   in order to stave off its own failure  The current pricing model rewards selling as much as possible  which is the opposite of what you want  That s why we haven t seen a new class of antibiotics in 30 years A prize fund could persuade companies to work on antibiotics  Democratic legislators regularly introduce a bill to lower medicine costs that includes a  2 billion prize for new antibiotics  A different  bipartisan bill would reward a company that makes a new class of antibiotics with a year s patent extension on another of its drugs   potentially worth billions Less dramatically  there s an organization named CARB X  for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria  founded in 2016 at Boston University School of Law  CARB X members include the United States  British and German governments  foundations like Gates and the British Wellcome Trust  and a network of scientific and business experts  It offers funding and scientific and business help to small companies  Kevin Outterson  a law professor who directs CARB X  said six companies are already in human trials with new drugs The new ingredient in all this is public outrage  which can help apply a counterweight to the might of the pharmaceutical industry  Political will matters   Australia said we re not going to settle for 10 percent coverage   said Dr  Moon  the lead author of the study of Australia s program   We re going to find a way to 100 percent  If other governments were to follow that course of action  they d get results  too  Tina Rosenberg won a Pulitzer

WASHINGTON   On a three state tour this week to promote her child focused initiative   Be Best   Melania Trump showed that her time as first lady has sharpened an already sophisticated understanding of how to enhance her public image In a glossy and tightly controlled environment  Mrs  Trump restricted the majority of her interactions to emphasize motherhood   perhaps the only part of her private life that she has publicly embraced  In Tulsa  Okla   she had a heartwarming exchange with a child who dislikes homework  In Seattle  she spoke to assembled Microsoft executives about the challenges children face online  And onstage at a theater in Las Vegas  she shared a rare personal story about warning her 12 year old son  Barron  about the dangers of drug abuse  I try to explain how drugs are dangerous   Mrs  Trump said   and how they will mess up your head  mess up your body  and nothing positive comes of it  Mrs  Trump s tour firmed up her commitment to  Be Best   which addresses social media  well being and the opioid crisis  and which has faced setbacks from the start  The momentum of a Rose Garden debut in May was slowed when Mrs  Trump fell ill from a kidney condition soon afterward  And since then  she and her 12 person East Wing staff have had to deal with a departing policy director  a lengthy government shutdown  and countless chaotic news cycles engulfing President Trump s White House When Mrs  Trump embarked on this week s trip  she made it clear that she would not be talking about anything she deemed off topic when she ignored a reporter s shouted question about the testimony of Michael D  Cohen  her husband s former personal lawyer  Last week  Mr  Cohen told Congress that he deeply regretted lying to Mrs  Trump about an alleged affair between her husband and the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels ImageMrs  Trump watching science experiments at a school in Tulsa  Okla CreditPatrick Semansky Associated PressMrs  Trump instead tried to keep her message trained on  Be Best   But by Tuesday  the second and final day of her trip  she took a moment at the town hall style event in Las Vegas to chide the news media for dedicating time to other coverage besides the opioid crisis  I challenge the press to devote as much time to the lives lost and the potential lives that could be saved  by dedicating the same amount of coverage that you do to idle gossip or trivial stories   Mrs  Trump said The first lady did not specify which stories she considered unwelcome  but  like her husband  she pays close attention to her news coverage  poring over the headlines on social media  That private behavior tends to conflict with her public admonishments  Mrs  Trump has castigated the news media for focusing on her image  including matters of her personal style  despite relying on it as a powerful messaging tool   with mixed results   in the past Modern first ladies  said Anita McBride  who served as Laura Bush s chief of staff  have faced intense pressure to field questions about their private lives while trying to build substantive policy platforms without the luxury of a West Wing size staff  Mrs  Bush s National Book Festival survived  in part  because it was co opted by the Library of Congress  And several partners helped push along Michelle Obama s  Let s Move  initiative  including her efforts to find funding for salad bars in schools Even so  both women faced questions regarding anything but those platforms  It s not just her   Mrs  McBride said of Mrs  Trump   It s this constant focus on the clothes and the private life   But any first lady  she added  must endure scrutiny about what she called  that mystery behind the walls of the White House  In recent months  Mrs  Trump has continued to try to reinforce the idea that her behind the scenes efforts are more important than surface curiosities  In December  she hired Art Harding  who previously worked on policy issues at the United States Agency for International Development  to fill the role of policy director  Stephanie Grisham  Mrs  Trump s communications director  said in an email VideoOn a tour of three states this week  the first lady  Melania Trump  hasn t been able to avoid questions about the controversies surrounding her husband  At a town hall  she criticized the media for not dedicating enough time to covering the American opioid crisis CreditCreditEthan Miller Getty ImagesMs  Grisham said the East Wing was also working on partnerships that are meant to help Mrs  Trump s  Be Best  message endure  Those partners include Lily s Place  a West Virginia clinic that treats babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome  the National Institutes of Health and Microsoft The opioid crisis is one issue that administration officials and those close to the crisis say Mrs  Trump has succeeded in spotlighting Kellyanne Conway  the counselor to the president  said that Mrs  Trump decided to fold the subject of opioids into her portfolio in the summer of 2017  and has regularly been at the president s side since he declared the matter a public health emergency that fall  This is the one public policy issue that they work on together   Ms  Conway said   The first lady lending her voice and visibility is priceless currency  Others say Mrs  Trump s willingness to lend her image has led to a noticeable increase in awareness around neonatal abstinence syndrome  a condition in which babies are born in opioid withdrawal   one suffering from the condition is born every 15 minutes  according to government statistics As deaths from drug overdoses skyrocket  the Trump administration s handling of opioid addiction has not escaped the reaches of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  which announced on Wednesday that it would hold a hearing to determine if the White House had been deficient in its approach to national drug policy  Even so  Jessica Hulsey Nickel  the founder of Addiction Policy Forum  a group of organizations working to elevate awareness of the opioid crisis  said Mrs  Trump s work was a  gift  for people struggling to find resources ImageMrs  Trump in Las Vegas  On her tour this week  she restricted the majority of her interactions to emphasize motherhood CreditBrendan Smialowski Agence France Presse   Getty Images To pay attention and to shine a spotlight on the moms and babies affected by this disease who are often overlooked   Ms  Hulsey Nickel said   that s important and it deserves recognition  As she closed out her  Be Best  tour in Las Vegas  Mrs  Trump shared her thoughts on the opioid crisis with Eric Bolling  a friend of the Trumps whose son died after an accidental opioid overdose in 2017  Mr  Bolling said that interest in the town hall style events he hosts as part of an initiative by Sinclair Broadcast Group  the country s largest broadcaster   blows up  when he is able to announce Mrs  Trump s participation  You can probably fake a lot of things  a lot of initiatives   Mr  Bolling said   But you cannot fake empathy  In the end  even Mr  Bolling could not resist asking Mrs  Trump a round of personal questions  She told him that her days involve renovation projects   including the White House bowling alley   overseeing the White House residence staff  working with the White House Historical Association and managing her son s schedule Mr  Bolling s comparatively casual line of questioning prompted dozens of off topic headlines  including those that focused on the preferred Trump family dish   spaghetti  Mrs  Trump guessed   over the importance of the opioid crisis After Mrs  Trump returned home  the East Wing chided the news media for veering off topic 
Doug Mills  a staff photographer for The Times  has been covering the White House since 1983  He spoke with James Estrin this week about photographing President Trump after he returned from covering the Hanoi summit with Kim Jong un  The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity Q  How much time do you usually have when you photograph the president A  With previous administrations  going back to Reagan  you were in a cabinet room for maybe two or three or four minutes  With Trump you can be in there up to 90 minutes  What does that mean photographically Sometimes you feel like you re a fly on the wall because you can pretty much move around the room  change angles and change lenses  You can study him and look for other people in the room ImageMr  Trump with the North Korean leader  Kim Jong un  in Singapore  June 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesImageMr  Trump joined the national anthem at the national college football championship game in Atlanta  January 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesHow was this most recent trip to the Hanoi summit On a foreign trip  there are a lot more variables  but nobody thought the president would answer questions when he was sitting next to Kim Jong un  and certainly nobody expected that Kim Jong un would actually respond to a U S  reporter s question  So we were in there a little more than we expected It was negotiated that we could preset and wait for them to come into the room  That brought the temperature down so there wasn t a complete scrum  I don t think President Trump likes seeing the scrums either but they happen  no matter what  with everybody But this one had more decorum and more formality   plus the North Korean photographers and the Americans were in different positions The North Korean photographers like to be elevated because President Trump is taller than Kim Jong un   so most of the U S  still photographers  there were four of us  knelt down and the North Koreans stood above us  or up on ladders  so Trump wouldn t look like he was so much taller Are you concerned how the president might react to your pictures President Trump obviously is a very visual person and he looks at The New York Times daily and online  and on Twitter  So he knows the pictures that I m producing  People ask  does that make me think twice about taking pictures that are not flattering  and my answer is no He s told me about pictures that he hasn t liked of mine on a couple of different occasions  He s very camera conscious  But he still makes compliments about me or my work I appreciate his recognizing good and fair photography and I think that s what I do  I have no agenda  and I photograph what s in front of me  and it doesn t matter whether I think he looks flattering or not flattering  or he looks upset or he looks happy   that s irrelevant to me My job while I m in with the president at any event is to try to capture the most storytelling photograph  If it s a meeting that is jovial or happy  then it s going to show in the pictures  But if he s upset or frustrated or angry then those pictures will reflect that ImageMr  Trump with his wife  Melania  at an

TimesImageMr  Trump at a news conference in the White House after the midterm elections  November 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesIs photographing this president different in any ways from the previous four you ve photographed Obama was the most photogenic president I ve covered  and Trump is the most iconic  No matter where you see Trump  what light you see him in  what situation we photograph him in  you know right away it s him  Whether it s the hair  his tall stature  his black jackets  the 45 embroidered on his shirts  You just know it s him We have more access to him than we ever had to any other president that I ve covered  Much more  We re in photo ops much longer  He knows the power of driving the news cycle  And he does that day in and day out  and in order for him to do that we have to have access to him  He can drive it with Twitter  but if there s a huge story going out that may not be positive to him  all of a sudden we re in and there s something else going on When I photographed him in New York before he was president I found that he was very conscious about camera angles  He knows exactly what our job is There was a controversy with Obama when there were fewer and fewer events that the press were allowed into and more situations where his photographer was taking pictures  That s not what s happening with Trump  is it  The Obama folks had a knack for controlling President Obama s image  and circumvented the media by going around us through Twitter  Facebook and Instagram  There were a lot of situations that we normally would photograph but they chose to use their government photographer to photograph the event and then put it out on social media There was a lot of criticism from photographers who covered Obama as well as the White House Correspondents Association and the White House News Photographers AssociationTrump calls the media fake news  and particularly criticizes The New York Times and The Washington Post  yet photographically you are having more access than with previous presidents you ve covered It does bother me when I hear him say that  because I know there s nothing about my photographs that are fake  We are just there doing our jobs  Clearly I don t think The New York Times is putting out any fake news ImageMrs  Trump during a trip to Cairo  October 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesImageMr

Pittsburgh  January 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesWhen you have access to him it s also less controlled in some ways He is not very controlled  His aides can try to control an event  but President Trump will undoubtedly do something unexpected  He s not a politician and he is not somebody who has been groomed by handlers  So he is more likely to go off script  more likely to be himself  more likely to do things that are not done by traditional politicians  like letting us in for a cabinet room for 90 minutes You re on the White House Correspondents Association board  What do you do I am the representative for the still photographers  And that includes all of the camera and sound people  I am constantly in contact with people who are making decisions about the media at the White House so all of us can do our jobs better and have as much access as we can as a group You ve covered George W  Bush  President Obama  and President Trump for The Times  Before that you also  for The Associated Press  covered Clinton  George H W  Bush  and Reagan  How has it been different covering each of them Every administration is different  You try to build a relationship of trust with every administration   that they know you re doing your job fairly and have no agenda  Every administration  every president  treats photographers differently Reagan was an actor  so when he went on stage he had this charisma and he would light up  His personality just grew as he spoke and as he gestured Bush 41 had one of the closest relationships with photographers because he was vice president for eight years before becoming president  He knew a lot of us by first names and had a nickname for us   photo dogs   He would invite us to play horseshoes with him and to go jogging with him  He wasn t trying to play us  that was just his personality  He respected what we did When Clinton came in it was a totally different feel  We had plenty of access  He was very energetic and never stopped working  He loved rope lines  knew they made for great pictures and he seemed to get energy from going into a crowd and staying there for 30 40 minutes shaking hands after an event His relationship with photographers was not as close as it was with Bush 41 and after the Lewinsky scandal there was less access Because of his dad  Bush 43 really liked photographers  He d also call us photo dogs  He was very athletic and would invite photographers to bike ride with him  He liked to hang out and talk to reporters and photographers at times  just to feel them out  mostly off the record while on the plane or at social events  He was a lot of fun to photograph  He didn t have the stage presence of other presidents  but he was a character and would do things that made for good pictures Obviously 9 11 was important in his presidency  That really drove the image of him being a strong president  although he was the first president I ever saw cry in the Oval Office ImageHouse

of the people  Yes  that s disturbing to me Yet he speaks well of you during the summit with Kim last week  where he said you are  one of the best photographers in the world  I think he obviously

BEIJING   A senior Chinese trade official called on Saturday for a compromise between the United States and China that could make a trade deal easier to reach this spring  But it could also lead to a more fragile agreement  which could fall apart quickly should trade frictions rise again Over the past year  the most contentious issue in the countries  trade talks has been the Trump administration s demand for what it calls an enforcement provision  which would allow the United States to monitor China s behavior and put penalties in place if the Chinese violated the deal The Trump administration has pressed China to accept an agreement allowing the United States to unilaterally reimpose tariffs if it concludes that China has not gone through with structural changes to its economy  In the past month  the administration has also pushed for a broader enforcement mechanism  which would include the right to reimpose tariffs for any category of goods in which imports from China surge In exchange  the Trump administration would roll back at least some of the tariffs it placed on  250 billion of imports from China that it imposed last year  penalties that have strained ties between the governments  rocked financial markets and thrown the future of companies that operate in both countries in doubt Chinese officials have strongly resisted the idea of an enforcement provision  They worry that the Trump administration  or future ones  could invoke it at any time to restart trade frictions ImageChina s vice minister of commerce  Wang Shouwen  right  said on Saturday that Beijing could accept a deal giving each side an equal right to take trade actions against the other CreditFred Dufour Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBut Wang Shouwen  China s vice minister of commerce for international trade negotiations  raised a possible compromise at a news conference in Beijing on Saturday morning  He said China would be amenable to an agreement that gave each side an equal right to take trade actions against the other side after an agreement was struck  Any implementation mechanism must go in both directions  fair and equal   Mr  Wang said  using China s preferred term for an enforcement mechanism  He spoke at an annual news conference given by the Chinese Commerce Ministry s top officials  in conjunction with the 11 day session of the country s rubber stamp legislature  the National People s Congress Mr  Wang did not address another aspect of the enforcement question that has deeply divided the United States and China  While the Trump administration wants the right to reimpose tariffs unilaterally  China s Commerce Ministry has favored creating a lengthy process of bilateral consultations if either side has a grievance In testimony before Congress on Feb  27  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  outlined a possible method for enforcing the deal under which the two sides would hold a regular series of meetings at multiple levels of government  and  if China violated the agreement  American tariffs would spring back into force The details of that proposal aren t fully clear  But some American businesses are wary of a deal that would only allow them to air complaints through the government  as Mr  Lighthizer s description seemed to suggest  They said such an arrangement could be time consuming and ultimately lack the capacity to address many of the problems faced by the thousands of American companies operating in China Other trade deals that the United States has signed in the past have included different methods that companies could use to resolve problems  like a special court for investors  But the Trump administration has been suspicious of those kinds of arrangements  viewing them as a potential infringement on American sovereignty ImagePresident Trump and President Xi Jinping of China in Beijing in 2017  Mr  Wang  the Chinese official  would not say whether the two might meet in Florida this month to seal a deal CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesAmerican businesses also contend that having the main penalty for violating the agreement be the reimposition of tariffs risks creating lasting uncertainty  The companies are now weighing whether to continue to invest in China or whether the prospect of additional levies would make it less risky to move operations abroad As long as the threat of tariffs looms  the United States and China could resolve their differences in the coming months  only to find themselves back in a similar stalemate next year  We could definitely see ourselves in yet another period of uncertainty   said Erin Ennis  senior vice president of the U S  China Business Council Mr  Wang did not answer a question about whether Mr  Trump and President Xi Jinping might meet in Florida this month to seal a trade deal  Tentative plans for such a summit meeting have been put in doubt by continued disagreement over an enforcement mechanism  and over what limits China might accept on its ability to subsidize high tech manufacturing If the two sides agree on an enforcement provision that covers import surges  it might be more useful to the United States Research by Brad Setser  who was a Treasury economist in the Obama administration and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York  has found broad stagnation in American exports of manufactured goods over the past few years  a possible sign of eroding American competitiveness  By contrast  Chinese exports to countries all over the world have been surging China wants the United States to remove all of the extra tariffs that Mr  Trump imposed last year  That would leave China with its average tariffs of 7 5 percent on imports from all over the world  compared to 5 percent for the European Union and 3 percent for the United States China contends that it is still a developing country and therefore should not have to operate under the same trade rules as the West  Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at the news conference on Saturday that any reform of the World Trade Organization  which the Trump administration has sought to overhaul  should respect the different needs of developing countries Mr  Trump has promised an ambitious agreement that would address ever rising American trade deficits with China at a time when Beijing poses a growing geopolitical challenge to the United States  China has built the world s largest navy and an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea  and it has tried to promote its combination of single party authoritarianism and state led economic growth as a global alternative to democracy and free markets But the overall United States trade deficit  and specifically its deficit with China  further increased last year  Congressional Democrats have become increasingly critical of Mr  Trump on trade in recent days  accusing him of having become too willing to accept a weak deal just to have an agreementMr  Trump and his advisers continued to present a tough front on Friday  even as the president predicted a jump in the stock market if a trade deal were to be reached   If this isn t a great deal  we won t make a deal   he added Mr  Wang said there had been progress during trade talks last month in Washington   and at least one moment of harmony  Vice Premier Liu He of China ordered a hamburger  while Mr  Lighthizer had a Chinese dish  chicken with eggplant sauce  Mr  Wang said the two men turned down offers of tea and coffee  They were both drinking water  they wanted to find common ground   he said 
One of President Trump s lead Middle East peace negotiators lashed out at the Palestinian Authority on Friday  accusing it of institutionalizing support for terrorism amid a dispute over Israeli tax transfers that make up a significant portion of Palestinian revenues Under longstanding accords  Israel makes monthly transfers to the Palestinian Authority from certain taxes it collects related to Palestinians  Last month  Israel announced a freeze on about 5 percent of the tax payout  as punishment for the Palestinian Authority s policy of paying stipends to Palestinian prisoners in Israel and to the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in confrontations with Israelis In response  and despite the authority s financial problems  the Palestinian president  Mahmoud Abbas  rejected the full tax transfer and vowed to continue to pay the stipends On Friday  the Trump administration s Middle East envoy  Jason D  Greenblatt  accused Palestinian leaders of offering the stipends as a reward for acts of terrorism  If your citizens were being routinely attacked by terrorists  which of you would tolerate a reward system that compensated the attackers for their crimes   he wrote in one tweet   How can we possibly censure Israel for taking the same stance  Mr  Greenblatt was in New York on Friday for discussions on the dispute in a closed door session of the United Nations Security Council  which apparently failed to break the impasse Mansour al Otaibi  Kuwait s ambassador to the United Nations  told reporters after the session that most members of the Security Council  overwhelmingly  considered the Israeli decision  unacceptable   This is Palestinian money   he said   They have the right  the Palestinians  to do whatever they want with their money  The tax revenues are generated from the earnings of Palestinian day laborers and merchants who do business in Israel  and from customs duties on Palestinian imports through Israeli ports  But the payouts  which some critics have dubbed a  pay to slay  policy  have long been a source of controversy in Israel In July  the Israeli Knesset  or Parliament  approved legislation that would allow the government to withhold a portion of the tax revenue  which makes up about 7 percent of the Palestinian Authority s annual budget The Palestinian Authority s refusal to accept any of the revenues only adds to its financial woes  It was already struggling after a decision last year by the Trump administration to cut funding for a United Nations agency that provides assistance to millions of Palestinians The Trump administration s hard line tactics have been led by the president s son in law and adviser Jared Kushner  in an effort to force Palestinians to return to the negotiating table and drop many of their longstanding demands  Such discussions have largely been paused while Mr  Kushner and Mr  Greenblatt put the finishing touches on a long awaited peace plan Their eventual proposal  however  could be dead on arrival  The Palestinian Authority has refused to discuss the plan with American negotiators  in protest over the Trump administration s decision in December 2017 to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and move the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv 
WASHINGTON   The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Chad A  Readler of Ohio as President Trump s 33rd federal appeals court judge despite bipartisan criticism that as a Justice Department official in the Trump administration he had shirked his official responsibility to defend the Affordable Care Act when it was challenged in court Mr  Readler s nomination is just the latest to divide the Senate as Republicans renew their drive to fill federal district and circuit court vacancies while gearing up to force through a Senate rules change to accelerate the confirmation process for the remainder of Mr  Trump s tenure With the approval of Mr  Readler to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and two other appeals court nominees headed for a vote  Mr  Trump will have filled nearly 20 percent of the nation s appellate court judgeships  That is a pace well ahead of his predecessors and one that puts his stamp firmly on the federal judiciary  with nearly two years remaining in his term  President Barack Obama did not see his 33rd circuit judge confirmed until early in his second term The fight over Mr  Readler was intensified by his role in the legal struggle over the Affordable Care Act  which Democrats said he was obligated to defend as a top lawyer in the Justice Department s civil division because it was existing law  Instead  he filed a brief in support of a lawsuit by Republican attorneys general aimed at gutting the Affordable Care Act  and argued that it  and its protections against denying coverage for pre existing conditions  was unconstitutional The Trump administration has sought to repeal the law  but the effort failed and the law remains in place Mr  Readler s nomination was approved on a 52 to 47 vote with all Democrats and one Republican voting no  Senator Susan Collins of Maine  the sole Republican to speak out against Mr  Readler  cited his health care argument in opposing him  Rather than defend the law and its protections for individuals with pre existing conditions   such as asthma  arthritis  cancer  diabetes and heart disease   Mr  Readler s brief in Texas v  United States argued that they should be invalidated   she said Democrats seized on that issue  saying that while Senate Republicans proclaimed that they supported coverage for those with existing conditions  they were backing an architect of the Trump administration s attempt to dismantle the law  Tens of millions of Americans who need this protection are watching   said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader   A vote for Readler is very simply a vote for the lawsuit to strike down our health care law   Mr  Schumer noted that Mr  Readler was nominated for the court seat the day after his health care brief was filed  Apparently in the Trump administration depriving people of protections for pre existing conditions   it is something to be rewarded and rewarded no less with a lifetime appointment   he said One after the other  Democrats took to the floor to criticize the nomination  The depth of their opposition   and eagerness to highlight Mr  Readler s health care actions   was demonstrated by unusually strong opposition from Senator Joe Manchin III  Democrat of West Virginia  who has been nearly alone in his willingness to regularly support Trump nominees  including the Supreme Court justices Brett M  Kavanaugh and Neil M  Gorsuch Image A vote for Readler is very simply a vote for the lawsuit to strike down our health care law   said Senator Chuck Schumer of the nominee CreditSarah Silbiger The New York Times This is something I don t do often   Mr  Manchin said   I don t take it lightly   But Mr  Readler  he said  had  single handedly tried to rip insurance away from West Virginians and Americans  when his Justice Department responsibility was just the opposite  This gentleman has basically shown it is not about the law  it is not about the Constitution  it is about his politics and himself and not a man who should be sitting on a higher court   Mr  Manchin said Republicans said little in support of Mr  Readler  nor did any of them back his position in the health care case Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  who has made confirming judicial nominees a top priority  said that Mr  Readler  46  had  built a longstanding reputation in private practice as a consummate legal professional  He was the second appellate judge to be confirmed this week after a Senate vote on Tuesday on the nomination of Allison Rushing  36  a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas  to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  Republicans dismissed concerns about her lack of experience  and Ms  Rushing will be the youngest federal judge in the nation After Mr  Readler s confirmation vote  Mr  McConnell immediately moved to force a final vote on another nominee  Eric E  Murphy  40  the state solicitor for Ohio  to fill another vacancy on the Sixth Circuit  Democrats and liberal activists oppose him  saying he fought against the legalization of same sex marriage and supported efforts to make it harder to vote The fate of another high profile nominee   Neomi Rao for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit   remains uncertain  though Republican objections that threatened her confirmation have quieted Republicans have the power to confirm Mr  Trump s judicial nominees with a simple majority because of a successful attempt by a Democratic led Senate in 2013 to overturn a longstanding rule requiring 60 votes to confirm a judge  But the process can still be time consuming  Mr  McConnell has grown increasingly impatient and frustrated with Democrats for stretching out the time to consider nominees Republicans are now threatening to use their majority to push through a change that would cut debate time on most nominees to two hours from 30 hours after an initial procedural vote  The change would not apply to appeals court judges like Mr  Readler  but it would allow the Senate to clear a backlog of lower level district court nominees much faster Mr  McConnell said again Tuesday that he would like to reach an agreement on the change with Democrats but that appears highly unlikely  We re still hoping to have bipartisan support to go forward with the standing order  which would require 60 votes   Mr  McConnell said   In the absence of that  it is still my desire to try to achieve that  and that s an issue we ll have  a discussion we ll have among Republicans  Without a compromise  Republican senators said they expected to force the rules showdown by the end of the month 
Any week now  any day now   so the news reports go   the special counsel s office will file the Mueller report It will round out a trilogy  In 1974  to inform its impeachment proceedings  Congress received what became known as the  road map   a terse document from the office of the Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski detailing evidence of wrongdoing by President Richard Nixon  In 1998  another investigator submitted a report on a president s potentially impeachable offenses to Congress  a narrative from the independent counsel Kenneth Starr of Bill Clinton s misconduct Following Justice Department regulations  the special counsel Robert Mueller will submit a  confidential report  to the attorney general  Bill Barr  Mr  Barr will decide how much of it to share with Congress and with the world at large Assuming that some significant portion of the report becomes public  and that it provides an additional factual record beyond what we already know  the question will quickly become how to identify any smoking guns  I ve spent the last year and a half following the investigation  Here s a partial list of what I ll be looking for The  Moscow Project  In November 2015  according to Mr  Mueller  Michael Cohen  then Mr  Trump s lawyer  was put in touch with a Russian man who promised Mr  Cohen  political synergy  and  repeatedly proposed a meeting  between Mr  Trump and the Russian president  Vladimir Putin  to help with efforts to construct a Trump Tower Moscow  In January 2016  the office of a  high level Russian official    most likely  according to reports  of Mr  Putin s spokesman Dmitri Peskov   reached out to Mr  Cohen about the project  and efforts on it continued at least into the summer of 2016 How closely were Mr  Trump and his children involved in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations  and over what period  How much did they know of or encourage Mr  Cohen s contacts with the Russian government   including tentative plans for a meeting between Mr  Trump and Mr  Putin  How did the Trump family and campaign understand the connection between the  Moscow project  and Mr  Trump s political ambitions Mr  Mueller estimated in a court filing that Trump Tower Moscow could have generated  hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues    an unusually large profit for the Trump Organization  Why was the number so atypically high   Dirt  on ClintonIn spring 2016  according to the special counsel  a professor linked to the Russian government told the Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that Russia had  dirt  on Hillary Clinton in the form of  thousands of emails   Around this time  the special counsel s indictment of Russian military intelligence officials shows that the Russian government had hacked into networks and accounts belonging to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign  and would soon begin coordinating with WikiLeaks to disseminate the stolen information  In June  Donald Trump Jr  met with a Kremlin linked lawyer at Trump Tower in New York in what seems to have been a failed effort to get similar  dirt  Who else in the campaign did Mr  Papadopoulos tell about his scoop  and how high did that knowledge go  Did Donald Trump Jr  inform his father of his plans before the meeting  Roger Stone and WikiLeaksMr  Mueller s indictment of the Trump adviser Roger Stone alleges that Mr  Stone worked throughout the summer of 2016 to get in touch with WikiLeaks and became aware of the organization s plans to disclose hacked information  Mr  Cohen claimed in his testimony to Congress that he was in the room when Mr  Stone informed Mr  Trump that WikiLeaks was planning a  massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton s campaign  Was Mr  Stone coordinating with the campaign in his efforts to get information from WikiLeaks  How much did Mr  Trump know about what Mr  Stone had found out  And who in the campaign  if anyone  might have been aware of separate efforts by the Republican operative Peter Smith to obtain additional Clinton emails from sources Mr  Smith believed were Russian hackers Flynn s Promises to Moscow The national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired just 24 days into his tenure over fallout from his transition period contacts with the Russian ambassador at the time  Sergey Kislyak   a matter about which he later pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators  When he promised Mr  Kislyak that Mr  Trump would lift sanctions on Russia imposed by the departing Obama administration  was Mr  Flynn freelancing or was he acting on the instructions of someone higher Russian Influence Operations Almost every case that Mr  Mueller has filed has illuminated a different facet of what appears to be a systematic  long running effort by the government of Russia to reach out to Mr  Trump s world  It s clear that the Kremlin was attempting to gain access and influence  Was it also out and out working to recruit agents within the Trump Organization and campaign On our side of the Atlantic  to what extent was that outreach welcomed and reciprocated by the Trump team  and to what extent was Mr  Trump a passive beneficiary  Did the Trump Organization and campaign understand and respond to those instances as manifestations of a systematic effort by the Russian government or as unrelated connections with unconnected Russians Obstruction of JusticeMr  Mueller has also reportedly conducted an investigation into potential obstruction of justice by the president  possible interference with the special counsel s efforts  and with the F B I  s before that  Mr  Barr  among others  has argued that action authorized by the Constitution   like dismissing the F B I  director   by definition cannot constitute obstruction  Will the report sidestep these tricky legal questions by showing efforts by Mr  Trump to derail the inquiry that fall plainly outside the scope of presidential authority  To what extent does the obstruction investigation overlap with the collusion investigation   meaning that the special counsel and the F B I  understood the president s apparent efforts at obstruction as part of the troubling pattern of coordination with the Russian government that incited the investigation in the first place What proportion of the Mueller report becomes public will hinge on many factors  how much classified information and grand jury material shielded from public disclosure it has  how much of it is arguably protected by executive privilege  to what extent it details criminal conduct  and to what extent Mr  Barr may reasonably argue that the Justice Department has an interest in protecting the privacy of those who are innocent The Watergate  road map  first became available to the public in 2018  when a judge ordered it unsealed almost 45 years after it was handed over to Congress  The Starr Report  in contrast  was released within two days of its transmission

Republicans hate deficits  Or at least that s what they claim Republicans in Congress spent the entire Obama administration inveighing against budget deficits  warning incessantly that we were going to have a Greek style fiscal crisis any day now  Donald Trump  on the other hand  focused his ire mainly on trade deficits  insisting that  our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us  But over two years of unified G O P  control of government  a funny thing happened  Both deficits surged  The budget deficit has hit a level unprecedented except during wars and in the immediate aftermath of major economic crises  the trade deficit in goods has set a record What s the significance of this tide of red ink Let s be clear  Neither the budget deficit nor the trade deficit poses a clear and present danger to the U S  economy  Advanced countries that borrow in their own currencies can and often do run up large debts without drastic consequences   which is why the debt panic of a few years ago was always nonsense Yet Trump s twin deficits tell us a lot about both the tweeter in chief and his party   namely  that they re both dishonest and ignorant  Paul Krugman did explanatory journalism before it was cool  moving from a career as a world class economist to writing hard hitting opinion columns  For an even deeper look at what s on his mind  sign up for his weekly newsletter  About the dishonesty  Is there anyone left who believes that Republicans ever really cared about debt and deficits  The truth is that the phoniness of their fiscal posturing should have been obvious all along In any case  at this point it s undeniable that their fire and brimstone debt rhetoric was nothing but a pose  an attempt to weaponize the deficit as a way to block and undermine President Barack Obama s agenda  The moment they had a chance  the very politicians who grandstanded about the need for fiscal responsibility rammed through a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy   a tax cut that is the main reason for the exploding budget deficit Oh  and the tax cut has utterly failed to deliver the promised investment boom  Companies didn t use their giant windfall to build new plants and raise productivity  they used it to buy back a lot of stock  passing the gains on to wealthy investors What about the ignorance  As many people have pointed out to no avail  Trump is all wrong about what trade deficits do  True  at times of high unemployment deficits can cost us jobs  But in normal times they don t reduce overall employment  nor do they make us poorer  On the contrary  other countries are sending us valuable goods and services  which we re paying for with pieces of paper   paper that pays very low interest rates  Who s winning  again Beyond that  however  Trump is completely wrong about what causes trade deficits in the first place  In fact  his own policies have provided an object lesson in the falsity of his vision In the Trumpian universe  trade deficits happen because we made bad deals   we let foreigners sell their stuff here  but they won t let us sell our stuff there  So the solution is to throw up barriers to foreign products   I am a Tariff Man   he proudly proclaimed The reality  however  is that trade deficits have almost nothing to do with tariffs or other restrictions on trade  The overall trade deficit is always equal to the difference between domestic investment spending and domestic saving  both private and public   That s just accounting  The reason America runs persistent trade deficits isn t that we ve given away too much in trade deals  it s that we have low savings compared with other countries Tariffs can  of course  reduce imports of the goods subject to the tariff  and hence reduce the trade deficit in that particular industry  But it s like pushing on a balloon  You can squeeze it in one place  but it will just inflate by the same amount somewhere else  The process through which this conservation of deficits takes place can vary  although a stronger dollar  which hurts exports  is usually one major channel  But the basic result  that tariffs don t actually reduce the overall trade deficit  is clear Sure enough  the Trump tariffs of 2018 did  in fact  lead to a sharp fall in imports of the goods subjected to tariffs  But imports of other goods rose  while exports performed poorly  And the overall trade deficit went up substantially  which is exactly what you should have expected  After all  that big tax cut for the wealthy reduced national savings And the supposed cause of the deficit isn t the only thing Trump gets wrong about trade policy  He also keeps insisting that foreigners are paying his tariffs  In reality  prices received by foreign exporters haven t gone down  Prices paid by U S  consumers have gone up  instead Again  the swelling trade deficit doesn t pose any immediate threat to the U S  economy  And even the Trumpian trade war has probably done only limited economic harm  the main damage is to U S  credibility But Trump s twin deficits show that his party has been lying about its policy priorities  and that he is completely clueless about his signature policy issue  Luckily  a great nation like America can survive a lot  including dishonesty and ignorance at the top The Times is committed to publishing a

WASHINGTON   Mahmoud Abbas  the Palestinian leader  greeted President Trump in February 2017 with a portrait of the American president on mother of pearl panels  framed in white floral foliate An official from Saudi Arabia presented Mr  Trump with a framed assemblage of 12 goldtone items in miniature relating to the kingdom  surrounding a sepia toned photograph of the president  appraised by the State Department at  790 The prime minister of Vietnam gave the president a  gemstone painting  of Mr  Trump smiling against a backdrop of an American flag  made of stone granules  worth about  1 880 Flattery was a major theme of the gifts that Mr  Trump received from foreign officials in the first year of his presidency  based on the list published Thursday in the Federal Register  But that does not make the current president unique Emerald studded  gold plated gift giving has long been part of international diplomacy  with gifts from foreign officials often tailored to the publicly known interests of the man sitting in the Oval Office  Vaclav Havel  the former president of the Czech Republic  gave President Bill Clinton a goldtone saxophone with mother of pearl keys engraved with his signature  in honor of the instrument Mr  Clinton used to play  Heartbreak Hotel  on a TV talk show when he was a candidate for president President Barack Obama  who during his 2008 campaign drew parallels between himself and President Abraham Lincoln  another son of Illinois  was given multiple busts of Mr  Lincoln by foreign leaders  according to Federal Register records  Trying to find appropriate gifts to give to the president is always kind of a test of ingenuity of the donor   said Gerald M  Feierstein  who served as ambassador to Yemen under Mr  Obama   The intent of the gifts is to flatter  and to put the relationship on the best footing  In the Trump administration  a common theme appears to be lavish portraits and paraphernalia depicting the commander in chief  a man known to be concerned with his own self image President Andrzej Duda of Poland  for instance  gave Mr  Trump a burgundy album containing 10 photographs titled   President Donald J  Trump in New York   a collection that included black and white photographs of Mr  Trump in his real estate developer days  as well as polychrome photographs of Trump Tower in Manhattan Foreign officials also appear to have studied the family members who serve as Mr  Trump s inner circle of White House advisers  the gift list shows Jared Kushner  the president s son in law and senior adviser  for instance  was given a book   The Jews of Singapore  by Joan Bieder  from Singapore s minister of foreign affairs  Mr  Kushner is a practicing Orthodox Jew A gift to Melania Trump  the first lady  from President Xi Jinping of China and his wife  Peng Liyuan  features an 85 piece porcelain dinnerware set  The set includes plates displaying hand applied printed images of the pink house at Mar a Lago  the president s Palm Beach  Fla   club where Mr  Trump hosted Mr  Xi for a summit meeting  The estimated value of the gift was  16 250 Satsuki Katayama  a Japanese politician in the House of Councillors  the upper house of Parliament  gave Ivanka Trump  the president s eldest daughter and a senior White House aide  a golf club engraved with an American flag and her name   Ivanka Marie Trump   Ms  Trump famously told Wendy Williams  an American TV host  in 2013 that her common interests with her father included real estate and golf The first lady and Ms  Trump  both known for their interest fashion  each received multiple designer handbags  And in 2017  King Abdullah II of Jordan presented the Trump grandchildren with a cigar box worth about  540 The most expensive gift given exclusively to Mr  Trump in 2017 was a  14 400 paper panel displaying five columns of black calligraphy  given to him by Mr  Xi in April 2017 When it comes to reciprocating  the United States is known to be  very chintzy   Mr  Feierstein said  While foreign governments regularly give bejeweled  hand painted gifts worth tens of thousands of dollars   we used to give glass eagles and things that are not nearly equivalent to what we get   he said In 2009  for instance  after Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain gave Mr  Obama a pen holder carved from the timber of an antislave ship  he received in return a box set of American movies on DVD  setting of a cycle of critical coverage in the British news media Gifts to the president are automatically turned over to the State Department  But presidents or their families are allowed to keep gifts if they purchase them from the government for the appraised value  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  would not say on Thursday whether Mr  Trump or any of his family members had purchased any of the gifts Some of the gifts appeared farcical  Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium gave Mr  Trump a framed cartoon that depicted a cowboy eating out of a frying pan  while Indians approach from behind 
American diplomacy is dangerously adrift  It s tempting to simply blame President Trump  His erratic leadership and narcissistic brand of diplomacy were on full display at the Hanoi summit with Kim Jong un of North Korea  Untethered to the judgments of his intelligence community  dismissive of careful preparation and transfixed by his powers of persuasion  the president gave Mr  Kim an unearned boost in stature and came home empty handed But the roots of America s diplomatic decay run deeper  and a cure will involve more than just seeing the back of Donald Trump For 33 years  under five presidents and 10 secretaries of state  I played a modest role in the wider drama of American foreign policy and its occasional diplomatic triumphs  Those peaks  however  overshadowed debilitating trends Our dominance in a more benign post Cold War environment lulled us into complacency  The shock of Sept  11 led us to rely even more on the American military as our tool of first resort  with diplomacy an afterthought with fewer and fewer resources We didn t make it any easier for ourselves at the State Department  We buried our agility and initiative with layer upon layer of bureaucracy  And as the costs of misadventures abroad became more obvious  a yawning gap emerged between a Washington establishment preaching the gospel of American indispensability and a skeptical American public President Trump channeled those frustrations and difficulties  fed them and made them infinitely worse  At precisely the time when diplomacy matters more than ever to American interests   when we are no longer the only country calling the shots   the president is engaged in unilateral diplomatic disarmament  hollowing out the idea of America  retreating from international commitments and disdaining the institutions and practitioners of diplomacy  Not surprisingly  adversaries are taking advantage  allies are hedging and the global order we did so much to shape and defend is teetering For all the damage we re doing to ourselves  it s not too late to shift course  We re no longer the singular dominant power that we were just after the Cold War  but we re still the pivotal player  We still have lots of assets  the world s best military  an economy that is bigger and more innovative than anyone else s  even though it is plagued by inequalities  and a capacity for alliances and coalition building unmatched by our rivals  We still have a window of American pre eminence before us  in which we can help shape international order to safeguard our interests and values  before others shape it for us What that requires is the revival of American diplomacy as our primary tool for navigating a more crowded  complicated and competitive world  That will not be easy  Diplomacy is among the oldest of professions  but also among the most misunderstood  It is by nature an unheroic  quiet endeavor  often unfolding in back channels out of sight and out of mind  Crises averted are less captivating than military victories  diplomacy s preventive care is less compelling than the military s surgical feats The Trump administration has made the formidable task of diplomatic renewal even harder and more urgent   embracing early on the biggest budget cuts in the modern history of the State Department  driving out many of its most capable senior and midlevel officers  cutting intake into the Foreign Service by more than half  leaving key ambassadorships and senior roles in Washington unfilled  reversing what was admittedly slow progress on gender and ethnic diversity  and blacklisting individual officers simply because they worked on controversial issues in the previous administration There is no neat alchemy to address President Trump s diplomatic malpractice  let alone decades of drift  but there are at least three imperatives First  we have to recapture the fundamentals of diplomatic tradecraft  Diplomats have been overwhelmed by existential angst  trying desperately to prove they are more than just village watchmakers in a smartwatch world  Over the course of my career  information exploded in pace and volume  the near monopoly on power of states was steadily eroded by nonstate actors   from the benign  like the Gates Foundation  to the malign  like Al Qaeda  and the near monopoly on presence and insight that diplomats used to have in foreign capitals also shrank  But the core roles and qualities of good diplomacy are not fundamentally different today from what they were in earlier eras Diplomats are classic organizers  harnessing all the levers of American influence  investing in alliances  mobilizing coalitions  endlessly adapting institutions and managing the gray area between peace and war  Even as the landscape shifts  the fundamentals   a nuanced grasp of history  mastery of foreign languages and facility in negotiations   remain indispensable Second  we urgently need to build modern capabilities on top of that traditional foundation  Recent efforts at transformation have tended to focus on the capillaries of institutional change  rather than the arteries  more on how we look than how we work  We need to strip down the State Department s bureaucracy and make it more nimble  We ought to invest heavily in 21st century skill sets so that we can better compete in the new global economy  cope with global challenges like climate change and maximize the benefits of the revolution in technology while minimizing its disruptions Third  we have to construct a new domestic compact between government and citizens about America s role in the world  and the utility of diplomacy in this new era  As we near the end of the second decade of a military campaign in Afghanistan and continue to wrestle with the consequences of the war in Iraq  Americans are naturally exasperated about the costs in blood and treasure  and the indiscipline that all too often belies our rhetoric about disciplined leadership  We have to demonstrate that diplomacy and international influence are aimed as much at enabling domestic renewal as they are at shoring up global order  We need to show that smart foreign policy not only begins at home  in the strength of our political and economic system  but ends there too   in better jobs  more prosperity  a healthier climate and greater security Getting beyond the age of Trump is a necessary  but not sufficient  condition for diplomacy s revival  We have to learn the lessons of not only Mr  Trump s demolition of diplomacy but also our frequent inattention to its significance over the past quarter century  Diplomacy at its best rarely swaggers  It s about quiet power  But if we re not louder about one of our nation s biggest assets and best kept secrets  we risk losing it

Bill Shine  the former Fox News executive who joined the White House staff last summer to manage President Trump s communications operation  has resigned and will move to the president s re election campaign  the White House announced Friday Mr  Shine s abrupt departure came as a surprise to many in the White House and was revealed  as such personnel moves often are in this administration  as the president was on Air Force One leaving Washington While described by admiring White House colleagues as a rare adult in the room  Mr  Shine has sometimes been absent during key moments  including the president s trip last week to Vietnam  Colleagues said he had developed little chemistry with Mr  Trump  and critics increasingly focused on Mr  Shine s ties to Fox  where he was forced out for his handling of sexual harassment claims In a meeting late Friday morning with communications staff members  Mr  Shine told colleagues that he was leaving for two reasons  according to a person familiar with what took place  He said that he lived a solitary existence in Washington and missed his family  who remained in New York  But the second reason  he said  was that he had become a distraction for Mr  Trump and did not see that changing The White House sought to present Mr  Shine s resignation as amicable and issued statements in the name of the president and other officials praising him  But people close to the White House described the campaign job as a way to save face  Bill Shine has done an outstanding job working for me and the administration   Mr  Trump said in his statement   We will miss him in the White House  but look forward to working together on the 2020 presidential campaign  where he will be totally involved  Thank you to Bill and his wonderful family  In the same statement  Mr  Shine was quoted calling his time in the White House an honor and  the most rewarding experience  of his life   I m looking forward to working on President Trump s re election campaign and spending more time with my family   he said Mr  Shine  who held the title of deputy White House chief of staff  was the sixth person to accept the job to manage communications for the Trump White House  a position that has been problematic given that Mr  Trump prefers to be his own chief spokesman and rarely sticks to a messaging plan that aides seek to establish  The White House gave no indication who will replace Mr  Shine Mr  Shine s presence in the White House was seen as emblematic of how closely Mr  Trump has aligned himself with Fox  a symbiotic relationship that drew a critical appraisal in a much read New Yorker article published this week  Mr  Trump has given the network about 45 interviews as president  using it to communicate with his most fervent supporters even as he embraces lines of argument that its hosts advance Mr  Trump regularly posts messages on Twitter reacting to reports he sees on Fox and has been said to privately talk on the phone with Sean Hannity  the network s marquee star  many nights after Mr  Hannity s show The line between the White House and Fox grew even blurrier last fall when Mr  Trump invited Mr  Hannity and another host  Jeanine Pirro  to join him onstage for a campaign rally  after which Mr  Shine and Mr  Hannity were seen sharing a high five  The president routinely praises Fox hosts from the podium during speeches  and according to The New Yorker article  he has privately rated Fox hosts on a scale of 1 to 10 based on their loyalty to him   Mr  Hannity got a 10  The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other Mr  Shine  who is personally close with Mr  Hannity  came into the White House with great fanfare last year  Initially  people there   particularly those close to John F  Kelly  then the White House chief of staff   described Mr  Shine favorably  saying he brought a mature presence to the team and  unusual for the White House  did not seem interested in seeking credit for himself But as time wore on  it became clearer that Mr  Shine had not developed a close relationship with Mr  Trump  The president frequently complained to other advisers that his news coverage had not improved  according to several people familiar with Mr  Trump s comments  And he was seen as ineffective  with few new ideas Mr  Shine attached himself to Ivanka Trump  the president s eldest daughter  and tried to help out with her media coverage  But an ABC News interview that she did included a question about how she and her husband  Jared Kushner  obtained their security clearances  which multiple White House officials said rankled her Mr  Trump s troubles recruiting and retaining communications chiefs have been striking even in a White House with the highest staff turnover in decades  Mr  Trump first gave the job after his election to a top campaign aide  Jason Miller  who backed out two days later after a campaign colleague disclosed on social media that he had impregnated her during an extramarital affair Sean Spicer  the White House press secretary  then held the position as a second job until Mr  Trump hired Michael Dubke  a longtime Republican operative  Mr  Dubke resigned after a few months  leaving Mr  Spicer to fill in again The most spectacular flameout came when Anthony Scaramucci  a brash and outspoken New York financier  was fired after just 11 days as communications director following a verbal tirade to a New Yorker reporter about other White House officials Putting aside her own reservations  Hope Hicks  one of Mr  Trump s most trusted aides  then took the job and held it until stepping down a year ago  the only person who was seen as successful at channeling the volatile president and maintaining the respect of her colleagues Mr  Shine had spent more than a year searching for another job after he was ousted from Fox amid the scandal surrounding Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly and the accusations of sexual harassment that were made against them  Mr  Shine was not himself accused of improper behavior  but was faulted for a culture that sought to cover it up  The White House became his road to redemption But Mr  Shine had increasingly been out of sight during key moments  including when the government shutdown began at the end of December  His wife  Darla  never relocated to Washington  and he was open about finding the travel away from her difficult As the president tweeted about legislators leaving town at the end of the year  Mr  Shine was in Hawaii on a vacation with his wife  More recently  after telling people he was traveling to Vietnam for the president s summit meeting with North Korea s leader  Kim Jong un  last week  Mr  Shine ended up staying behind As recently as two weeks ago  Mr  Shine was privately sharing his plans to revamp the White House communications shop with his allies in the administration  He said he wanted to  professionalize  a press team whose approach has often seemed ad hoc  according to a senior administration official who  like others  spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal dynamics  Mr  Shine also discussed streamlining the process to put more Trump surrogates on television Although he failed to build enduring ties with the president  Mr  Shine was well liked in the administration  in part because he would often bear the brunt of the president s criticism without trying to pass the blame on to others  a senior administration official said  Mr  Shine had also won the support of Mr  Trump s children  including Ms  Trump 
OAKLAND  Calif    Nearly nine months after the Trump administration officially rescinded its policy of separating migrant families who have illegally crossed the border  more than 200 migrant children have been taken from parents and other relatives and placed in institutional care  with some spending months in shelters and foster homes thousands of miles away from their parents The latest data reported to the federal judge monitoring one of the most controversial of President Trump s immigration policies shows that 245 children have been removed from their families since the court ordered the government to halt routine separations under last spring s  zero tolerance  border enforcement policy  Some of the new separations are being undertaken with no clear documentation to help track the children s whereabouts Images of crying mothers and children at the border last year prompted an intense backlash across party lines  with all four living former first ladies and Melania Trump expressing horror at the policy  But despite President Trump s June 20 executive order rescinding it  the practice was never completely suspended Under the original policy  most children were removed because parents who illegally crossed the border were subject to criminal prosecution  The recent separations have occurred largely because parents have been flagged for fraud  a communicable disease or past criminal history   in some cases relatively minor violations  years in the past  that ordinarily would not lead to the loss of parental custody  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border   a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  The new separations are taking place amid an unprecedented influx of migrant families from across the southern border that has highlighted the failure of the Trump administration s hard line policies to deter them  The Border Patrol detained 76 103 migrants in February  an 11 year high for that month  Among those intercepted were about 40 000 members of families  two thirds more than in January In Congress last week  Democrats grilled Kirstjen Nielsen  the Homeland Security secretary  over the separation policy  citing research that has found that separations from parents can inflict long term psychological harm on children Family separations also sometimes occurred under the Obama administration  but only rarely and in extreme cases in which a child s safety appeared to be at risk Customs and Border Protection officials say the separations are legal under the parameters set by the court and are intended to protect children  who they say may be threatened by human trafficking or by adults pretending to be a parent to capitalize on the advantage that gives them under American immigration laws  C B P  does not declare that a parent poses danger to a child arbitrarily or without merit   the agency said in a statement  It said agents  will maintain family unity to the greatest extent operationally feasible   separating children only in the presence of  a legal requirement  set out in written policy or  an articulable safety or security concern that requires separation  But opposition to the new separations has been growing from both outside and inside the federal government  At the Health and Human Services Department s Office of Refugee Resettlement  which oversees the care of separated children until they can be reunited with their families  some officials have tried to resist receiving children referred to the agency by the Border Patrol According to an official who was not authorized to discuss government business and spoke on the condition of anonymity  staff members have in some cases raised questions with Border Patrol agents about separations with what appear to be little or no justification  In some of those cases  border agents have refused to provide additional information  the official said  or if additional documents were provided  they were sometimes redacted to the point of illegibility The official  along with another staff member at the Department of Homeland Security  the Border Patrol s parent agency  said that some separations were occurring with no formal notification to the refugee resettlement office  Both officials said they had been made aware of concerns about an apparent inconsistency in standards applied by border agents when determining whether a family should be separated The failure to keep accurate records suggests that more children could have been separated than the 245 accounted for by Feb  20 in official records The New York Times reviewed several cases of children who have been separated since the policy was officially ended  and learned of many others through the lawyers who handled them  Some of the new separations  the review showed  occurred in families with a parent who had a drunken driving conviction in the past  or a 20 year old nonviolent robbery conviction  In one case  a parent had been convicted of possession of a small amount of marijuana Donna Abbott  vice president for refugee and immigrant services at Bethany Christian Services  a contractor that accommodates migrant children in temporary foster homes until they can be reunited with family members  said most cases of family separations do not list detailed reasons  making it difficult to evaluate whether they were appropriate For example  some files state only that the parent was suspected of having gang affiliations or a criminal history  without additional information   Is it trespassing or is it murder   Ms  Abbott said In December  a mother traveling from El Salvador with her three children was arrested and put on a bus to an immigration detention facility in Arizona while her children  ages 5  8 and 15  were sent to foster care in New York The woman  Deisy Ramirez  38  said it was nearly six weeks before she talked to her children They were  devastated   said Ms  Ramirez s sister  Silvia Ramirez  who was trying to persuade the government to allow her to take the children to live with her in Seattle while her sister was in custody   They couldn t understand why they were separated   she said On March 1  Ms  Ramirez s eldest daughter was transferred to a hospital after threatening to take her own life  Silvia Ramirez said  and she remained there even after her mother s release from detention last week  I never imagined this could happen   Deisy Ramirez said on Friday  her voice breaking   All I want is to hold my children and to be with them  Her lawyer  Ricardo de Anda  said he had received no response to his formal request for a reason for the separation  He suspects it may be connected to the fact that Ms  Ramirez had been deported from the United States more than a decade ago  He sent government lawyers a series of emails  ultimately securing her release On Saturday  the day after her release from the Arizona detention facility  Ms  Ramirez was preparing to fly to New York to reunite with her children Border agents removed 3 year old Ashley Ramos from her father after they were detained last month in Arizona  He was swiftly deported to Guatemala and the girl was sent to a shelter The child s mother  Silvia Maribel Ramos  who had been separated from the pair during their journey from Guatemala when Mexican police pulled her and other migrants off their bus for questioning  arrived in Arizona a few days later  only to learn from authorities that her child was gone  They told me they had no idea where she was  that I would find out after being released   said Ms  Ramos  who is staying with relatives in Oakland  Calif The child was located nearly two weeks later  she said  after her husband contacted Guatemalan authorities back home  Now Ms  Ramos is struggling with the paperwork required to recover Ashley   My daughter can t understand  She just weeps and begs to be with us   she said In late January  Victor Antonio Marin was separated from his 4 year old son  whose mother is deceased  after they were detained near Calexico  Calif  According to his lawyer  Bob Boyce  Mr  Marin had a 20 year old nonviolent robbery conviction in the United States that did not involve the use of a weapon  He served time and was deported back to El Salvador Now Mr  Marin remains locked up in an immigration detention center while his child is in a shelter in Texas Ruben Garcia  who runs a network of migrant shelters in El Paso  said that immigration authorities this month dropped off a distraught 18 year old woman from Guatemala The woman said she had given birth less than a week earlier and had been separated from her baby  Child welfare authorities had come to the hospital to take the child  who was a United States citizen  immigration agents took the mother back to a detention cell where she waited for several days  The baby s first two weeks were spent away from the mother  who finally regained custody after interventions from multiple legal aid groups  Mr  Garcia said Since Mr  Trump ended the family separations under  zero tolerance  on June 20  about 2 700 children have been reunited with their parents  Still  thousands more children who were separated before the policy officially went into effect have not been accounted for  according to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services  The investigators cited the lack of an efficient tracking system The American Civil Liberties Union requested that the government locate the families  and on Friday  Judge Dana M  Sabraw ruled that they should be included in the pending litigation over protecting and reuniting separated families  The hallmark of a civilized society is measured by how it treats its people and those within its borders   the judge wrote in his opinion Some families affected by the earlier zero tolerance separations continue to face repercussions A 9 year old Guatemalan boy named Byron Xol has been shuffled among four shelters since he was dragged away from his father at the border nine months ago  while the policy was still in place After his father was deported to Guatemala  the boy s parents decided that the child should remain in the United States for safety reasons  With the help of a lawyer  they designated an American family in Buda  Tex   to care for him But authorities have refused to allow Byron to join the family  citing an anti trafficking policy that bars a child from being released to a nonrelative sponsor unless the sponsor has a verifiable relationship with the child going back at least a year Detentions and deportation proceedings have also resulted in family separations far from the border Christy Swatzell  an immigration lawyer in Memphis  said that two of her clients who crossed the border without authorization and were released to await the outcome of their cases were told by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to leave their children at home ahead of their monthly check in with the agency  When they showed up at the I C E  office  they were detained and transferred to an immigration facility in Louisiana One of the clients  Francisca Yanes  33  is the mother of a 6 year old girl who is physically disabled   I was in tears  telling them about my daughter  But it didn t matter   said Ms  Yanes  whose child  Paola  remained in the care of family members for the entire 45 days she was in detention The Guatemalan migrant was released on a  7 500 bond set by the court after her lawyer filed a motion on her behalf   What we are seeing is that families are being effectively separated   said Ms  Swatzell   Just not at the border anymore  
WASHINGTON   The Trump administration said Thursday that it had revoked 77 more visas of individuals aligned with President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela in its rolling campaign against a leader who has thwarted humanitarian aid deliveries and aggressive American led efforts to install his replacement  In all  more than 250 visas have been revoked   Kimberly Breier  an assistant secretary of state  wrote on Twitter  confirming what Vice President Mike Pence had hinted at this week   We will continue to hold all of the Maduro regime accountable until democracy   freedom are fully restored in  Venezuela  The visa announcement is the latest in a series of relatively modest moves by Washington intended to slowly choke off Mr  Maduro s economic resources So far  the Trump administration has introduced weekly rounds of sanctions against individuals  including Venezuelan governors and members of Mr  Maduro s inner circle  who are accused of helping deflect foreign aid from entering the country  Venezuela is suffering from skyrocketing poverty  hyperinflation and an exodus of millions under Mr  Maduro s government On Thursday  Elliott Abrams  the administration s top envoy to Venezuela  also told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that officials were considering granting temporary protected status to roughly 74 000 Venezuelans seeking to enter the United States  We have this policy under review right now   Mr  Abrams said Just days earlier  however  the possibility of granting such entry to Venezuelans seeking political asylum in the United States was played down by John R  Bolton  the president s national security adviser  He believes toppling Mr  Maduro s government and installing Juan Guaidó  the Venezuelan opposition leader  will negate the need for asylum Trump administration officials plan to build on sanctions levied against Petróleos de Venezuela  S A   or Pdvsa  the state run oil company  as a next step that could prove politically fatal for Mr  Maduro And one senior administration official  who was not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy  said this week that more efforts were on the way to target Mr  Maduro s cash reserves  including stronger sanctions against banking institutions and networks that work with his government Despite the aggressive campaign by the United States  Mr  Maduro has shown few signs of leaving power  He also appeared relatively unfazed after a violent scuffle over humanitarian aid unfolded at the Colombia border two weeks ago In recent days  Mr  Maduro s government has taken steps to clamp down on journalists  On Wednesday  an American freelance journalist with Venezuelan residency rights was arrested and deported Mr  Guaidó  who returned this week to Venezuela without incident after a tour through Latin America to shore up support  has called for more street protests of Mr  Maduro this weekend amid continued attempts to deliver aid Mr  Maduro  for his part  has accused Mr  Guaidó of being a puppet for the Trump administration Facing a stubborn Maduro government  members of the Trump administration have hinted at military intervention  a path requested by Mr  Guaidó  The opposition leader has garnered the support of more than 50 countries to take over as Venezuela s interim president On Wednesday evening  Mr  Bolton said again on Twitter that President Trump was considering  all options    the latest assurance to Mr  Guaidó that military intervention could be a possibility  albeit a distant one But other administration officials have signaled that they will try to wait out Mr  Maduro  no matter how long that might take  There is no timeline   Mr  Pence told the Spanish channel Univision in an interview on Wednesday   Interim President Guaidó has assumed authority under their Constitution  but our focus is on seeing a restoration of the rule of law and democracy in Venezuela  
In his testimony before Congress last week  Michael Cohen in effect warned of a coup  Given my experience working for Mr  Trump  I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power   Cohen said That fit neatly into the concern in some liberal circles that President Trump may not simply undermine democracy but actually overturn it  References to the Nazi takeover of Germany have proliferated  and cautionary tales about fascism are now ubiquitous  including Madeleine Albright s  Fascism  A Warning  The polarization also leads Trump supporters to worry about a coup   by the  deep state  against Trump   and some make glib references about resorting to violence  We are in a civil war in this country   Joseph diGenova  a prominent conservative

just past the midpoint of the Trump presidency  I hope    it s worth examining how the country has weathered the challenge   and my take away is that American institutions and norms have shown impressive strength and resilience One of the most troubling elements of Trump s presidency has been his systematic assault on our institutions  the F B I   the Justice Department  the intelligence community  the news media  the courts  Yet for the most part  they have stood up to his bullying To take one example  Jane Mayer of The New Yorker reports that Trump in 2017 told aides to block a merger between AT T and Time Warner  apparently to punish CNN  a unit of Time Warner  for its news coverage while helping Fox News  This was utterly inappropriate  so aides ignored him  I ve mentioned it 50 times   Trump raged  according to Mayer s account   And nothing s happened  The Justice Department did in fact bring suit to block the merger  but courts foiled Trump and allowed it to go ahead Likewise  Trump s efforts to block meaningful investigations into his conduct have backfired  leading to the Robert Mueller inquiry and to congressional inquiries of obstruction of justice  His dangling of federal pardons before former associates encouraged state investigations  He has personally genuflected before Vladimir Putin  but his administration policy on Russia has ended up rather tougher  And his rogue behavior helped Democrats seize the House of Representatives Trump has regularly demonized journalists as  enemies of the people   but reporters have not been intimidated  As I ve often written  I thought we in the news media did not do well during the 2016 campaign  but the competition today between The Washington Post and The New York Times is the best kind of newspaper

asked how they think the U S  has done so far in the Trump presidency  The U S  is not 1930s Germany or contemporary Hungary  Venezuela  or Turkey   Levitsky told me   The U S  has much stronger democratic institutions than these countries  and it has a much stronger opposition  So whereas in Hungary and Venezuela autocrats steamrolled weak oppositions  Trump faced pushback on multiple fronts  including  very importantly  the electoral front in November 2018  So  yes  U S  democracy is hard to kill  Still  Levitsky and Ziblatt caution that an underlying polarization and erosion of norms made Trump s election possible  and they persist  Moreover  while the Democratic victory in the House is good news for accountability  it also results in a divided government that can t get anything done  U S  democracy is sliding into dysfunction   Levitsky said  noting that this can increase the appeal of other demagogues  Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell have also refused to stand up to Trump and have allowed certain authoritarian values to infect a wing of the party  Almost a quarter of Republicans said in a poll last year that  President Trump should close down mainstream news

LOS ANGELES   Creating yet another roadblock to the Trump administration s efforts to deport ineligible migrants  a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that immigration authorities can no longer swiftly deport asylum seekers who fail an initial screening  opening the door for thousands of migrants a year to get another shot in the federal courts to win asylum in the United States The ruling broadens constitutional protections for undocumented immigrants at the border and opens a new legal gateway for some of them to appeal for permission to stay in the country  even when an asylum officer and an immigration judge have made a determination that they do not have a credible fear of persecution in their homeland  The historical and practical importance of this ruling cannot be overstated   said Lee Gelernt  deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union s Immigrants  Rights Project  who argued the appeal on behalf of a Sri Lankan migrant who had been turned away at California s border with Mexico in 2017  He said the ruling  reaffirms the Constitution s foundational principle that individuals deprived of their liberty must have access to a federal court  After dropping precipitously over five decades  the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border   the key indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the United States   is soaring again  driven by an influx of families from Central America fleeing violence and poverty  Immigration authorities received more than 99 000 requests for asylum interviews during the 2018 fiscal year  including more than 54 000 submitted at the southwest border  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border   a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  President Trump has said that migrants are exploiting the asylum system by making baseless and fraudulent claims in order to remain in the United States  and his administration has taken a number of steps to make the process harder  including narrowing the grounds for winning asylum  limiting the number of asylum seekers who can be processed at the border each day and requiring some applicants to wait in Mexico while their cases make their way through the courts In 2016  the most recent year for which data is available  an estimated 7 200 migrants were denied permission to apply for asylum after their initial interviews and were placed in expedited deportation proceedings  An analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that in June 2018  only 15 percent of initial asylum reviews found that the asylum seeker had a credible fear of persecution  about half the proportion that had prevailed a year earlier Thursday s court decision will most likely send that trend in the other direction  legal analysts said  This is a historic decision   said Stephen Yale Loehr  an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School   But the government will surely appeal this to the Supreme Court  The opinion  from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  extends constitutional habeas corpus guarantees to those applying for asylum at the border and provides that they can seek a hearing in the federal courts before being summarily deported   though the court did not specify what standards the courts must use to evaluate such petitions The ruling applies to asylum seekers in the nine western states included in the court s jurisdiction and  because it conflicts with an earlier ruling rejecting such legal protections in the Third Circuit  the issue is likely to be resolved ultimately by the Supreme Court  In the meantime  legal analysts said  the court s decision is likely to have sweeping implications for immigration deterrence efforts by enabling thousands to remain in the country while they seek the court review Under current procedure  every migrant who arrives at the border and expresses a fear of persecution in his or her homeland is referred for an interview with an asylum officer  Those who succeed in convincing the officer that they have a credible fear are allowed to enter the country and proceed with their asylum cases in the immigration courts  Those who don t can request a review by an immigration judge  but it is usually cursory and favorable decisions are rare  There is usually no access to a lawyer  and no opportunity to challenge the decision  deportation quickly ensues In the case before the appeals court  Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam  a member of Sri Lanka s Tamil ethnic minority  was arrested about 25 yards north of the border near San Ysidro  Calif   and told an asylum officer that he was fearful of returning to his homeland  The officer found no credible fear  and that finding was upheld by a supervisor and an immigration judge Mr  Thuraissigiam was in deportation proceedings when he filed a habeas corpus petition in the federal court  He argued that the asylum officer had failed to elicit important background about his case  including that he had been detained and beaten by Sri Lankan army officers on two occasions  and at one point had been lowered into a well and nearly drowned  He also said there were communication problems between the translator and both the asylum officer and the immigration judge As a result  his lawyers argued  he was deprived of  a meaningful right to apply for asylum  A district court judge in Los Angeles rejected that argument  but the three judge appeals court panel  sitting in San Francisco  held that even though an asylum seeker may lack the right to a full trial in immigration court  the Constitution requires a more complete review than what immigration law currently provides At its  historical core   said the 48 page opinion written by Judge A  Wallace Tashima   the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention  and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest  
 Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  DES MOINES   The sharp left turn in the Democratic Party and the rise of progressive presidential candidates are unnerving moderate Democrats who increasingly fear that the party could fritter away its chances of beating President Trump in 2020 by careening over a liberal cliff Two months into the presidential campaign  the leading Democratic contenders have largely broken with consensus driven politics and embraced leftist ideas on health care  taxes  the environment and Middle East policy that would fundamentally alter the economy  elements of foreign policy and ultimately remake American life Led by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  a democratic socialist who is the top candidate in the race at this early stage  many vocal leaders in the party are choosing to draw lessons from liberal victories in 2018 rather than the party s breakthroughs in moderate suburban battlegrounds that delivered Democratic control of the House These progressive Democrats risk playing into Mr  Trump s hands   he has repeatedly branded them  socialists    yet they argue that their ambitious agenda can inspire a voter revolt in 2020 that elects a left wing president  Those ideas that we talked about here in Iowa four years ago that seemed so radical at the time  remember that   Mr  Sanders  returning to Iowa this week for the first time as a 2020 candidate  crowed on Thursday   Shock of all shocks  those very same ideas are now supported not only by Democratic candidates for president but by Democratic candidates all across the board  from school board on up   Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  The sprint toward populism amounts to a rejection of the incremental and often defensive brand of politics that has characterized the party s approach to highly charged issues for 40 years  Yet when nearly half of voters indicate in polls that they will not support the president s re election  many moderates say the cautious strategy in 2018 that helped the party pick up 21 House seats that Mr  Trump carried two years earlier should be the playbook for next year  What we saw in the midterms is a lot of people from the center and moderate part of the party really win and take back the House   said Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire  alluding to the careful and poll tested campaigns many Democrats in Republican leaning districts ran last year   We need to make sure we re being as pragmatic as we can  This moderate wing of the party lacks an obvious standard bearer  Former Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg of New York  who would have run a centrist campaign  begged off this week  Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio  a Midwestern progressive who favors a within the system style of pragmatic politics  also decided not to run  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  who is running  has presented herself as a centrist but has not yet gained traction ImageSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has presented herself as a centrist but has not gained traction in the Democratic presidential race CreditElizabeth Frantz for The New York TimesShould former Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  enter the race  as his top advisers vow he soon will  he would have the best immediate shot at the moderate mantle   And if he does not run  Democrats like former Gov  Terry McAuliffe of Virginia or Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo of New York might try to seek that role  Mr  Biden s candidacy would immediately thrust a fundamental dispute to the center of the Democratic race  Do Americans simply pine for a pre Trump equilibrium  less chaos and more consensus  or do the yawning disparities of these times call out for a more transformational administration  Read more  A  beat Trump  fervor is producing big turnouts for 2020 Democrats  Mr  Sanders and other Democratic candidates  like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  are plainly wagering that voters want more than a return to normalcy  In 2016 Iowa helped begin the political revolution   Mr  Sanders recalled on Saturday at a rally in Des Moines  referring to his near victory in the state s caucuses that year   Now as we move to 2020 our job is to complete that revolution  The liberal candidates have dominated the policy debate in the race so far  Ms  Warren proposed on Friday that the government break up big tech giants like Amazon and Facebook  the latest  and perhaps boldest  proposal to come from her campaign  And Mr  Sanders s platform    Medicare for all   free college tuition and an aggressive plan to combat climate change   has grown in popularity  according to polls Speaking at the University of Iowa as part of his campaign swing  Mr  Sanders also took aim at  establishment Democrats  and won his loudest and most sustained applause by pledging to push through his universal health care bill Mr  Sanders and Ms  Warren  along with a new generation of high profile progressives like Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York  have emerged this winter as the clearest and most vocal arbiters of Democratic aspirations  if not the immediate congressional agenda They are  at least  hastening the tectonic shifts taking place in the party  It was no accident that House Democrats modified a resolution targeting Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota   for her controversial claim that pro Israel advocates carry an  allegiance  to a foreign country   after Ms  Ocasio Cortez  other lawmakers of color and the party s leading presidential hopefuls rebelled against singling out Ms  Omar  The episode marked a striking departure from the down the line support for Israel that has characterized the upper ranks of most Democratic primaries Relying on wealthy donors has also been standard fare  and unremarkably so  in past White House races  But Mr  Sanders elevated the issue of campaign finance in his 2016 race  and his jeremiads against the billionaire class have all but made super PACs verboten in this race  he and Ms  Warren are refusing to hold high dollar fund raisers Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts  who won her seat after defeating an incumbent Democrat last year  conceded that the first months of 2019 had inflicted  growing pains  on Democrats  but she argued it was merely a necessary side effect in the party s evolution  After we build that muscle  we re going to flex it   Ms  Pressley said Yet Mr  Biden  in speeches at home and abroad  has used much of the first part of this year pledging to restore the dignity he believes that the country has lost in the Trump years  promising a restoration rather than a revolution  And  as his supporters put it less subtly  his campaign would represent something else  Overwhelmingly  the primary electorate of the Democratic Party wants to win   Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said  He argued that Mr  Biden could  repair a lot of the ways in which our position in the world has been harmed  while offering a  hopeful  optimistic  positive  vision at home that would heal the divisions he said Mr  Trump has exacerbated To such moderate Democrats  the most instructive recent election is not that of Mr  Trump in 2016 but rather the 2018 midterms  when many of the Democrats who won in battleground House districts and governor s races were decidedly less confrontational than Mr  Sanders  The overwhelming majority of seats we picked up were by center left candidates representing more centrist type districts   said Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania  adding   There s still lots of folks on our side who are O K  with compromise  Other Democrats are even blunter  fretting that the party risks alienating the broad middle of the electorate at a moment Mr  Trump is making no attempt to appeal to such voters  You live for the day in politics when the other guy is conceding the majority of the country   said Larry Grisolano  a longtime Democratic strategist Yet for many Democrats   especially younger voters who have largely known only Mr  Trump and another once unlikely president for eight years before that   it is a hopelessly outdated notion that the party must be prudent about who it nominates and tread only within centrist confines on animating issues like climate change  racial justice and universal health care  These progressives have no more experience with a right of center  Reagan era framework than their parents did with the New Deal  We have had enough of the centrist  corporatist Democratic   the type of Democrat that my mom would have voted for back in the  90s   said Jake Peters  a 23 year old Iowan and Sanders volunteer who drove two hours to see him speak in Council Bluffs this week   We just don t have patience for the platitudes  And Mr  Trump has emboldened these young activists  heightening the urgency they feel about enacting a progressive agenda  and convincing them that Mr  Sanders s blunt force message about injustice is what s needed to defeat the president  Chris Kivlahan  22  who came to the Iowa City rally  described a Sanders presidency this way   I think if it s going to happen  now is the time and Trump is the candidate to be running against  Democrats in Washington are seeing the tensions within the party firsthand as they try to balance an agenda that their newly elected moderates can support while also mollifying more liberal newcomers who are eager to impeach Mr  Trump and pursue far reaching goals  such as the Green New Deal ImagePresidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mr  Sanders are plainly wagering that Democratic voters want more than a return to normalcy CreditElizabeth Frantz for The New York Times A lot of young people have come into a world where there was more diversity  more opportunities and where they had use of social media   said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland about the expectations of next generation activists and lawmakers  some of whom serve on the oversight committee he chairs   A guy like me  I had to fight to even get in the door  To tell some of these younger Democrats that a uncompromising progressive platform may be unattainable  let alone who can and cannot be elected president  is difficult given Mr  Trump s victory and the chasm they see between the scale of the problems they will confront and the policies in place today And unlike many in the party s pragmatic wing  these Democrats believe the recipe for success in the general election is not to nominate another seemingly safe candidate like Hillary Clinton  who was unable to galvanize the base and lost crucial votes to a Green Party nominee  but to put forward somebody who will energize reluctant voters  Obviously we ve shown that we re at a place where we re O K  with nontraditional candidates   said Riley Wilson  a 29 year old Nebraskan who crossed the Missouri River to see Mr  Sanders  He added   I think so many people just aren t involved at all in politics  and I think he would be able to bring some of those people into the fold because they ll feel like they have options that they haven t had before  politically speaking  And about the Republican strategy  led by Mr  Trump himself  to pin the  socialism  label on the Democrats in 2020 Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it was mostly just his party s elite  donor class  that had anything to fear from a sweeping  progressive agenda Well  them and the arbiters of conventional political wisdom  he added  What we ve learned from last two presidential elections is that nobody knows anything   Mr  Schatz said of the election of former President Barack Obama and Mr  Trump   The people who write op eds and stroke their chins and tell us how to win are the people who have been getting it wrong for almost two decades now  
SHREVEPORT  La    Transgender troops like Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher are seen as  an unreasonable burden  by the Trump administration  It says their presence hurts morale and the military s ability to fight  and that they have no place in uniform That s news to Airman Crutcher  He just got back from a deployment with his B 52 bomber squadron  and when he did  fellow airmen in his squadron  whom he counts among his best friends  threw a shower for him and his wife  Aimee  to celebrate their first child  born in February  Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty  conflict and consequence   At my level  it s not an issue   Airman Crutcher  30  said about serving while transgender   I can meet and exceed all the standards  and the people I work with  they like me  They have a lot of questions  but they don t have a problem  This has been an uneasy time for transgender troops in the United States military  caught between a commander in chief who wants them out and court injunctions that  at least temporarily  said they could stay   The last of the injunctions was lifted on Thursday  But dozens of transgender troops like Airman Crutcher said in interviews that they felt supported in the service  Their comrades and commanders have welcomed them  they said  and the military has often been more accepting than the homes and neighborhoods they left to enlist Nearly 1 000 troops officially deemed as transgender are currently serving in the American military  according to the Defense Department  and another 228 are in the process of enlisting  They are all over the globe in a wide spectrum of roles   infantry officers  armor platoon leaders  drill sergeants  intelligence specialists  Arabic linguists  nuclear reactor operators  A transgender instructor teaches leadership at the Naval Academy They started coming out publicly in 2016 when the military lifted a longtime ban  after concluding that doing so would have no significant negative impact on budgets or operations  But President Trump announced an abrupt reversal of policy on Twitter a year later  saying he would no longer allow transgender troops to serve  in any capacity  The Defense Department laid out its arguments for excluding transgender troops before the House Armed Services Committee late last month  James N  Stewart  a senior Pentagon official  testified that transgender troops were more prone to mental health issues than other troops  and that when they transition  medical treatments can make them nondeployable for months   factors that he said would make recruits ineligible to serve if they stemmed from other kinds of pre existing health conditions ImageAirman Crutcher worked out at a gym near his home   I can meet and exceed all the standards  and the people I work with  they like me   he said of his military service CreditAnnie Flanagan for The New York TimesMr  Stewart  who is a retired Air Force general  rejected calling the policy a ban  saying that the policy drafted after the president s Twitter announcement still allows transgender troops to serve  as long as they never transition He argued that having troops who have transitioned in the ranks could also raise complicated questions about physical fitness standards and access to shower and bathroom facilities that may upset others  leading  to unnecessary and debilitating leadership challenges  Other troops and military leaders disagree  Five transgender troops who also testified at the hearing said that  aside from the uncertainty created by the change in policy  they had encountered few problems transitioning in uniform  Instances of harassment have been few  according to Sparta  an association of transgender troops And in testimony before the Senate last spring  the heads of the Army  Navy  Air Force and Marine Corps all said they were not aware of any issues caused by having transgender troops serving openly Airman Crutcher says that few people outside his unit realize he is transgender  He relaxes on weekends by playing video games and has Airsoft gun battles with the other troops from his unit  There s nothing remarkable about him either way   said Senior Airman Kyle Daily  who serves in the same squadron   There are some people in the unit who don t agree with what he is  but they re the minority  Many transgender recruits come from socially conservative small towns or strict religious upbringings  and have spent their youth feeling like misfits  Some troops who were born anatomically male said in interviews that they enlisted with the initial hope that military service would drum feminine feelings out of them  I hoped it would straighten me out   I didn t want my family to hate me   said Aylanna Anderson  an Air Force staff sergeant who was raised Catholic in a tiny West Texas town and became an Eagle Scout   I hoped I could leave what I saw as this dark part of me behind  ImageAirman Crutcher says that few people outside his unit realize that he is transgender CreditAnnie Flanagan for The New York TimesTo her surprise  after enlisting in 2012  Sergeant Anderson said  she found a culture that emphasized judging people by ability  not identity  She began to transition to female in 2017  The military has been very freeing   she said by phone from Kunsan Air Base in South Korea  where she repairs electronics in F 16 fighters   I don t know if I could have done it otherwise  Airman Crutcher  who grew up in a Pentecostal household in rural Missouri  said he wrote a heartfelt letter to his family about his lifelong sense of being a boy in a girl s body  but they refused to read it  asking him instead if he was on drugs By contrast  when he came out to his Air Force commander  he said the reaction was   What do I need to do for you  I want to make sure you are supported  A few days back from a deployment to Guam with his bomber squadron  he was shopping for a crib with his pregnant wife when they got a text from his mother But it wasn t his birth mother  who he says essentially disowned him after he told her in 2015 that he was transgender  It was his Air Force mother   Kim Thomas  the wife of a lieutenant colonel  who informally adopted him after meeting him during basic training  He now spends holidays with her family and calls her Mom  She s the best   Airman Crutcher said as he leaned over his wife s phone to see the photo Ms  Thomas had sent of a new outfit for the baby   It was life changing to have that support of family who love me no matter what  Ms  Thomas said taking Airman Crutcher under her wing came naturally   Here is this amazing kid who volunteered to fight and die for our country   she said   We are not going to allow him to go through the military without support  ImageCapt  Alivia Stehlik  an Army physical therapist stationed at Fort Carson  Colo  She said her transition should be seen as an asset  not a burden CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesA 2016 RAND Corporation study found that nearly one fifth of transgender troops do not plan to transition medically  Those who do transition may  depending on gender and preference  undergo hormone therapy  breast removal and other procedures  like surgery to make facial features and voices more gender appropriate  All are covered by the military Transitioning troops can also request surgery to change their genitals  but the approval process and recovery time can be lengthy  The Defense Department did not respond to questions about how many such gender reassignment procedures had been performed on troops since the ban was lifted in 2016  Sparta estimates the figure at about six The cost and disruption associated with surgery is a chief complaint of critics  but the  RAND study estimated that those factors would be negligible  with fewer than 200 active troops transitioning per year at a total cost of less than  10 million  In interviews  troops who have transitioned said they tried to time their surgical procedures for scheduled lulls in unit activity  and sometimes put them off because of deployments or demanding work assignments Even so  transitioning can detour careers  Some Sparta members said they had been removed from sensitive jobs such as pilots  air traffic controllers or nuclear missile operators  out of concern that they might be mentally unstable Regulations can get in the way  as well  Airman Crutcher was sent home early from a 2016 deployment to Qatar when medical staff discovered that the testosterone treatments he was receiving violated a rule about injected medications for troops deployed in the region  I was crushed   he said   My major called me in and said he had fought for me to stay  but it was regulations  Capt  Alivia Stehlik is a transgender woman who graduated from West Point as a man in 2008  completed the Army s punishing Ranger School and led an infantry platoon  She is now an Army physical therapist stationed at Fort Carson  Colo In an interview at her home  she said her transition should be seen as an asset  not a burden She volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan with an infantry brigade last spring after the unit s regular physical therapist became pregnant  Captain Stehlik spent nearly a year hopping helicopters from base to base  treating sprains and other injuries with a medical bag in one hand and an M 4 rifle in the other Six foot three and broad shouldered  she said it would have been pretty obvious to the 1 700 soldiers she treated that she was transgender  but it was never a problem  It s not just

For President Trump  the era of congressional oversight is shaping up to be a family affair  with his three eldest children   Donald Jr   Ivanka and Eric   at risk of getting swept up in multiple investigations  But none of the Trump clan may face a more thorough going over than Jared Kushner  the president s son in law and top White House adviser Mr  Kushner this week was among a long list of Trumpworld intimates asked to provide documents to the House Judiciary Committee as it looks into possible presidential misdeeds This request landed just as the continuing tussle was heating up between Mr  Kushner and the House Oversight and Reform Committee  which is examining claims that Mr  Trump arranged to have his son in law granted top secret security clearance over the objections of intelligence officials In both cases  the White House has signaled its intent to defy Congress  arguing executive privilege and legislative overreach  On Monday  the White House counsel  Pat Cipollone  sent a letter to the oversight committee chairman  Elijah Cummings  rebuffing his request and effectively daring him to start issuing subpoenas  Mr  Cummings said he would confer with colleagues to determine what comes next However Democrats proceed  Mr  Kushner s peculiar role in his father in law s White House has prompted widespread concern that is both broader and more specific than the generic questions of accountability and competence often raised by raw nepotism Unease about Mr  Kushner s access to secret information appears to go beyond politics  Mr  Trump s own intelligence officials are said to have balked at the idea of giving his son in law such access  as did Donald McGahn during his stint as White House counsel Mr  Trump overrode such advice and ordered Mr  Kushner s clearance granted  which it was last May These were not casual  offhand objections  After the president made his decision  Mr  McGahn was reportedly so troubled that he wrote an internal memo detailing the concerns about Mr  Kushner   including from the C I A    and making clear that he had recommended against the move John Kelly  at that time the White House chief of staff  is said to have felt similarly moved to write a memo stating that he had been explicitly  ordered  by the president to grant Mr  Kushner s clearance If true  this is yet another point on which Mr  Trump has misled the public  insisting in January that he had played no role in arranging his son in law s clearance  Just last month  Ivanka Trump made a similar claim  asserting that her father  had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband s clearance  zero  Those untruths are nowhere near as troubling as the fact that intelligence and administration officials were reportedly loath to grant Mr  Kushner access to the government s deepest secrets What was the C I A  s specific hesitation concerning Mr  Kushner and top secret information  Why does the agency continue to deny him access to  sensitive compartmentalized information   Why did the F B I  raise questions about foreign influence over Mr  Kushner As The Times reported last month  The full scope of intelligence officials  concerns about Mr  Kushner is not known  But the clearance had been held up in part over questions from the F B I  and the C I A  about his foreign and business contacts  including those related to Israel  the United Arab Emirates and Russia  according to multiple people familiar with the events   Mr  Kushner s inaccurate statements to the F B I  about his foreign interactions are cause for additional concern And many  many eyebrows have been raised over Mr  Kushner s special friendship with Mohammed bin Salman  the crown prince of Saudi Arabia   a coziness strategically and aggressively cultivated by the Saudis  Out of fear that Mr  Kushner  naïve in the ways of diplomacy and foreign affairs  was susceptible to manipulation by the prince  Mr  Kelly attempted to curtail the two men s private talks by reinstating a requirement that National Security Council officials participate in calls with foreign leaders  No matter  Mr  Kushner and Prince Mohammed s bond grew  even withstanding the conclusion by American intelligence agencies that the prince ordered the torture and murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi  Amid global outrage over the killing  Mr  Kushner has been among the prince s fiercest defenders Mr  Kushner is not a low level White House functionary  He has been charged with bringing peace to the Middle East  and he is the president s star emissary to the Saudi government  The public has a compelling interest in knowing what made the intelligence community so nervous about him  Putting a member of the president s family in the investigatory hot seat is a delicate business  Voters can get squeamish watching a politician s wife or daughter or son in law field tough questions  That s no excuse for letting them avoid

Chris Wallace sounded a little bit wistful  and a little bit wry  I m disappointed   he said by telephone on Thursday   There would have been a certain man bites dog quality to it  the Democrats showing up on Fox  But Mr  Wallace  the  Fox News Sunday  moderator  had to put aside his hope for a Fox News sponsored Democratic primary debate on Wednesday  when Democratic officials rejected the idea in an unusually sharp rebuke  To be banned  or boycotted  for the 12 debates over the next year  is kind of stunning   he said in his first extended comments on the matter   There are a lot of voters that a Democrat is going to need to get elected president who watch Fox News  People in the Rust Belt states  the rural areas that Hillary Clinton lost  They would have been able to see the Democratic candidates make their arguments about why they re better able to represent their interests  The Democratic chairman  Tom Perez  attributed his rejection of Fox News in part to an article published by The New Yorker that  he wrote  chronicled  the inappropriate relationship between President Trump  his administration and Fox News  Mr  Wallace   a formidable interviewer who in 2016 became the first Fox News journalist to moderate a general election debate   seemed dubious about that  Do I think Tom Perez read the New Yorker article and suddenly said   Oh  my gosh  there s gambling going on in the back room   No   he said   There is a visceral antipathy to Fox News among the left wing of the Democratic Party  and I think they saw this as a good opportunity to make a decision that I m sure the D N C  was under a lot of pressure to make  Fox News has had poor luck persuading Democrats to allow its journalists   who  the network says  operate separately from its partisan pundits   to host an official forum for the party s presidential candidates  Executives there spent months lobbying Democratic officials for a 2020 opportunity  though its prospects this time looked dimmer than ever After all  Mr  Trump is a devoted viewer who responds in real time to  Fox   Friends   counts a former Fox News co president as his deputy chief of staff  dines at the White House with Fox News stars like Sean Hannity and Jesse Watters  consults with Fox News commentators on policy decisions and sees his talking points beamed back at him every weeknight during the Fox News prime time block Image To be banned  or boycotted  for the 12 debates over the next year  is kind of stunning   said Chris Wallace  the  Fox News Sunday  moderator CreditIlya S  Savenok Getty ImagesSo  do the Democrats kind of have a point  I can understand where some of the programming on Fox News  at various parts of the day  would give Democrats heartburn   Mr  Wallace said   I can also understand why there s programming on in parts of the day on CNN and MSNBC   or  frankly  on the broadcast networks   that would give Donald Trump and Republicans heartburn  The question is  can you distinguish between the serious straight news reporters and the opinion people   he added  noting that Rachel Maddow  the liberal opinion host  co moderated an NBC News debate with Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016  Sean Hannity and our other opinion people aren t going to be onstage with the candidates   Mr  Wallace added  of a potential Fox News debate Mr  Perez  the Democratic chairman  went out of his way to praise Mr  Wallace during a pair of TV appearances on Wednesday  telling Chris Hayes on MSNBC that  my concern is not about Chris Wallace   it s about people above Chris Wallace   Mr  Wallace said that he expected Mr  Perez to return to his  Fox News Sunday  program  and that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had agreed to appear  as well  While some liberals expressed glee at the Democrats  decision  the CNN host Chris Cuomo on Wednesday subjected Mr  Perez to an on air grilling about the logic behind his decision   It seems like you re just asking for more division in a campaign season that s supposed to be about trying to find ways have less division   Mr  Cuomo said  I see my role as making sure that everything we do is ensuring that our candidates are treated fairly   Mr  Perez replied The president also weighed in  piping up on Twitter to threaten a boycott of debates moderated by  Fake News Networks  in the general election  This does give President Trump a pretty good excuse to decide if and when he ll do debates in the general election   Mr  Wallace said   If the Democrats are going to boycott certain venues  maybe the president will  too   I think that d be a huge mistake  I think that d be bad for the country   he added   But the Democrats have opened the door to the president being able to say now we re going to pick and choose where we answer questions from  
WASHINGTON   The House passed the Democrats  showcase anti corruption and voting rights legislation on Friday  an expansive measure that aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box  end big money in politics and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials The sweeping legislation  passed 234 193  makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington that helped catapult Democrats into the majority  It also serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020  It has virtually no chance of passing the Senate  It s a power grab for the American people   said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California  who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation The ambitious compendium  at nearly 700 pages  includes proposals designating Election Day as a federal holiday  automatically registering citizens to vote  and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences  It also creates a six to one matching system for donations of up to  200 to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high dollar contributions  funded by an additional fine on corporations found to have broken the law Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill   called the For the People Act or H R  1  to underscore its primacy   and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  has branded it the  Democrat Politician Protection Act  in weekly speeches  and pledged not to take up the legislation  The House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  also criticized the legislation  This bill is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections   Mr  McCarthy said in a speech on Friday  in an attack on  this new  Democrat  socialist majority  Some of the most debated provisions are intended to reveal who funds online political ads and finances so called dark money groups  The Disclose Act  part of the bill  would require super PACs and nonprofit organizations that spend money in elections to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than  10 000  Democrats say such disclosure is broadly popular with voters across the political spectrum ImageRepresentative Ayanna Pressley  Democrat of Massachusetts  proposed an amendment that would have lowered the voting age in federal elections to 16 CreditErin Schaff The New York Times Congress cannot meaningfully address the nation s significant challenges without first recognizing and acknowledging the undue influence of special interests in our politics   said Representative Abigail Spanberger  Democrat of Virginia Some of those provisions  however  have drawn criticism from both conservative and liberal groups that argue the language is overly broad and would infringe on First Amendment rights  The American Civil Liberties Union urged members to vote against the bill Democrats have also used the legislation to make clear that they believe that cleanup must start with the White House  and included several provisions jabbing at the president and homing in on a laundry list of his administration s alleged ethical abuses It would require presidents and vice presidents  as well as candidates for the nation s highest offices  to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns   Mr  Trump has released none   and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures And an amendment sponsored by Representative Raul Ruiz of California would prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned or controlled by the president  the vice president or any cabinet official  Federal agencies spent about  13 million on four of Mr  Trump s trips to his Mar a Lago resort in Florida in early 2017  according to a report by a nonpartisan congressional watchdog agency issued last month Two other measures also zero in on the costs of administration officials  travel  One provision would require the Defense Department to regularly report to Congress details of the costs of presidential travel  the other would prohibit political appointees from using federal funds to pay for travel on noncommercial or private flights for official business  We must hold our government leaders to the highest standards  and with so many high profile ethics violations in the past years  it is clear we have failed to do that   Representative Tom O Halleran  Democrat of Arizona and the sponsor of the amendments  said in a statement Democrats also successfully put down an attempt by Republicans to divide the caucus and tar the legislation with a resolution expressing the sense that  allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens  Republicans have repeatedly ambushed Democrats   twice successfully   with politically freighted procedural motions in a drive to divide Democrats and draw out vulnerable swing district members  But determined not to let that taint their signature legislation and fired up by a rousing speech from freshman Representative Max Rose of New York  Democrats held steady

BEIJING   President Trump says he is optimistic that a landmark trade deal with China is close  Chinese officials are not so sure The two sides in recent weeks agreed to the broad outlines of an agreement that would roll back tariffs in both countries  with China buying more American goods and opening up some markets to foreign goods  The trade deal looks like a good one for Beijing  since it would largely spare the government from making substantive changes to its economy But some of the biggest details   like the enforcement mechanism to ensure China complies and the timing for the removal of tariffs   still haven t been hammered out  Beijing officials are wary that the final terms may be less favorable  especially given Mr  Trump s propensity for last minute changes  according to two people familiar with China s position  The work team is still continuing to negotiate because we still have a lot to do   Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said on the sidelines of the 11 day annual session of the National People s Congress  which began on Tuesday  At the legislative meeting  senior Chinese officials have been taking turns warning that challenges remain The emerging gap is starting to put in doubt plans for President Xi Jinping to meet with Mr  Trump in late March or early April to sign a deal Chinese officials face an obvious dilemma in asking their president to fly all the way to Mr  Trump s Mar a Lago club in Florida without a clear understanding of the final details  And persuading Mr  Xi to attend such a summit meeting is no easy task  given his imperative of appearing strong before a domestic audience  If they re going to send their president all the way to Florida  they have to know there s an agreement in the end   said James Green  who until August was the top trade official at the United States Embassy in Beijing and is now a fellow at Georgetown University Mr  Trump s meeting last week with the North Korean leader  Kim Jong un  in Hanoi  Vietnam  serves as a cautionary tale  The meeting ended abruptly when the American president decided the North Koreans were not offering sufficient terms Over the past two years  Chinese negotiators have also repeatedly believed they had a deal  only for it to come apart at the last minute  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the summer of 2017 presented a plan  which Mr  Trump quickly disavowed  They thought they had an understanding with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last year  focused on cars and financial services  and then Mr  Trump imposed tariffs It s a difficult position for the Chinese  who want to avoid an embarrassment  Mr  Trump is unpredictable  and China can t be assured he won t change his mind when the two presidents meet But the Chinese also recognize that a presidential summit meeting may be the only path to completing a deal  since Mr  Trump has a tendency to undercut his advisers  A common view in China is that  Donald Trump is very interested in doing a deal himself   said Bo Zhiyue  the deputy dean of the New Era Development Research Institute at Xi an Jiaotong Liverpool University in Suzhou  China ImageChinese Premier Li Keqiang delivers a speech during the opening of the National People s Congress on Tuesday CreditAndrea Verdelli Getty ImagesThe United States and China have discussed holding further discussions in Beijing a few days after the National People s Congress ends on March 15  two people close to the trade talks said Michael Pillsbury  a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration  said that Mr  Xi s silence on the trade talks was an ominous sign  and that several of the points that the United States thought China had agreed to were far from settled  There may be the need for another round of talks before the signing summit   Mr  Pillsbury said The biggest barrier to a deal continues to be the enforcement of terms  people familiar with the discussions said  The United States has insisted that it retain the right to raise tariffs if China violates the agreement  without retaliation by Beijing  But some Chinese officials have criticized the arrangement as a potential infringement of China s sovereign rights  There are also disagreements over whether Beijing is going far enough in its promises to curb the forced transfer of American intellectual property as a condition of doing business in China Precisely how tariffs would be rolled back is still in play  too  If its conditions are met  the American negotiating team has signaled that it will lift 10 percent tariffs on roughly  200 billion of Chinese goods that Mr  Trump imposed last autumn  people familiar with the discussions said  But the fate of 25 percent tariffs imposed last summer on an additional  50 billion of goods is less clear  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  also prefers to roll back its tariffs over time as China makes changes to its law and economy  while China is arguing for them to be lifted altogether when the deal is signed  according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations Chinese officials are leery of continued talks  since they don t have to give up much under the current  albeit tenuous  agreement  And they do not want to commit China to structural changes in its economy  according to three people familiar with the negotiations The emerging deal would allow China to sign long term contracts for the purchase of oil  gas  soybeans and other natural resources that its economy needs and cannot easily produce at home  It wouldn t require Beijing to buy large volumes of American manufactured goods  which could threaten jobs in China s vast but slowing manufacturing sector The agreement would also do little to limit China s government programs to assist the development of high tech manufacturing  China sees its economy s long running evolution toward such industries as essential to creating the high paying jobs that its increasingly educated work force has begun to expect In a bid to appease Mr  Trump  China shelved last year the term for the initiative   Made in China 2025   The term had become a lightning rod for criticism in the United States  Premier Li Keqiang did not use it in his annual address to the National People s Congress on Tuesday  after using it in previous years  Asked about the omission of  Made in China 2025   Huang Shouhong  the director of the State Council Research Office and leader of the team that drafted the speech  said there was not room in the speech for every issue If the United States presses too hard  Beijing is also likely to take the position that no deal is better than a deal that could limit China s economic development  And it is preparing for that possibility The national budget outlined by Mr  Li on Tuesday includes corporate tax cuts and extra lending from the government controlled banking sector  That could help them weather trade frictions  however long they last  and bounce back from a recent credit crunch that has particularly affected smaller private companies Four fifths of the savings from the main corporate tax cut announced on Tuesday will ultimately flow to manufacturers  said Mr  Huang  They have faced many difficulties   he said   Therefore  this time the focus of tax reduction is on small and micro enterprises and manufacturing enterprises  
WASHINGTON   The Air Force secretary  Heather A  Wilson  said on Friday that she would resign after two years of reining in Trump administration plans for a widely criticized Space Force and overseeing a branch of the military that is involved in lengthy air campaigns over Afghanistan  Iraq and Syria Ms  Wilson  one of the highest ranking women at the Pentagon  had been considered a potential successor to Jim Mattis  who stepped down as defense secretary in December  Instead  she announced in a resignation letter that she would become president at the University of Texas at El Paso  after a vote by the university s Board of Regents She plans to remain at the helm of the Air Force until May 31  allowing time for a  smooth transition   she wrote in the resignation letter  which was first reported by Reuters  American higher education needs strong leaders to meet the challenges of the 21st century   she wrote   It has been a privilege to serve alongside our airmen over the last two years and I am proud of the progress we have made restoring our nation s defense  Her departure clears one hurdle for the elevation of Patrick M  Shanahan  the acting defense secretary  to the Pentagon s top job  Defense Department officials said Ms  Wilson had a tense relationship with Mr  Shanahan  who is unwavering in his vocal support of President Trump   including of plans for a Space Force Several Defense Department officials said that they expected the president to formally nominate Mr  Shanahan as defense secretary  but the president has been known to change his mind Ms  Wilson successfully worked to ensure that a newly created Space Force would be part of the Air Force instead of becoming a separate military branch  as Trump administration officials had initially planned  She also argued that creating the Space Force would be expensive and build a new bureaucracy that would risk slowing space development  just as the United States confronts fresh challenges in the field Mr  Shanahan had helped push a Space Force independent of the Air Force Additionally  in September  Ms  Wilson announced the Air Force s aim to increase its number of squadrons to 386 by 2030  from 312  anticipating a great power conflict with Russia and China The pivot to future wars came as Ms  Wilson was already grappling with shortages in readiness   including wear and abuse on the Air Force s fleet of aircraft   for missions in Iraq  Afghanistan and Syria  In October  Mr  Mattis ordered the Air Force to increase mission capable rates for some squadrons  to 80 percent by the end of 2019 from roughly 70 percent A Rhodes Scholar  Ms  Wilson was one of Mr  Trump s first appointees at the Pentagon  for which she left her job as the first female president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology Mr  Trump said that Ms  Wilson  has done an absolutely fantastic job  and congratulated her selection as president of the El Paso campus at the University of Texas  which he said was effective Sept  1 
The Democratic National Committee s decision to bar Fox News from hosting a 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate will undoubtedly  and understandably  prove to be a popular decision with the party s core  primarily coastal base But it s also very shortsighted and could hurt the party and its candidates  In the minds of many progressive Democrats  Fox News may be synonymous with Sean Hannity  But in the minds of many other Americans  Fox News is synonymous with what they put on to watch Bret Baier  Shepard Smith or Chris Wallace These Fox News anchors and personalities do not do the bidding of the Trump administration   go find Mr  Wallace s recent grilling of the Trump anti immigration White House policy adviser Stephen Miller if you re unsure  It s not a given that their viewers are entirely die hard Trump fans  or even Republicans  Fox News   the actual news part   is indeed consumed by some Democrats and independents  And its viewership numbers are big enough that the D N C  is  in its way  cutting off its nose to spite its face by leaving those potential voters on the table and unspoken to According to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey  3 percent of 2016 Hillary Clinton voters cited Fox as their principal news source  exactly one percentage point behind the number who cited NBC and two points behind those who cited The New York Times as the  main source  of their news  Critically  Pew asked its question about  main sources  in an open ended way  they were not pushing anyone to reply  Fox News  Pew data from 2014 shows similar trends  5 percent of people who called themselves  mostly liberal  cited Fox News as their  main source  of news about government and politics  the same number as cited MSNBC   So did 8 percent of those with  mixed  political views  MSNBC didn t rate with them at all  According to New York Times reporting from 2012  a quarter of  Fox and Friends  viewers were Democrats or Democratic leaners  9 percent were independents It s possible that in the era of Trump  those numbers have shifted a lot  It s also possible that every Democrat or independent who watches Fox is a  hate viewer  or views it on mute just to see super telegenic anchors smiling and looking friendly But it s more likely given that Fox has been the most watched cable network for 17 years straight  some people who tune in are people Democrats actually want and need to vote for their candidates  That will be especially the case if the economy starts to sour   February s job numbers offer a hint of that   and voters who were previously more favorable to Mr  Trump start to turn on him  That could easily happen in places where Fox is most likely consumed more by Democrats and independents   like Iowa  the first caucus state  where many farmers are reeling from the effect of Mr  Trump s tariffs and where  in a packed primary field  10 votes here or 10 votes there might make the difference between who emerges as a real contender for the nomination and who is culled straight out of the gate This was presumably the logic behind Senator Kirsten Gillibrand s decision to sit down for an interview with Mr  Wallace last month  Some Democrats criticized her for it  but according to a Washington Post media reporter  over two million people tuned in  Compare that with CNN s town halls with Senator Bernie Sanders  1 35 million viewers   Senator Kamala Harris  1 95 million   Senator Amy Klobuchar  1 15 million  and Howard Schultz  1 02 million   Ms  Gillibrand may be on to something here  even if the Democratic Party as a whole is not  As a Republican who watches CNN and does not plan to vote in Virginia s Democratic primary next year  I d say Ms  Gillibrand probably is  I bet the conservative commentator and talk radio host Erick Erickson  who  prefers  CNN to Fox but has pledged to vote for Mr  Trump  agrees Apart from those numbers and facts  there s another reason Democrats shouldn t bar Fox News from hosting a debate  Ever heard the old political saying that you should never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel  It s actually true  Diving into the  media bias  trough and attacking actual news organizations   and Fox News is one  as demonstrated by a roster of reporters that includes John Roberts and Ed Henry   is the last refuge of losing political organizations and candidates who will not triumph on the day  It s an easy  base hit  that gins up existing supporters and makes them extra motivated by feeling hard done by media elites In some cases  it may even be 100 percent true  But think about it historically  Virtually every time you see a candidate or political group respond by explicitly screaming  media bias   they end up losing the election they are fighting to win or whatever battle they find themselves in  It happened in 2008  it happened in 2012  and it happened in 2016 The D N C  people do not want to play that game  even if short term they think it s good for getting people who otherwise could not give a monkey s uncle about the committee to pony up more  5 and  10 donations   It probably will be  and very likely that s a lot of what this is about   Smart political campaigns are about looking ahead to where things will most likely stand and what votes will be needed on Election Day   or the beginning of early voting   and not responding to whatever the drama of the day or the week is  Democrats hate Fox  and the pressure not to lend them credibility or  punish  it by allowing it to host a debate is immense  But giving into it is ultimately more likely than not to prove shortsighted and pointless  The  no Fox debate  rabble rousers will vote Democratic anyway  those Democrats and independents watching Fox might not  Suck it up and do the debate  It s the smarter move strategically more on fox newsOpinion   Bret Stephens  What Have the Elites Ever Done for Fox Jan  4  2019Liz Mair  who was a strategist for campaigns by Scott

President Trump claimed last June to have ended the practice of separating immigrant families at the southern border   We are going to keep the families together   he declared from the Oval Office Mr  President  meet Clemente and his daughter Wendy  both fleeing gang violence in Guatemala  Your administration separated them six months ago and kept them apart These family separations  continuing but at a lower level than before  are an element of the real  emergency  at the border   the one also involving physical and sexual abuse of immigrant children in U S  custody and systematic deception from Washington The paradox is that Trump s cruel policy to deter desperate immigrants appears counterproductive  apparently the furor it provoked drew attention to the possibility of migration  The result is a surge of Central American families traveling to the United States  with the number crossing the border far higher than a year earlier  Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the

Guatemalan village  He doesn t want to use his last name because of all he has been through at the hands of the U S  government  There is no way to verify parts of his story  but individuals who work with immigrants say it rings true A gang in Guatemala murdered his cousin  and last year gangsters stabbed Clemente s father and sent warnings to Clemente   It s now your turn  Terrified  Clemente fled with his eldest daughter  Wendy  then 15  leaving his wife and five other  younger children  whom he did not believe the gang would target  He feared that the gang would abduct Wendy  an

Clemente at the bus station   I gave him a hug and he started saying he can t find his daughter  he doesn t know where his daughter is  Eventually  Clemente discovered that she was in a shelter  She was allowed to telephone him once a week  but not return to his care  his voice broke as he described her as  an angel from God  Immigration is a complicated challenge  but ripping families apart isn t the solution  Perhaps the best approach is to help improve security in Central America so that people like Clemente need not flee  Some anti gang initiatives there have been very successful in reducing murder rates that drive migration  If it were peaceful  I d like to be back there where I grew up   said Clemente  who received help from Immigrant Families Together in his quest to reunite with his daughter   I d love to be in the land where I was born  The Texas Civil Rights Project found that at least 272 adults were separated from a child family member in the six months after Trump supposedly ended family separation  The youngest to be separated was an 8 month old girl taken from her mother READ MORE ABOUT THE CRISIS AT THE BORDERU S  Continues to Separate Migrant Families

WASHINGTON   Judge T S  Ellis III offered some pointed advice for those who expected him to throw the book at President Trump s former campaign chairman  Paul Manafort  for perpetrating a decade long  multimillion dollar fraud scheme  Go and spend a day in the jail or penitentiary of the federal government   Judge Ellis said on Thursday night from the bench in the United States District Court in Alexandria  Va   Spend a week there  He has to spend 47 months  Judge Ellis dismissed as  vindictive  and  way out of whack  sentencing guidelines that recommended a prison term of 19 to 24 years for Mr  Manafort  69 But to more than a few legal experts  it was Judge Ellis s sentence that was out of whack  They cited it as a glaring example of the leniency that wealthy white collar criminals often receive because they have the money to defend themselves or because judges find it easier to empathize with them  There are a lot of defendants who are going to prison for a lot longer for offenses that are far less serious   said Duncan Levin  a former federal prosecutor who specialized in financial crimes   This sentence is leaving me and a lot of people who do this every day scratching our heads  By some calculations  with credit for the nine months he has already spent in jail  plus a break included in a sentencing law just approved by Congress  Mr  Manafort could serve out Judge Ellis s sentence in just 22 months The judge had predicted some pushback  but he may not have expected how his decision reverberated around the nation  provoking a social media firestorm that swept up public defenders  prosecutors and ordinary citizens  William N  Nettles  a former United States attorney in South Carolina  called Judge Ellis s decision  sentencing disparity on steroids   How in the world can we make sense of the sentences that we have been handing down to the poor and to those people of color who didn t have nearly the opportunities that Paul Manafort had to make an honest living   asked Mr  Nettles  who was an Obama administration appointee Scott Hechinger  a public defender in Brooklyn and a pithy presence on criminal justice on Twitter  made a similar point   For context on Manafort s 47 months in prison  my client yesterday was offered 36 72 months in prison for stealing  100 worth of quarters from a residential laundry room   he wrote Many legal experts criticize sentencing guidelines as unduly punitive  But in four out of five criminal cases  sentences fall within or above the guideline range  unless the government specifically requests a lighter punishment  In Mr  Manafort s case  prosecutors recommended no specific punishment  but said the range of 19 to 24 years had been rightly calculated Rachel E  Barkow  a former member of the United States Sentencing Commission  said she had expected Mr  Manafort s punishment to fall below the guidelines  In fraud cases  the recommended penalty can skyrocket depending on the amount of money involved  she said  leading many judges to opt for a lighter sentence ImageMr  Manafort s lawyers played on Judge Ellis s distaste for special counsels  insisting that their client had been unfairly pursued by prosecutors CreditErik S Lesser EPA  via ShutterstockBut Judge Ellis cut the punishment far more drastically than she expected  said Ms  Barkow  a law professor at New York University Judge Ellis said the guidelines for Mr  Manafort s crimes were distorted by a 2017 decision by the Justice Department that increased the recommended punishment for failing to disclose a foreign bank account  which was one of eight counts Mr  Manafort was convicted of after a lengthy jury trial in his courtroom  He also noted that he had sentenced another defendant who had hidden  200 million in overseas accounts and evaded  18 million in taxes to only seven months in prison  plus restitution Greg D  Andres  the lead prosecutor on the case  argued that Mr  Manafort was different because the jury had found him guilty not only of hiding his wealth and evading  6 million in taxes  but also of deceiving banks to obtain millions of dollars in loans  The two bank fraud counts were the most serious charges he was convicted of  each carrying a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison Mr  Andres also urged Judge Ellis to take the broader picture of Mr  Manafort s behavior into account  including the crimes he admitted to as part of his plea agreement in a related case in Washington  Mr  Manafort acknowledged he was guilty of 10 other felonies on which the Virginia jury had deadlocked 11 to 1  including several more counts of bank fraud But Judge Ellis seemed to see Mr  Manafort s case as more strictly about tax evasion  He noted that one fraudulent loan application was never actually approved  and questioned whether Mr  Manafort had in fact intended to cause that bank a loss when he lied to get another loan   I don t know that there s any other way to defraud a bank and not intend it to lose the money   Mr  Andres replied Carl Tobias  a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law  said Judge Ellis s sentence seemed strangely light  especially given that the judge denied every objection raised by Mr  Manafort s lawyers to the sentencing guidelines   He refuted all of the arguments of the defense  yet ultimately ruled very much in favor of their client   Mr  Tobias said He was also struck  he said  by the judge s praise of Mr  Manafort s character   He s lived an otherwise blameless life   Judge Ellis said of a man who acknowledged orchestrating a sophisticated financial fraud scheme that lasted a decade   And he s also earned the admiration of a number of people  To the very end  Judge Ellis showed his distaste for special counsels  He said the office of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  had the authority to prosecute Mr  Manafort  but  that doesn t mean that I decided the wisdom or appropriateness of delegating to special prosecutors broad powers   Judge Ellis cut off a prosecutor as he tried to explain the special counsel s position on the appropriate fine for Mr  Manafort  admonishing   That s the government s position  I don t want to hear special counsel  The defense has played on the judge s sentiments  insisting that Mr  Manafort has been relentlessly pursued for garden variety crimes only because of his importance to the special counsel s inquiry into Russian interference in 2016 presidential election  On Thursday  Kevin Downing  Mr  Manafort s lead lawyer  took up that refrain again  repeatedly saying that a local United States attorney s office would have handled the case differently In federal court in Washington  where Judge Amy Berman Jackson will sentence Mr  Manafort next week on two conspiracy charges  that strategy has been noticeably less effective Some legal experts suggested that Mr  Mueller s team might respond to Judge Ellis s decision by asking Judge Jackson for a specific sentence on the two conspiracy charges  which each carry a maximum penalty of five years But few expect her to be influenced by the Virginia judge s decision   It s not her job to use her sentence as a moment to correct what she thinks went wrong in this case   Ms  Barkow said One of the biggest issues remaining for Mr  Manafort is whether he will be allowed to serve out his two sentences simultaneously  Prosecutors have taken no stand on that so far  but indicated in a sentencing memorandum that they might do so after Judge Ellis s decision

of the guest having to tell the entire story him  or herself  I could listen to Wesley talk all day  but it s a lot to ask him to deliver every detail of a complex tale  Tape is the ultimate

WASHINGTON   The House will vote on Friday on the Democrats  signature piece of legislation  a sprawling compendium of ballot access  campaign finance transparency and anti corruption proposals devised to restore public trust in government The sweeping measure   as much a campaign platform as an actual piece of legislation   is intended to show the voters who catapulted Democrats into the majority that they are following through on their campaign pledges  The bill  nearly 700 pages  aims to dismantle barriers to voting  end big money in politics and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials  This is about instilling the confidence of the American people in the political process  in what happens in government  that it is the people s interests that are being served   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said But Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill   called the For the People Act or H R  1  to underscore its primacy   and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  has branded it the  Democrat Politician Protection Act  in weekly speeches  The House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  produced his own video to define the bill  This is a terrible proposal   Mr  McConnell said on Wednesday   This is a solution in search of a problem  What it really is is a bill designed to make it more likely that Democrats win more often  Democrats are standing by their legislative handiwork  Now they have to sell it  It s going to become  I believe  a marker of what the Democratic brand is   Representative John Sarbanes  Democrat of Maryland and the lead sponsor of the legislation  said in an interview   We stand for reform  we stand for democracy  we stand for cleaning up our politics  ImageSenator Mitch McConnell  the majority leader  has called the proposal  terrible  and  a solution in search of a problem  CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesSo what is in H R  1 Campaign finance transparencySome of the most debated provisions are intended to disclose who is paying for online political ads and financing so called dark money groups  The Disclose Act  part of the bill  would require super PACs and nonprofit organizations that spend money in elections to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than  10 000  Democrats say such disclosure is broadly popular with voters in both parties  Congress cannot meaningfully address the nation s significant challenges without first recognizing and acknowledging the undue influence of special interests in our politics   said Representative Abigail Spanberger  Democrat of Virginia Some of those provisions  however  have drawn criticism from both conservative and liberal groups that argue the language is overly broad and would infringe on First Amendment rights Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana  the minority whip  said the legislation would turn the Federal Election Commission  into a  speech czar  with the power to enforce Democrats  vague definition of  campaign related speech    The American Civil Liberties Union has urged members to oppose the legislation  Communications that refer to a candidate in the context of an important public policy issue may have nothing to do with supporting or opposing that candidate s election  and yet that speech would trigger disclosure   the organization said in a 13 page letter laying out its concerns The legislation would establish a six to one matching system for donations of up to  200 to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high dollar contributions  That system would be funded by an additional fine on corporations found to have broken the law  Republicans call that welfare for politicians  Make no bones about it  No matter how they try to move a shell game around  the cost will be borne as another mandatory spending program in Washington   said Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois  the ranking Republican on the House Administration Committee Eliminating barriers to votingThe legislation seeks to make it easier to vote  It would designate Election Day as a federal employment holiday and automatically register citizens to vote  restore voting rights to those who have served felony sentences and encourage same day voter registration ImageVoters in Franklin County  Ohio  last year  The legislation aims to prohibit voter roll purges like those that have been challenged in Ohio and Texas CreditJohn Minchillo Associated PressIt also would prohibit voter roll purges  a technique employed by states to prune outdated registrations but one that voting rights advocates say has been used to disenfranchise eligible voters  especially minorities  Such purges have been subjected to court challenges in Ohio and Texas  Voting is crucial  and I don t give a damn how you think about it   Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  said in a fiery hearing on the legislation   I want to be clear  that when they look back on this moment 200 years from now  there are those of us who stood up and said   We will defend the right to vote   Republicans have expressed concern about allowing felons to vote  although in most states  felons can regain their voting rights after they are released  as in Massachusetts and Hawaii   after they complete their parole  as in Colorado and Connecticut  or when they are no longer on parole or probation  as in New Jersey and Texas   Not only is this dangerous  it s unconstitutional   Mr  McCarthy said in his video attacking the legislation Mr  McConnell threw cold water on the proposal to make Election Day a federal holiday  What affects turnout more than anything else is interest and competition   he said   We got a lot of federal holidays in America  I personally don t see any point in having more  Holding the president and other officials accountableThe legislation also provides House Democrats with another opportunity to jab at President Trump with a series of ethics law changes that cut to the heart of some of the controversies bedeviling Mr  Trump It would require presidents and vice presidents  as well as candidates for the nation s highest offices  to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns   Mr  Trump has released none   and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures  Mr  Trump s inaugural committee  which raised a record  107 million and spent lavishly  is  being investigated by prosecutors in New York Asked whether he would support the measure that requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns  Mr  McConnell remained impassive   We ll be happy to look at it  
Immigrant rights advocates and organizers protesting the Trump administration s policies celebrated a victory this week after JPMorgan Chase   Company said it would no longer finance private operators of prisons and detention centers As the administration has stepped up efforts to detain undocumented migrants  privately run prisons have become the government s default detention centers for them  despite reports questioning the facilities  safety  In addition to securing lucrative government contracts  these private companies have also borrowed money from large banks A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase   Company  Andrew Gray  said on Tuesday the company had  a robust and well established process to evaluate the sectors that we serve   As part of this process   he said   we will no longer bank the private prison industry  Mr  Gray did not immediately respond to a question about whether the decision was related to public pressure Last year  two of the country s largest private prison companies  CoreCivic and GEO Group  borrowed about  1 8 billion from several banks  including JPMorgan Chase  Matthew Toole  deals intelligence director at Refinitiv  said on Wednesday  Prison finance represents a small portion of the bank s overall business  according to Reuters While facilities operated by private companies house about 9 percent of the country s prison population  they hold about three quarters of immigrant detainees Ana Maria Archila is the co executive director for the Center for Popular Democracy  a national network of community organizations and individuals that has organized public protests at the bank s headquarters  at annual meetings and outside the bank s chief executive s home in Manhattan In an interview on Tuesday  she said the bank became a focus for its role in profiting from  the caging of humans   which she described as a  morally bankrupt act   I am reminded that when we dare to protest  even when it seems impossible  that we actually lift up the veil on things that were not visible   said Ms  Archila Ms  Archila said the protests had been part of a broader effort by activists to call out corporate entities who they see as  legitimizing  the Trump administration s policies  including the aggressive enforcement of immigration policies and the forcible separation of immigrant children from their parents at the border ImageA CoreCivic facility in Phoenix in 2018 CreditGabriella Angotti Jones The New York TimesWhile testifying to Congress on Wednesday  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  was defiant in the face of criticism over the department s treatment of migrant families at the border  especially over the separation of children from their parents  Ms  Nielsen also encouraged lawmakers to pass legislation that would allow the indefinite detention of families and to more easily turn back claims of asylum by migrants from Central America Representatives for the prison companies expressed frustration with JPMorgan Chase s decision and what they saw as a weaponization of political will  JP Morgan has served an important role in creating better conditions for inmates entrusted in our care   Rodney E  King  a spokesman for CoreCivic  said on Tuesday Mr  King added that the company s immigration facilities did not provide housing for children who weren t under the supervision of a parent  These divestment efforts are politically motivated and based on a deliberate mischaracterization of our role as a long standing service provider to the government   he said Emily Covington  a spokeswoman for the GEO Group  which operates dozens of about 130 dozens of correctional  detention and community re entry sites in the United States  said Tuesday that the company had never managed facilities that house unaccompanied minors  including those who may have been separated from their parents Several activists and politicians embraced the news  including New York City s comptroller  Scott M  Stringer  who called the development  huge  On Valentine s Day this year  an immigrants rights group  Make the Road New York  sent a mariachi band and protesters with  Break Up With Prisons  signs to the townhouse of JPMorgan Chase   Company s chief executive  Jamie Dimon  If we come together and are diligent   Javier H  Valdés  the group s co executive director  said Tuesday  to  build strong coalitions and work with powerful allies  we can actually win and help shift the narrative of enforcement in this country  Ms  Archila  one of several protesters arrested on charges of blocking the entrance to the bank s headquarters in Manhattan in May 2017  said targeting the financial services industry was a new frontier in the campaign for immigrants  rights  In some ways  the Trump era is one of fighting against incredible odds  to protect our communities  to protect ourselves  to protect each other   she said 
Sarah Isgur Flores  a Republican political operative whose hiring by CNN last month set off an uproar among liberals and several Democratic presidential campaigns  will no longer take on a management role at the network  CNN said on Friday Instead  Ms  Isgur  who was the chief spokeswoman for former Attorney General Jeff Sessions  said she would be an on air political analyst for CNN  a more traditional entry level role for government officials who pursue television careers  She will also occasionally write commentary for the network s website When Ms  Isgur s position   initially described as a  political editor   with a role in coordinating CNN s 2020 campaign coverage   was announced three weeks ago  it set off confusion and frustration inside the cable network and Democratic political circles Several journalists at CNN voiced concerns about the hire  They questioned how a partisan spokeswoman and recent alumna of President Trump s administration  who had stayed on at the Justice Department after Mr  Sessions s departure in November  could be granted a senior journalistic role at the network And representatives of several presidential candidates contacted the Democratic National Committee to ask if CNN  with Ms  Isgur in a senior editing position  could be trusted to cover their campaigns fairly  CNN is set to host a Democratic primary debate in July  the network eventually issued statements saying that Ms  Isgur would not play a role in debates or candidate town halls Ms  Isgur  whose contract at the network goes into effect next week  announced her new position in a Twitter post on Friday   I will go to CNN as a Political Analyst instead   she wrote   Will start next month on air and on line  See y all soon  Reached by email  Ms  Isgur declined to comment further  When Sarah came to us and proposed her role be adjusted to a political analyst instead  we agreed  and we look forward to her starting in that role   a CNN spokeswoman said in a statement CNN has hired reporters from conservative leaning news outlets and organizations  saying that ideological diversity can be a boon to well rounded coverage It is unusual  however  for news networks to place a former government official directly into a role managing other journalists  For instance  George Stephanopoulos  who is now the chief anchor of ABC News  was hired by the network as a partisan member of a Sunday political panel after he left President Bill Clinton s staff in 1996 Ms  Isgur was critical of CNN while working on Republican campaigns  including in 2015  when she complained that the network had excluded her candidate at the time  Carly Fiorina  from participating in a presidential debate  She also attacked one of Ms  Fiorina s rivals for the Republican nomination  Donald J  Trump

the Trump campaign s hands  And former Gov  John Hickenlooper of Colorado opened his presidential campaign this week by questioning whether  Medicare for all  was  really the right thing  Welcome to the revenge of the moderates Since President Trump s election  an activist liberal wing has taken hold of the Democratic Party  They ve pushed bold economic  health care and environmental proposals

Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in Congress to Senator Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail But now  as the 2020 primary field comes into sharper focus  we re starting to see a resurgence of

OmarImageCreditMandel Ngan Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesWe ve written before about the brand of zero tolerance racial and gender politics Democrats have embraced in the Trump era  What s happening on Capitol Hill this week with Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota offers perhaps the most high profile test yet of that policy   and how it interacts with the Democrats  new power in Washington For those who haven t been following the issue  here s a quick catch up  Last week  Ms  Omar suggested that pro Israel activists were pushing  for allegiance to a foreign country    a comment that leading Jewish lawmakers said played into the anti Semitic trope of  dual loyalty   They pressured Speaker Nancy Pelosi to introduce a resolution condemning anti Semitism That infuriated a group of younger liberal and minority members  who saw the resolution as unfairly targeting a lawmaker who is not only one of the first Muslim American women in Congress but also a refugee The conflict boiled over in a closed door meeting of House Democrats on Wednesday  What about condemning Islamophobia  demanded the liberal members  What about racism  Homophobia Senators Elizabeth Warren  Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris defended Ms  Omar from the campaign trail  Representative Ayanna Pressley  a freshman Democrat from Massachusetts  said   We need to denounce all forms of hate  There is no hierarchy of hurt  The messy dispute has dominated Congress for the past week  overshadowing a signature Democratic bill  H R  1  designed to send a message about overhauling ethics  lobbying and voting laws  It has also been a boon for Republicans  who have already begun using Ms  Omar as both a symbol of Democratic hypocrisy and a way to give cover for the race baiting  misogynistic remarks of President Trump In an effort to end the uproar  the House today approved a resolution on the oh so bold position of condemning all hate  One Democratic lawmaker told me this week that they just wanted to take the vote and move on as quickly as possible It s not likely to be that easy  Issues of race  gender and immigration dominate our national conversation  Hard to imagine Democrats

Good Thursday morning   Was this email forwarded to you  Sign up here  Big questions over Facebook s privacy pivotFacebook plans to start shifting people toward private messaging and away from the public broadcasting on which its business has been built  Mike Isaac of the NYT reports   Mark Zuckerberg said yesterday that the company  would focus on private and encrypted communications  in which users message mostly smaller groups of people they know     Unlike publicly shared posts that are kept as users  permanent records  the communications could also be deleted after a certain period of time     He said Facebook would achieve the shift partly by integrating Instagram  WhatsApp and Messenger so that users worldwide could easily message one another across the networks    That  Mr  Zuckerberg said  would make Facebook a  living room   rather than a  town square  Facebook s declining public perception  fueled by fake news and data privacy scandals  is driving the shift   Frankly we don t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services   Mr  Zuckerberg said  To grow  and roll out new technologies like its reported cryptocurrency  the company needs to regain trust But plenty of questions remain   What s the business model  Most of the company s current profits come from openly sharing content and displaying targeted ads  which doesn t fit with the privacy push  Mr  Zuckerberg argued that there were  all kinds of different commerce opportunities  available in a shift to privacy  but didn t elaborate   Should its platforms be integrated  It s not clear that users want Instagram  WhatsApp and Messenger to be combined  And Facebook could find itself facing allegations of anti competitive behavior by tying them together   When will it happen  Mr  Zuckerberg had promised to improve Facebook s privacy in the past and then was painfully slow to act   A  Clear History  tool announced last year still hasn t arrived

Constitutional violationsHuawei sued the U S  government yesterday over a ban on government agencies using the Chinese telecom giant s products because they could violate American national security The U S  says Huawei products are a security threat  and could be used by Chinese authorities to spy on telecom networks   though it has yet to produce supporting evidence  Washington has pushed wireless carriers to avoid using the company s equipment  and urged other countries to follow suit The lawsuit will force Washington to show its hand   The U S  Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products   Guo Ping  Huawei s rotating chairman  said in a statement Huawei also claims it s being unfairly singled out in an unconstitutional bill of attainder   where legislation singles out a person or entity for punishment without trial  Mr  Guo said that Congress was acting as  judge  jury and executioner  But the strategy is risky  Its business practices and relationship with Beijing will be put under the microscope  And legal experts say the lawsuit on its own is unlikely to succeed  The Russian cybersecurity

non bank firms will also get an easier ride  A federal oversight panel will scrap the  systemically important financial institution  designation  which subjects non bank firms like insurers and asset managers to intrusive oversight   It s largely symbolic  Only four firms had been labeled systemically important and all have successfully argued to shed that status  This is part of the Trump administration s effort to relax financial regulations imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis  Officials have sided with the banking industry in arguing that Obama era rules stifled lenders  ability to make loans and continue to grow But critics say it s risky  and could lead to a less safe  less transparent financial system  Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets  a financial industry watchdog  told the NYT   The markets are not going to have the full picture  America s trade deficit breaks a recordPresident Trump s aggressive fights over trade are driven by a desire to narrow America s trade deficit  which he sees as a sign of partners taking advantage of the U S  But the gap between imports and exports has actually widened  leaving the U S  with a record trade deficit of  891 3 billion  Jim Tankersley and Ana Swanson of the NYT write    The increase was driven by some factors outside Mr  Trump s control  like a global economic slowdown and the relative strength of the United States dollar  both of which weakened overseas demand for American goods     But the widening gap was also exacerbated by Mr  Trump s  1 5 trillion tax cut   they add   and the trade war he escalated last year     Economists have long warned that Mr  Trump s tax cuts would ultimately exacerbate a trade deficit he has vowed to reduce  as Americans  flush with extra cash  bought more imported goods     By his own metric  the president is failing to right America s global trading relationships  But economists aren t panicking   I d rather live in a country that capital is trying to get into  rather than get out of   Larry Summers  who led the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama  told the NYT   The reason we have a trade deficit is people are investing in America  The E U  wants new Brexit ideas  fastOfficials in Brussels have reportedly asked Prime Minister Theresa May to offer new proposals that would convince British lawmakers to back her Brexit deal within the next 48 hours  the BBC reports  E U  officials said they would work nonstop over the weekend if  acceptable  ideas were received by Friday to break the deadlock  over issues tied to the Irish border  which have been the main sticking point  according to the broadcaster But the U K  has said it already put up  reasonable  proposals to satisfy lawmaker s concerns about being tied to E U  rules   That said  Mrs  May has reportedly outlined steps  to develop technology to keep the Irish border open after Brexit  in the event of no deal  Bloomberg reports  Unsurprisingly  the E U  is pessimistic   There s increasing concern on the European side that any concessions the bloc would be prepared to give wouldn t be sufficient to win a majority in the House of Commons   according

credit ratings or high debt loads   poses a risk to the global markets  Sam Fleming of the FT reports   The F S B  will focus on collateralized loan obligations  which are bundles of leveraged loans that are sold off in tranches  The regulator  wants to identify the holders of C L O s around the world and assess the risks that investors could pull money from exposed institutions during a severe downturn   the FT writes   Investors in C L O s include banks  investment funds and insurers   Randy Quarles  the chairman of the F S B   told the FT   From a financial stability risk  point of view  we need to know more about that than we do  and we have set up a process at the F S B  to understand that     Companies have been amassing cheap loans thanks to low interest rates and loosening lending standards  and in the U S  nonfinancial corporate debt is now a higher share of gross domestic product than before the crisis   Mr  Fleming writes ImageHow HBO repeatedly failed to stop

the Editor that helped make sense of  Death of a Salesman   or a Smarter Living piece that  as one student wrote  would have greatly helped Hamlet  handle his anger responsibly  Like last year  when comparisons to the  MeToo movement dominated submissions  the echoes of some of our most pressing issues were everywhere  Students saw parallels to climate change in Plato s  Allegory of the Cave  and Beckett s  Waiting for Godot   but also in a Rachmaninoff concerto and a mathematical problem called the Collatz conjecture  Similarly  the role of apps  social media  Crispr and other technologies in

 A Lack of Respect for the Working Class in America Today   to  Death of a Salesman  CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesAlexa Bolnick  Indian Hills High School  Franklin Lakes  N J    Death of a Salesman  by Arthur Miller and  A Lack of Respect for the Working Class in America Today Last year  reading the play  Death of a Salesman   I couldn t understand why salesman Willy Loman refused to accept his son s desire to perform manual labor for a living  If working on a ranch made him happy  then why couldn t Willy let his son go After reading Daniel Wasik s letter to The New York Times   A Lack of Respect for the Working Class in America Today   I realized that this prejudice against  blue collar  jobs dates back to the beginning of the 20th century  In the 1800s  agriculture dominated the economy  and the average American was a small farmer  However  the Industrial Revolution and development of corporations introduced a slew of new business related jobs  such as marketing  finance  management  and sales  Since these jobs required much less physical work and offered a steady paycheck  millions seized the opportunity  resulting in urbanization and the domination of business over agriculture  Consequently  the average American was no longer a farmer  but a city dweller  transforming the American dream from the picturesque scene of a quaint farm with a white picket fence to one of wealth and materialistic success Americans seem to have forgotten the fact that only a century ago  we would be living on farms  performing manual labor  So much value was placed on the image of the successful businessman  that we have forgotten about our roots  about the people who form the foundation of our success  Working class Americans comprise one third of the population  yet they are looked down upon and treated with disrespect  The common misconception is that  blue collar  jobs are unfulfilling  for people who lack ambition  However  this belief is due to the selfish and materialistic society in which we live  money is not the only consideration when choosing a career  What one individual finds enticing may seem unrewarding to another  but that doesn t make them less of a person Willy Loman cannot accept that both he and his son would be happier performing manual labor because he doesn t want to be viewed as less  He cannot understand his son s preference of a simple life because society values material over emotional success Today  there are too many Willy Lomans in the world  too many people who look down on the working class like they lead subpar lives  They fail to consider that someone needs to perform the hands on work that keeps the country running  As the American economy has grown immensely over the last century  working class Americans have experienced little improvement in their quality of life  Yet  as the backbone of our economy  they should be sharing in that growth  Working class Americans deserve better  it is time for them to receive the respect they deserve Alex Iyer  Geneva School of Boerne  San Antonio  Homer s  The Odyssey  and  As Rich Nations Close the Door on Refugees  Uganda Welcomes Them In literature  we learned that in Homer s epic poem  The Odyssey   Homer uses the tribulations of the hero Odysseus to illustrate the Ancient Grecian custom of xenia  This custom focused on extending hospitality to those who found themselves far from home  As Odysseus navigates the treacherous path back to his own home  he encounters both morally upstanding and malevolent individuals  They range from a charitable princess who offers food and clothing  to an evil Cyclops who attempts to murder the hero and his fellow men  In class  we agreed that Homer employs these contrasting characters to exemplify not only proper  but also poor forms of xenia For the people of its time   The Odyssey  cemented the idea that xenia was fundamental for good character  resulting in hospitality becoming engrained in the fabric of Ancient Grecian society  I saw a parallel to this in a New York Times article called  As Rich Nations Close the Door on Refugees  Uganda Welcomes Them  published on October 28  2018  Similar to the prevalent custom of xenia in Ancient Greece  Uganda has made hosting refugees a national policy  The country is now occupied by up to 1 25 million refugees  many of whom are fleeing the violent unrest of South Sudan The xenia of Homeric times implied a mutually beneficial relationship between host and guest  We see this in Uganda  where villagers share land with South Sudanese refugees  Grateful for this generosity  the refugees gladly help out with farming  carpentry  and even translation  Many Ugandans remember when they themselves had to look to Sudan for sanctuary  During the murderous rampages of Idi Amin and Joseph Kony  the Sudanese provided critical support to Ugandan refugees  These memories are motivating modern day Ugandans to assist refugees  bringing the world a little closer to what xenia strived for over 2 000 years ago Uganda and South Sudan are by no means wealthy utopias  However  xenia was never about the rich blindly giving to the poor  It aspired to foster symbiotic relationships of openness and inclusivity that would endure through time  It s interesting that a quaint Greek ideal from thousands of years ago would find a practical application in Uganda  When Amos Chandiga was asked why he lent two acres of his own land to refugees  he simply responded  They asked me  and I gave it to them   He then patted his chest and said  It comes from here  in my heart   Perhaps this can serve as a lesson to Americans  as we grapple with modernizing our own asylum policies  Teaching us that  whether rich or poor  open borders give way to open hearts Megan Lee  West Windsor Plainsboro High School North  Plainsboro  N J    Harrison Bergeron  by Kurt Vonnegut and  The Curse of Affirmative Action From racial justice to gender discrimination  the struggle towards equality is one that holds undeniable weight and value  However  maintaining an equal and just society requires a careful assessment of the ways in which inclusive efforts can be exclusive at the same time In  The Curse of Affirmative Action   author Bret Stephens argues the flaws of a policy that aims to provide equal opportunities to minority groups in education and employment  Stephens makes light of a recent legal battle  Students Against Fair Admissions vs  Harvard  in which qualified Asian American students were being denied chances of admission for unjustifiable reasons in order to create a racial balance  A systematic preference for minority groups through affirmative action has imposed negative effects on another minority group for which the policy was created   although this measure was initiated with the intention of inclusion  it has the ability to do the exact opposite at the same capacity  Stephens states that   The very people who ordinarily championed affirmative action as a cornerstone of a decent society   had no trouble understanding the other dimension of the policy   an unfair preference for the unqualified  They knew that  affirmative action   whatever its benefits as a form of social engineering  was a synonym for mediocrity  Paralleling the same theme  the short story  Harrison Bergeron  by Kurt Vonnegut describes a future in which absolute equality has become the obsession of society  In order to achieve this  any special quality is eliminated through the use of mental and physical handicaps  Those who are intelligent wear earpieces that transmit disruptive noises  those who are beautiful wear degrading masks  and those who are powerful are held down with bags of lead  While doing so allows for a society where no one is above each other  it is also simultaneously counterintuitive and unfair for every citizen  Mediocre standards are set for every characteristic  and the different talents that each individual possesses is buried in the name of total equality Although the  Harrison Bergeron  is a heavily exaggerated piece of fiction writing while  The Curse of Affirmative Action  was written to denounce a real world policy  both allude to the delicacy of equality  Ensuring that every citizen has the same rights  opportunities  and fair treatment regardless of personal characteristics is essential to creating a society of growth  tolerance  and productivity  However  translating these values into policies that embrace a healthy equitable balance is an undeniable challenge  As we continue to progress towards a more equal and inclusive society  we must consider and revise the ideal environment that allows equality to thrive Jeffrey Liao  Livingston High School  Livingston  N J    The Grapes of Wrath  by John Steinbeck and  The Impossible Choice My Father Had to Make Migration  It is a concept fundamental in nature birds fly south every winter in search of cloudless skies  fish swim away from vast ocean depths to spawn in rivers  dragonflies follow the passage of cold fronts in autumn to reach sun soaked shores Yet for humans  the story is more complicated  In her New York Times op ed  The Impossible Choice My Father Had to Make   Reyna Grande illustrates the profound sacrifices that her father and undocumented migrants like him must make in order to provide a better future for their loved ones  Through her account of her father s journey to America  Grande emphasizes the prejudice and violence perpetrated against immigrants from President Trump s policy that separated thousands of children from their parents to the derogatory term  illegal alien  that recently entered the sociopolitical landscape highlighting the unfortunate reality that  in a nation claiming to be built on the ideals of  liberty  and  justice  for all  a deep undercurrent of xenophobia still plagues American society and needs to be addressed John Steinbeck s classic novel  The Grapes of Wrath   which chronicles the struggles of the Joad family during the Great Depression  documents a similar reality  Due to massive dust storms that erode their property and exacerbate their economic troubles  the Joad family moves westward in search of work  When they reach the haunted promised land of California  however  their hope and optimism quickly wither to ash and dust  Beneath the glimmering façade of opportunities that abound in  the land of the free   the brutal living conditions  poverty  and abuse of workers are quickly exposed  The locals derisively refer to the newcomers as  Okies   and  due to rising concerns of a labor uprising  the aristocratic landowners mistreat their migrant workers and promote exploitative policies to keep them subservient and dependent  This vicious cycle of destitution the faithful becoming faithless  the poor becoming penniless illustrates the subjugation of the marginalized and the erasure of those on the fringes of society Although written nearly a century ago   The Grapes of Wrath  documents a social injustice that mirrors the plight of immigrants in contemporary America  As Grande notes in her op ed  the Trump administration s restrictions on those seeking asylum or legal migration exemplifies the frightening ignorance and monoculturalism of our most powerful political leaders  Just as the migrants in Steinbeck s novel grew despondent as police officers jailed union strikers and burned their makeshift camps to the ground  modern immigrants must endure the painful struggles that arise from discrimination fueled by Trump s divisive policies and hateful rhetoric  As Americans  we must do better  We must recognize and speak out against the systemic injustices that immigrants face to preserve the patchwork quilt of diversity that comprises the social fabric of our country Jack Magner  Flint Hill School  Oakton  Va   Biological feedback loops and homeostasis and  After  MeToo  the Ripple Effect All it takes is a single action to spark innumerable reactions  In the case of Jessica Bennett s  After  MeToo  the Ripple Effect   it is the publishing of a 2017 article in the Times that launches a revolution  changing the treatment and recognition of women for the better  In the case of AP Biology  it is the connection of a ligand to a receptor protein or a drastic change to an organism s environment that sends millions of signals that protect the organism from harm In her article  Bennett aptly describes the systemic suppression of women in their attempts to come forward as a form of  machinery   containing several long standing fail safes designed to ensure that vulnerable members of society remain silent  This phenomenon mirrors that of negative feedback loops in biology  in which a stimulus triggers a biological response designed to keep a biological system at equilibrium  Like an increase in body temperature in order to kill a disease  our male centric society has developed instinctual  often subconscious methods to protect powerful men at the expense of women  leaving them powerless to speak up Conversely  however  the  MeToo movement has thrown a wrench in the once impenetrable machinery of patriarchal society  It has extended beyond the limits and implicit biases of the American legal process  providing an open forum for women to share their own experiences  In opposition to a systemic negative feedback loop  women have created a positive feedback loop  where a single stimulus prompts the increase of a specific biological response  which in turn leads to the creation of more stimulus  In this rendition  women bravely tell their stories  Subsequently  women feel less alienated about their own experiences and men begin to consider how their actions affect women  As a result of that response  more women speak up and step forward  causing the process to begin again  Each woman s story serves as a stimulus for a unique  biochemical cascade  of societal impact  with the internet serving as its technological  signal transduction pathway   MeToo and feedback loops are extremely interconnected  but there is one key difference in the  MeToo movement that makes it so dynamic and revolutionary  In biology  feedback responses are developed slowly and organically over millions of years of evolution  Environments select for these responses  and a species s fitness increases as a result  The  MeToo movement is the exact opposite  attacking the perceived natural order that our environment has selected for at the expense the  fittest  members of society  powerful men  This positive feedback loop does not run in concurrence with the already established negative feedback loop  It instead serves as its foil  aiming to topple the destructive systems for which hyper masculine society has selected for over thousands of years Kylie Magnus  Verona Area High School  Verona  Wis    The End of Men  And the Rise of Women  by Hanna Rosin and  How Same Sex Couples Divide Chores  and What It Reveals About Modern Parenting  Marriage still ain t equal  y all  It ain t equal   These words spoken by former First Lady Michelle Obama depict the vast inequalities in what is supposed to be a two sided affair  It takes two to be married  yet women are still being treated like second class citizens in their own homes  While women have made great strides in the workplace  their quest to  have it all  has been hindered by the increasing amount of housework they still shoulder  This inequality for heterosexual marriages is very different from the equity that homosexual couples have found in their own home lives For my AP Language and Composition class  I read  The End of Men  And the Rise of Women   written by journalist Hanna Rosin  She found that most women  even if they earn the most money in their household or if their husband stays at home  do most of the childcare and housework  A software engineer in the book who is the primary breadwinner was quoted saying   I have to do the same house child care work  as a stay at home mom   AND if I lose my job  my whole family is  expletive    54  This book  while providing a comprehensive view of how heterosexual couples interact and carry out housework and child rearing  does not identify that this system works much differently in same sex marriages  The New York Times article  How Same Sex Couples Divide Chores  and What It Reveals About Modern Parenting   written on May 16  2018 by Claire Cain Miller  analyzes how marriages that do not need to worry about which gender traditionally does certain chores divide housework much more evenly  until they have children  In the article  it was established that partners divide chores based on personal preference  After the couple has children  however  they tend to divide housework based on which partner does more work outside the home  Contrary to this  women in opposite sex marriages who work outside the home can shoulder two to three times more housework and childcare than their husbands This new dynamic  introduced primarily once marriage between same sex couples was legalized in 2015  proves that heterosexual couples do not need to follow the traditional gender roles  especially if one partner works more  In order for heterosexual women to gain any freedom from the housework they are so burdened with  these couples should take notes on the tactics homosexual couples are using  By each partner doing an equitable amount of chores and childcare  based on the amount of work they

Times op ed article   Republicans for Democrats   the  Never Trump  movement was galvanized by political moralism  Contemporary conservatives  vehement opposition to Trump resembles Mugwumps  bolt from allegedly corrupt nominee James Blaine to Democrat Grover Cleveland in the 1884 Presidential election  Republican anti Trump attitudes echo those of their nineteenth century counterparts  such as Carl Schulz  who wrote   Our duty to the country is paramount to any duty we may owe to the party  Both groups denounced their party s irredeemable deviation from its fundamental values  Mugwump George William Curtis rejected Blaine on the grounds that his party  formerly representing  political morality and personal liberty   had  sprung from a moral sentiment   The estranged Mugwumps utilized political mobilization to hold the Party to the ideals on which it had been established  Curtis  diagnosis is readopted by contemporary voters like Lynn Schmidt  who  appalled by Trump s incivility  affirmed   I am no longer a Republican if the G O P  is the Party of Trump   Curtis and Schmidt attributed an unfit politician to the Republican Party s departure from ethics  Both movements challenged the integrity of their Party as a means of reformation Mugwumps and Never Trumpers share the desire to preserve honesty in democracy  Mugwumps vocally rejected Blaine  recognizing the regressive effects of embracing an immoral candidate  In 1881  Schulz suggested that Blaine s election would prompt an unprecedented descent of the government  into a depth of demoralization and corruption   By rejecting Blaine  Mugwumps aimed to fulfill a civic duty to maintain governmental virtue  Schulz s alarm is mirrored by Never Trump Republicans like Mary Beth Hunt  who reluctantly supported Democratic candidates on the basis that  under Trump   we are watching the demise of our democracy   Both sentiments identified party switching as a measure to avoid the Republic s plunge into immorality The parallels in the Mugwump and Never Trump movements demonstrate the significance of adhering to a strict moral standard  despite extreme partisan divides  Developing in atmospheres of distinct political polarization   residual disaccord from the Civil War and partisan rifts following the controversial election of Donald Trump   both groups were subjected to scathing criticism from Republican loyalists  Nonetheless  they wielded significant influence  historians attribute Cleveland s victory over Blaine to the pivotal Mugwump presence in New York  and today s political analysts attribute the new majority Democrat House to voters in previously Republican strongholds turning to Democratic candidates  The results of the 2018 midterms show political moralism as a counterweight to party fealty  and modern day mugwumpery in full force Connor Stevens  Sunset High School  Portland  Ore    Fahrenheit 451  by Ray Bradbury and  How Egypt Crowdsources Censorship How can you control ideas  In today s world  you scroll through feeds  finding any information available  government trade deals  local restaurants  movies  and TV shows  We are in an age where the power to find any fact  answer or piece of information that floats into question is available anywhere  If this privilege was stripped by a bodying government  how would freedom of information change The theme of censorship is the template for Ray Bradbury s novel   Fahrenheit 451  where the dystopian society has banned books and firemen burn down houses  Citizens in this society fall into a loop of routine and empty beliefs where they ve been force fed nonsensical information by the government  Bradbury describes the painstaking process Montag makes to find the history of books and through the help of an outside thinker  Clarisse Mcclellan  he rethinks his entire existence as a fireman Though the absurdity of banning books is the basis of the novel  some of the government s restriction on information are apparent today  Specifically  the actions of those in power  In the article headed   How Egypt Crowdsources Censorship  it expresses the government s ban on anything that may contradict the state  its leaders or the religion that is sought out by its very people  Shortly after the impending gas deal between Egypt and Israel  reporters posted an article regarding the government s actions and were immediately instructed to remove the writing from the news site  This intolerance to free speech oppresses the people much like those in Bradbury s novel  Reporter and editor of a weekly Cairo newspaper  Yasmine El Rashidi  said he too  learned to self censor  The approach to self censorship is exactly what Bradbury advises us to avoid  The governance in  Fahrenheit 451  protects their people from offensive information by removing the issue completely while ignoring the casualty of accessible information  Events suspiciously similar to today appear in Bradbury s novel  Montag gets stopped while walking without purpose  Yasmine Rashidi is stopped and questioned by police officers simply for carrying a notebook  These analogous patterns make you wonder  have people lost the right to freedom Both the American and Egyptian countries are built off of the idea of a free democracy and more accurately  a republic  To strip away any information displayed for the public would go against the building blocks of developed society and would neighbor the future characterized by Bradbury  It s obvious to pick out the foolishness of removing the process of self thinking in  Fahrenheit 451   however  today this fiction is seeping its way into existence through the governmental censorship of news reporting If we surrender our right to advantageous knowledge  how can we truly conceive ideas independently Zaria Roller  Verona Area High School  Wis    Things Fall Apart  by Chinua Achebe and  The Boys Are Not All Right Colonial age Nigeria and modern day Western society have more in common than one would think  Although the buzz phrase  toxic masculinity  did not exist at the time Chinua Achebe s  Things Fall Apart  was written  its protagonist  Okonkwo  might as well be the poster boy for it Though the novel focuses primarily on colonization and change  I could not help but think of its theme of masculinity when I read Michael Ian Black s NYT article  The Boys Are Not All Right   In his words  toxic masculinity is responsible for the   brokenness of  America s boys   in the US  men are 3 54 times more likely to commit suicide than women  and 97 4  of mass shootings between 1982 and 2018 were carried out by men Okonkwo fell victim to the unrealistic standards of toxic masculinity throughout Things Fall Apart  he beat his wives  killed a child put under his care  and refused to show affection  all in the name of not appearing weak or effeminate  Ultimately  this behavior caused his tragic fall  He was once considered the greatest warrior alive  by the end of the book  he was reduced to a failure of a man  unable to prevent the Europeans from taking control of his village  This was deeply emasculating for him  as his identity and pride stemmed from his power  and he eventually resorted to hanging himself  Men expressing their emotions and opening up about their struggles was frowned upon then  and still is  something Michael Ian Black aims to change  Okonkwo s struggles  although expressed through a work of fiction  were very real and continue to plague modern society Toxic masculinity squashes men s ability to express themselves  whether that be through emotions  the way they dress  or how they act  Men need not show their abilities through aggression  as Okonkwo believed  other men in his tribe unabashedly proclaimed who they were through music  storytelling  and masquerade ceremonies  And such is the message of Michael Ian Black  affirming to young men that expression and vulnerability are things to be strived towards rather than ashamed of Although it was not Achebe s original intent  I believe he inadvertently makes a case for feminism in  Things Fall Apart  by showing the negative impact of Okonkwo s toxic masculinity  Through the lens of toxic masculinity  the worst thing men can be is like women  crying or spending time on one s appearance is heavily criticized  If gender equality is achieved  there will be no standard for men to be reduced to  We need to take a page out of Michael Ian Black s book and look to feminism to fix the world s broken boys  lest they fall into the deadly cycle that has existed since long before Okonkwo s time Sebastian Zagler  John T  Hoggard High School  Wilmington  N C   the Collatz  or 3n 1  conjecture  a mathematical problem that has produced no mathematical proof for over 80 years  and  Stopping Climate Change Is Hopeless  Let s Do It  The Collatz conjecture is a seemingly simple math problem  It reads   Multiply any counting number by 3 and add 1 when odd  and divide it by 2 when even  and it will eventually reach one   And while this conjecture has been observed to be true  it has never been proven mathematically  Its solution is much more complex than the problem s statement  The same could be said about climate change  Describing the problem is easy  climate change is fueled by an excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  trapping in heat and causing a warming of the planet  However  solving the problem is so much more difficult  As Auden Schendler and Andrew P  Jones write in their article   Stopping Climate Change is Hopeless  Let s do it   reversing climate change will be more difficult than  sending a man to the moon   or even  winning World War II  The Collatz conjecture is famous in the mathematical community  Its apparent simplicity yet monstrous difficulty pulls people in  Experts and laymen alike have tried to solve it and have shared their results for others to continue  The problem has appeared in countless dissertations and journals  Still  it remains unsolved after 82 years  and a discovery of the solution in the near future is highly unlikely  The legendary mathematician Paul Erdos put it simply   Mathematics may not be ready for such problems   It may require the development of new branches and innovations in mathematics to prove the Collatz conjecture Climate change is similar  it may take new branches of science and changes in human behavior to develop the solution  It is a global problem which scientists and politicians must work on together  across nations  sharing their progress amongst each other to continue the fight  It has become apparent that the reversal of climate change is the hardest task that humans have ever faced  so hard that they may never see it realized  It is  not a job with a clear payoff   and yet people devote their lives to it What draws mankind to these impossible problems  whether it be solving the Collatz conjecture or reversing climate change  Fighting for a common cause brings people together  making them part of something greater  Even fighting a  long defeat  can give one a sense of purpose a sense of belonging  There is a beauty in fighting a losing battle  as long as a glimmer of hope remains  And as Schendler and Jones write   If the human species specializes in one thing  it s taking on the

psychology  we learned about a term  choice blindness  Essentially  a person becomes so consumed with their own choice that they fail to see any development or change in the situation that would change their opinion  It s part of a bigger circumstance called the introspection illusion  People tend to be more confident and stubborn than they should be in their choices  we will even go to the extent of defending an argument that s wrong  just because we made it Unfortunately  this is reminiscent of the political climate today  In the article  Why Trump Supporters Don t Mind His Lies  by Daniel A  Efron  it states that Donald Trump made over 2 400 false statements in under 400 days in office  however  his Republican approval ratings are at 82 percent  The excuses people actually believe these falsehoods or they just don t mind them because they re a result of his confidence  nonetheless  I believe it stems from this introspective illusion  Specific to our president  in 2016  voters made a choice and now that that choice may not be as ideal  people still want to believe they were right  This isn t specific to Trump either  In all major issues  there tends to be two sides that get so caught up in their own viewpoint that they refuse to even acknowledge the other side Gabriela Garity  Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart  Miami  Fla   Plato s  Allegory of the Cave  and

deforestation  and pollution have increased  so have global temperatures and natural disasters  Why  in our abundance of knowledge  do those in power turn their backs to the truth  Paul Krugman  author of  Climate Denial Was the Crucible for Trumpism   says the reason is a combination of  corruption  willful ignorance  conspiracy theorizing and intimidation   Examining the relationship between knowledge and politics  Plato in his  Allegory of the Cave  presents a similar list of reasons  lack of sense of duty  private interests  and corrupt political ambition In Plato s allegory  a group of prisoners chained inside a cave  unable to turn their heads to look around  have spent their entire lives believing that the shadows in front of them are  real  objects  One prisoner escapes and enters the world of light  recognizing that his life in the cave lacked objective truth  When he informs the other prisoners of his findings and attempts to liberate them  they threaten to put him

Woolf s  Professions for Women  and  How I Came to Hate the Word  Wife  As bizarre as it may sound to an American reader   aegyo  a Korean word for acting cute   is encouraged in Korean women  Female celebrities are often asked to show aegyo on television  a young female singer named Kang Jiyoung once incurred much hatred online for refusing to show aegyo on a talk show  Aegyo has long become a characteristic many Korean men expect in women  and even many women concede that it is a quality that women should possess Growing up in such a society  I did not ponder the implications of aegyo deeply until I came across Virginia Woolf s  Professions for Women  in my AP English Language class  Delivered in 1931 before a branch of the National Society for Women s Service  the speech celebrates Woolf s successful killing of the Angel in the House  the idea that a woman should be devoted and submissive to her husband   I rejoiced in her success only briefly  however  my eyes lingered over her lament that she still has  many ghosts to fight  many prejudices to overcome   Indeed  the conventionality of men restricts a woman s freedom  A woman can no longer be herself once

Hard Truth  About Science There s a famous line in German  Translated  it goes   As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams  he discovered that he had been changed into a monstrous  verminous bug   It comes from Franz Kafka s most celebrated novel   The Metamorphosis   in which salesman Gregor Samsa wakes up  suddenly transformed into an insect like creature  or bug  or cockroach  or dung beetle  or   we don t really know  Metamorphosing  The Metamorphosis  into English has been a translator s quandary for over a century  The German word Kafka uses in place of  bug  is  Ungeziefer   and yes  it s a capitalized proper noun  with no direct English translation  Translators search their entomological glossaries for suitable  Ungeziefer  alternatives but to no consensus    But the problem of translation doesn t just stick to the literary world  it very much extends into our own lives through science communication  Science and technical journalists are tasked with the same challenge as literary translators  They need to take dense  jargon filled research articles and clarify them into succinct feature pieces that both catch the eye and stay true to scientific findings  Effectively  they just like Kafka s translators must interpret and innovate to get a text from language A  the scientific world  to language B  the general public   And sometimes  compromises must be made for simplicity s sake But between staying true to hard data and embellishing it for readability  or for clicks  is a balancing act  Fake news writers and conspiracy curators

Bradbury s work  Steyerl shares with her audience that technology  divides and fragments  people  just as Bradbury s nursery ultimately separates and destroys the family s relationship Although there

The New York Times also provides anecdotes in  Military Veterans Respond to Our Cover Story About Moral Injury  that describe the psychological injury to veterans  The Things They Carried  is a succinct compilation of stories and experiences about the Vietnam War  They range in both length and drama  but each reveals something about the realities of Vietnam  He recounts how a friend was

response  he claims  The victim was a young Vietnamese man walking along a path adjacent to the American ambush team  However  the most important aspect of this story is how O Brien presents several

a step away from the utter chaos of it all  With the clamor of so many voices  each scrambling to be heard over the other  how can we hope to hear our own Stronger importance has been placed on the  self  as of late  and with that importance comes the need for self expression  There needs to be a way to make ourselves heard not just to an audience  but to ourselves  Terry Tempest Williams  in  Why I Write   explains how her writing does just that  Our class had first read it in order to pinpoint exactly why we  as individuals  chose to write  At first glance  the poetry of it struck a chord with me  In it  I saw a piece of myself  We went around  articulating our own purposes for writing  and I was surprised to find that many of us had similar reasoning   to explain   to express   to understand the world around  ourselves    Williams  too    writes  to make peace with the things  she  cannot control   These similarities couldn t be a coincidence The act of creating for yourself  and yourself alone  transports you from the turmoil of the world and creates a space where you can be alone with your thoughts  It can be  an act of slowness   allowing you to process the constant flood of information from behind screens  Or  as Tammy Kim writes in  The Feminist Power of Embroidery   it can be  transgressive in its silence and domesticity  Kim expresses a similar sentiment to Willams  in  The Feminist Power of Embroidery   admitting that while  resistance is necessarily public   there is a corresponding need for time indoors  where  she  can be still and let the mind

Paul Bledsoe displays society s lack of action over the past 30 years  from the meager response to the staggering climate reports of the 1980s to the current withdrawal of the US from the Paris Climate Accords  ending his article with another warning about the rapid warming of the planet and the costs to humanity in the near and far future  Like we care Although tempting  to think this increasing disregard of our global problems is merely a modern phenomenon would truly be naive  Societal ignorance is a never ceasing historical habit  which has spread into our literature through the escapist genre  often infused with political allegory In my English class  we recently read the play  Waiting for Godot  by Samuel Beckett  a play originally written in France in 1949  The play follows two characters  Vladimir and Estragon  as they wait for a man named Godot for reasons unknown to the reader  As Vladimir and Estragon wait for Godot  they converse about things they wish to do  hang themselves from a nearby tree  never see each other again  and move from where they are  ultimately ceasing to wait for Godot  However  Vladimir and Estragon severely lack the motivation to take almost any action throughout the play  expressed ironically at the end of Act I when Beckett writes ESTRAGON  Well  shall we go VLADIMIR  Yes  let s go They do not move  Curtain    Beckett s incessant displays of inaction are not only purposeful  but also a satirical stab at the ignorance of the political elite in post WWII France  Although his play was written for another time  Beckett s Waiting

peers and I just went through the motions  did the homework and took the tests  Only after reading about the Uighur Muslims did I understand why we were being taught the same unit year after year Valerie Wang and Kisha Yan  Richard Montgomery High School  Bethesda  Md   Newton s Third Law and  Women Will Pay for the Mess of the Kavanaugh Confirmation Newton published his laws of motion in his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy  Not only have these laws been the cornerstones of the field of physics  but they re also applicable to the metaphysical world  Perhaps the most often quoted is Newton s third law  which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction  Simply put  it explains why your knuckles hurt while boxing  or why a tennis ball bounces  Outside of its implications in a classroom setting and its fundamental interpretations  the general principle stands  everything you do will have repercussions  making it crucial to remain tenacious in our words and actions For decades  people have been urged to speak up about sexual assault  yet society still tiptoes around the subject like it is broken glass  The past year has brought momentous change  with pivotal figures such as Christine Blasey Ford  Deborah Ramirez  and Julie Swetnick shedding much needed light on the issue of sexual harassment  Women around the world  realizing that they were not alone  were empowered by the courage of others to share their own stories  sometimes earning justice for the crimes committed against them  Although the rise in such testimonials should have solely been constructive in the treatment of women in society  it has caused unanticipated backlash and damage The article headline   Women Will Pay for the Mess of the Kavanaugh Confirmation   likely shocked readers initially  especially those for whom Ford has become a beacon of inspiration  Yet  reading into the article reveals the author s disheartening  albeit true  conclusion that the women involved  the very people who ought to have benefitted from Ford s testimony  are unfortunately losing just as much as they should have gained  Hence  being equal  but opposite Maxwell T  Wilson

and personality  find themselves in a relationship built not on love but on carnal needs  violence  dominance  and submission  One is delicate  valuing kindness and virtue  The other is aggressive  even animalistic  It works because the former submits to the latter  rationalizing and forgiving abusive behavior American literature buffs might recognize this relationship as that of Tennessee Williams  Stanley and Stella Kowalski  two main characters in  A Streetcar Named Desire   But the pattern of dysfunction also describes another star crossed couple  The United States and China A recent article in The New York Times entitled  China Is a Dangerous Rival  and America Should Treat It Like One  noted that the Chinese are simultaneously one of our greatest trading partners  and one of our greatest strategic enemies  Their ideology is antithetical to ours  they steal our intellectual property and rattle at us a military saber built with our dollars  It seems that just as Stella

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and  China Breaks Silence on Muslim Detention Camps  Calling Them  Humane  I first heard about China s hidden internment camps through a snapchat news story  Located in Xinjiang  these camps hold tens of thousands of Muslims  The Chinese government refers to them as students  bragging on public media about their  generous  living conditions  However  the truth of the situation has been brought to light by various news sources  These Muslims are being brainwashed and stripped of their identities  Chinese officials ignore Islam values like the strict adherence to permitted  halal  foods and dress code  instead detaining Muslims and force feeding them communist propaganda It is shocking to see how individualism was not allowed fifty years ago and are still not allowed today  Reflecting on what happened to my grandparents during the Cultural Revolution  and seeing picture after picture of Muslims reciting laws and being forced to do hard  manual labor  I wondered how it was possible for oppressors to oppress  I realise now that this isn t a simple matter of empathy  Maybe the incentive is more of an absolute power for the communist regime In English class we watched the Ted Talk  The Danger of a Single Story  by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie  She spoke of how one version of what you hear has the power to totally infest your perspective on someone or something  Are these Chinese officials  the ones who are running the Muslim  schools   hearing single stories from the government  Are the Muslims trapped in these camps hearing single stories from these officials  When these shallow  one dimensional stories become somebody s truth  do we start forgetting about putting each other in each other s shoes  regardless of religions or customs

My job  when I am doing it right  is to please no one  I m a press lawyer  I m paid by this newspaper to vet stories before publication Think of me as a story s first and worst reader  doubtful  questioning  blind to subtlety  skeptical of the facts  regularly prodding editors and reporters to do something more or different  And if I have done my job well  many of the subjects of those same stories will be unhappy as well  but for all the reasons we want them to be  We got it right The basic idea of libel law is simple  A publisher can get sued for making a factual statement that proves to be false and hurts a person s reputation  For those of us charged with helping news organizations avoid libel suits  that means we learn to look at the world through the eyes of the person at the center of any tough story  often the bad guy in the tale I am all about the villains in many pieces   the doctor who botched the surgery  the insurance company that shafted its customers  the professor who hit on the student  the greedy industrialist who ground up workers to make a fortune  I try to look for the counternarrative that they could  and their lawyers will  build from the same set of facts  It s a counterintuitive form of reading  It s looking for the innocent explanation or the possibility that what appears to all the rest of the world to be nefarious may in fact just be a mistake made in good faith It s a tricky skill to take into the real world  When the guy at the grocery story with 17 items cuts in front of you in the express line  maybe you don t want to wonder whether he just honestly miscounted  17 can look a lot like 10   Or ponder the possibility that he sincerely thinks he is supposed to be counting food groups  not boxes  Or earnestly gauge the likelihood that he is a devoted father in a rush to get home to a sick and hungry child  Maybe you just want to go with irate and level a  I hope you die  sir  stare But for a libel lawyer  a little sympathy for the villain is almost an occupational requirement  And maybe it wouldn t be a bad idea for all of us in the tribalized  pick your side and stay on it  era we are living in Most Times stories don t take much of a legal lift  or any at all  But my approach was never more tested than in the 2016 campaign  I had been a Times lawyer for a decade and a half by then  Week after week  I was alternatively in the tank for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump  whoever happened to be the piñata on any given day  doing my part to make certain that our coverage was sound I have an old school vision of the First Amendment  that journalists should tell stories straight  that readers can be trusted and that out of that process we as a country will get it right more often than not Libel lawyers don t serve as the fairness police  If anything  they are more like fact cops  Coverage can be wildly unfair and still be true  And that is what matters to the law  Still  as the campaign ended and the Trump administration took hold  and as much as I continued to cling to a blind faith in the power of facts  it was impossible not to get drawn into the white hot debate over coverage in a politicized America It was a debate rippling across our democracy at a time when news operations were facing extraordinary financial challenges  Over the past half decade  The Times and others had reoriented themselves to reader centered journalism  The shift in attitude has been like opening a window after a long winter  Journalism should be done as if the readers mattered But in a divided America there was a risk  too   the risk that we would set our compass by what people wanted rather than giving them the journalism they needed  Among our readers  the appetite for stories that were unflattering to Mr  Trump and the people around him seemed insatiable  There were times  though  when we needed to tell other kinds of stories if we hoped to reflect the world as it was In late November 2016  Scott Shane of The Times s Washington bureau did a profile of Steve Bannon  at that time Mr  Trump s go to aide  It was a well reported piece of journalism done by the book  a profile of a newsmaker that had no ambition beyond letting readers know who this Bannon character was It set readers  hair on fire  Part of it was the digital headline that described Mr  Bannon as  combative  and a  populist  when many readers thought  racist    white supremacist  or  xenophobe  might have done the trick If people wanted to see Mr  Bannon as a menace to America  the facts for getting there were to be found in the profile  But if readers preferred to see Mr  Bannon as an enigmatic figure with a résumé that should have led him anywhere but where he ended up  the article gave that narrative  too  It was discouraging that so many people apparently believed that the time honored journalistic act of telling a story straight had become a problem and that The Times needed instead to take sides and coach readers on what to think Journalism is hard when people feel the failure to take sides is in and of itself a surrender  It is not an easy time to be speaking up for a journalism that follows the facts wherever they lead  even if our readers  or our president  don t want to be taken there By the time the profile of Mr  Bannon ran  the alt right and its enablers had become the masters of trying to silence all the voices they found disagreeable  It was not a model I thought we should emulate  The great risk we face comes not in giving them voice but in taking their worst instincts and making them our own At least that is the free press vision I tried to bring to my legal work  even as the president continued his toxic attacks on the press  But it wasn t always possible to hear the  fake news  drumbeat and shrug  In April 2017  the PR person for a gun control group wrote to us with a strange cheeriness   Just wanted to let you know that the N R A  has released another unhinged video  this time targeting N Y T  Apparently  they re  coming for you   Happy Friday  The video was another release from the National Rifle Association s media outlet  NRATV  featuring its favorite over the top talking head  Dana Loesch  the go to ringmaster for the group s propaganda circus  Wearing a white top offset by the all black background of the NRATV studio  Ms  Loesch spewed out her not quite controlled rage about fake news  directly addressing The New York Times   Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow   she announced   We re going to laser focus on your so called honest pursuit of truth  In short  we re coming for you  Many people at The Times found it chilling and pressed us to respond in some way  All of that was understandable  We have lived through too many death threats to our people  But I questioned whether we really wanted to give the N R A  and its fans the satisfaction of an official response from the company  The First Amendment gives a lot of protection to even nasty speakers  We stood down as a company  We were willing to let the hit piece fade into obscurity I was more than a little surprised  then  to pick up The Times a few months later and find spread across the Sunday Styles section a fairly glowing profile of none other than Dana Loesch  Online  the headline described her as  the National Rifle Association s telegenic warrior   The reporter and Ms  Loesch took what seemed like a lovely trip to the neighborhood shooting range  I think  upon reflection  it spoke well of The Times  Ms  Loesch was a person in the news  and we write about people in the news  not just the people we agree with I never heard whether Ms  Loesch considered the profile fake news  but four weeks later she was once again lighting up the screen at NRATV   literally  A new video showed Ms  Loesch holding up a lighter to a copy of The New York Times   You know  I don t even have to do this   she said   You guys are doing a good enough job burning down your reputations all by yourselves   Lovely But that is how the First Amendment works   thanks to our  profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited  robust and wide open   as Justice William Brennan said in the landmark Times v  Sullivan case  which raised the bar for libel suits against publications  Speakers are allowed to be provocative  colorful  contradictory and wrong It is a beautiful thing  Bizarre some days  but still beautiful RelatedA letter by David McCraw in response to Donald Trump was widely

Want the At War newsletter emailed to you  Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Friday The Times recently asked servicewomen and veterans to share stories about their military service for a project planned for today  International Women s Day  I wasn t surprised that we received more than 650 submissions to our reader call out  But reading the dozens of accounts that poured in each day filled me with a renewed sense of appreciation and frustration for these women s service  Too many had to force their way into an institution that has been designed for and upheld by men for generations  Too many were told they didn t belong  And too many felt the physical and mental consequences of disrupting and threatening the male dominated status quo in ways that should have been punishable   and yet were repeatedly ignored by senior military leaders 40 Stories From Women About Life in the MilitaryMarch 8  2019This collection of stories is both a celebration of women s military service and a reckoning of what they ve endured  It s also a recognition that the military still has a long way to go before we see any real resemblance of gender equality  As Capt  Ja Mia

The current focus on North Korea s growing arsenal obscures the fact that the most likely trigger for a nuclear exchange could be the conflict between India and Pakistan  Long among the world s most antagonistic neighbors  the two nations clashed again last week before  fortunately  finding the good sense to de escalate  The latest confrontation  the most serious between the two nations in more than a decade  gave way to more normal pursuits like trade at a border crossing and sporadic cross border shelling But this relative calm is not a solution  As long as India and Pakistan refuse to deal with their core dispute   the future of Kashmir   they face unpredictable  possibly terrifying  consequences The current crisis dates to Feb  14  when a Kashmiri suicide bomber killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary officers in the deadliest attack in three decades in the  divided region that both nations have claimed since partition in 1947  The militant group Jaish e Muhammad  which seeks independence for Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan  took responsibility  While it is on America s list of terrorist organizations and is formally banned in Pakistan  the group has been protected and armed by the Pakistani intelligence service Last week  India sent warplanes into Pakistan for the first time in five decades  Indian officials said they had struck Jaish e Muhammad s  biggest training camp  and killed a  very large number  of militants  although those claims have been called into doubt  Pakistan counterattacked  leading to a dogfight in which at least one Indian jet was shot down and a pilot was captured by the Pakistanis The situation could have easily escalated  given that the two countries have fought three wars over 70 years  maintain a near constant state of military readiness along their border and have little formal government to government dialogue Adding to the volatility  India s prime minister  Narendra Modi  is waging a tough re election campaign in which he has used anti Pakistan talk to fuel Hindu nationalism  With Pakistan s Army most likely shaken by the Indian raid and unwilling to slide into protracted conflict  Prime Minister Imran Khan returned the pilot to India  in what was seen as a good will gesture  called for talks and promised an investigation into the bombing  Mr  Modi took the opportunity to back off further escalation The next confrontation might not end so calmly Pakistan has never seriously cracked down on militant groups that attack India and the Indian controlled part of Kashmir  In recent days  Pakistani authorities said they detained 44 members of various armed groups  including a brother of Masood Azhar  the head of Jaish e Muhammad  and planned to seize assets of militants on the United Nations terrorist list  But Pakistan has rarely followed through on such promises Without international pressure  a long term solution is unlikely  and the threat of nuclear war remains China is a major ally and lender to Pakistan  and if it stopped blocking moves in the United Nations Security Council to add Mr  Azhar to the United Nations terrorist list  it would signal to Pakistan that it has to curb the militant groups While the Clinton  Bush and Obama administrations aggressively worked to ensure that India Pakistan confrontations in 1999  2002 and 2008 did not spiral out of control  the Trump administration has done little but issue a few statements urging restraint  It s hard to see a role as a mediator for Mr  Trump  who has shifted the United States more firmly against Pakistan and toward India  where he has pursued business interests  But the United States needs to get involved  It could help India strengthen its counterterrorism capabilities to prevent future attacks  and it could encourage India to modify its approach to those opposing its rule in Kashmir  which the United Nations and other groups say involves widespread human rights abuses that simply spawn more militants  And while it s good when India and Pakistan decide to walk back from the brink  as they seem to be doing now  the United States should be ready to assist if they cannot A solution to a conflict that touches so many religious and nationalist nerves must ultimately come from within  through talks among India  Pakistan and the people of Kashmir  It s a long shot  and the protagonists have shown no serious interest  but that s the reality nonetheless The two countries have crossed into dangerous territory  with India attacking Pakistan and engaging in aerial duels  The next confrontation  or the one after that  could be far more unthinkable Mired in Crisis  Pakistan Vows to Move Against Militant GroupsMarch 5  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram 
The Labor Department is proposing to expand overtime eligibility to include most salaried workers earning less than about  35 000 a year The new threshold would be substantially higher than the current level of about  23 700  but would cover fewer workers than an Obama administration initiative that was thrown out by a federal judge Under the proposal announced Thursday  most workers earning less than the new threshold must receive time and a half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week The department anticipates that the rule will expand overtime eligibility by just over one million workers  absent an intervention by their employers  such as raising their salaries The proposal will be subject to a 60 day public comment period  and the department expects it to take effect around January  The current threshold was set by the George W  Bush administration in 2004 The Obama administration set the salary threshold at about  47 500 when it put forward a new rule in 2016  But a federal judge in Texas suspended the rule just before it was to take effect  arguing that the administration lacked the authority for such a significant increase  The same judge later invalidated the Obama rule While the Trump administration has appealed the judge s decision  it asked the court to pause the appeal while it prepared a new version of the rule Heidi Shierholz  a former Labor Department chief economist who was involved in the Obama administration s effort  said that the threshold in the new proposal was at the upper end of what she had expected  but that she was still disappointed with the figure  Their analysis of the rule looks similar to what we did   said Ms  Shierholz  now director of policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute   The problem is their own analysis shows millions fewer workers get covered  But Tammy McCutchen  one of the architects of the Bush administration s increase  said she was pleased that the department had set the threshold at about the 20th percentile of earnings for salaried workers in the South   in line with where she and her colleagues had set it in 2004  I think that s what they had to do in light of the Texas court decision   said Ms  McCutchen  a lawyer at the management side firm Littler Mendelson   Anything higher would have been subject to challenge again  Many employers and business groups argued that while the 2004 threshold was in need of an increase  the magnitude of the Obama change was unreasonable Some argued that it would significantly increase costs for employers  who would either have to pay out hundreds of millions more in overtime or raise workers  salaries above the new threshold to avoid paying additional overtime  Many critics also said salaried workers would suffer a loss of status by having to account for their time the way hourly workers do The Obama administration argued that its proposal was modest by historical standards  noting that it would make fewer than 40 percent of salaried workers eligible for overtime pay based on their salaries  far less than the percentage who were eligible in 1975 Even so  it estimated that more than four million workers would gain the right to overtime pay under its rule Other skeptics argued that the change would have little impact because employers would lower the base wage of people who work significant overtime hours  leaving their total pay  including wages and overtime  roughly unchanged More liberal economists largely rejected this analysis and concluded that while base wages might fall somewhat  the increased overtime pay would more than offset the losses Employees who make more than the salary threshold are also eligible for overtime pay if they aren t executives  administrators or professionals   that is  workers who have significant decision making authority  But the Obama administration believed that employers were routinely flouting this so called duties test by labeling rank and file employees as managers  making a high salary threshold more important The Trump administration s original nominee for labor secretary  the fast food executive Andrew F  Puzder  was openly hostile to the Obama overtime rule  But after he withdrew his nomination under a personal controversy  his replacement  Alexander Acosta  struck more of a middle ground At his confirmation hearings in 2017  Mr  Acosta suggested that a reasonable salary threshold would be in the low  30 000s Last year  Mr  Acosta s department held a series of public  listening sessions  to solicit input from employers  business groups and worker advocates on where to set the threshold  Many in the business community echoed his  30 000 plus suggestion  while worker groups tended to favor the Obama threshold  At my confirmation hearings  I committed to an update of the 2004 overtime threshold  and today s proposal would bring common sense  consistency and higher wages to working Americans   Mr  Acosta said in a statement In addition to raising the salary threshold  the Obama administration s approach also required that it rise automatically every three years to keep up with salary increases  The new proposal does not seek to raise the threshold automatically  but suggests that it be updated through a new rule making process every four years 
DOHA  Qatar   Nearly 11 days after peace negotiations between the United States and the Taliban began with high hopes  it has become clear that any resolution to the 18 year war could be frustratingly slow One of the most prominent issues thwarting progress is a disagreement over a fundamental question  What is terrorism  and who is a terrorist The answer is so important because the two sides had already agreed in principle on a framework for two crucial issues  the withdrawal of American troops  and a commitment that Afghan soil would not again be used to launch terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies  as Al Qaeda did with its strikes on Sept  11  2001  That attack led the Americans to invade Afghanistan in an effort to hunt down Al Qaeda s mastermind  Osama bin Laden The Taliban have said they would not allow Afghanistan to be used as a launching pad for international attacks  American negotiators have insisted on specifying that Afghanistan not be used by  terrorist  groups  but the Taliban have resisted  saying there was no universal definition of terrorism The Taliban dragging their feet on one term might seem to be killing time  but officials  including current and former Taliban members  said it was a sensitive and existential issue for the group  It strikes at the core of the ideological narrative around their 18 year fight  If Taliban leaders were seen as conceding on the issue  it could divide their fighters ImageThe scene after a Taliban bombing in Kabul in January CreditWakil Kohsar Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBoth sides have remained tight lipped about the latest round of talks  saying only that negotiations were continuing But interviews with current and former officials on all sides  who spoke privately because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations  said the talks have nearly collapsed on several occasions  with deep  and at times emotional  disagreements A senior American official close to the talks said that while a significant outcome at the end of this long round was still possible  just the two sides engaging in a forthright and substantive discussion on difficult details had already moved the process forward The Taliban  seizing on momentum on the battlefield  are clearly seeking to negotiate from a position of confidence against Americans facing a ticking clock  with President Trump s desire to withdraw obvious to all   including the Taliban The two sides began the latest round expecting disagreements over the timeline of an American troop withdrawal  as well as the Taliban s stubborn refusal to include the Afghan government in talks about the country s political future ImageZalmay Khalilzad is leading the American side in the talks CreditJim Huylebroek for The New York TimesWhile the Americans have pushed for a gradual withdrawal over three years or longer  Taliban officials have said they want a withdrawal in less than a year  perhaps as soon as six months  The withdrawal would likely be tied to a cease fire that would be rolled out gradually  with violence ceasing in an area as the pullout begins But the issue that has proved particularly nettlesome has been the American demand for guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a place to plan attacks against the United States While the Taliban condemned the 2001 attacks on the United States  its regime did not give in to the American ultimatums to surrender bin Laden  Instead the Taliban asked for evidence to be presented at an international court that the attacks were planned in Afghanistan  When the United States resorted to military action  the Taliban promised to resist it as aggression As frustrations over the definition of terrorism grew in the talks  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  who is briefed regularly by his negotiators  made clear he considers the Taliban themselves terrorists  I have a team on the ground right now trying to negotiate with the Taliban terrorists in Afghanistan  trying to find a way to achieve an Afghanistan that s not at war   he said ImageThe day to day talks have largely been led for the Taliban by Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai CreditPavel Golovkin Associated PressRaising expectations around the latest talks was the presence for the first time of the Taliban deputy leader  Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar  His involvement spurred hopes that the Taliban negotiating team could swiftly make decisions  rather than checking frequently with their leaders in Pakistan But Mullah Baradar has rarely been present in direct negotiations between large groups  Officials say his health seems sapped by nearly a decade of detention in Pakistan  and he is being cared for by his young son Mullah Baradar s presence has  however  provided an important layer of troubleshooting  Every time there has been threat of a breakdown  the American chief negotiator  Zalmay Khalilzad  would get together with him to figure out how to cool off and resume talks The latest round of negotiations are taking place at a sprawling Doha resort  On most days  the talks ended after evening prayer  as a female musician played piano under a large chandelier of the hotel lobby behind curtains separating the talks from resort guests  When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan  they banned music   and women   from public life Lunch breaks have often provided odd juxtapositions  with American officers in their uniforms and boots  and the Taliban in their turbans  trying to tiptoe around the honeymooners and tourists sunbathing in neon bikinis by pristine pools ImageThe Taliban office in Doha  Qatar CreditOsama Faisal Associated PressThe day to day talks have largely been led by Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai for the Taliban  and Molly Phee  a former U S  ambassador to South Sudan and a deputy to Mr  Khalilzad  the American special envoy leading the negotiations  Ms  Phee was also involved in discussions about the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq as a member of the National Security Council during the Obama administration Much of the struggle at the negotiations has involved chipping away at an environment of mistrust  The Taliban think Americans may be using the talks to undermine their momentum on the battlefield  where they control or contest more territory than at any time since their fall in 2001 The Americans  and their Afghan allies on the sidelines  fear the Taliban are slowing negotiations to run down the clock  with President Trump already signaling he wants out of the war anyway For the Taliban  an agreement on the withdrawal of American troops would guarantee something of a victory in their military struggle  After 18 years of fighting  they would have forced American troops to leave  They see their strength in the military fight  but less so in politics and governing   as demonstrated by their struggle to run the country before the American invasion The discussions over the political future of Afghanistan could be messy  Taliban officials said that if they engage in that discussion before they have finalized the timeline for an American military withdrawal  it could affect their fighters  An insurgent army is harder to remobilize once dispersed It remains unclear how much the Taliban will compromise on the issue of political power  Although they have said they do not seek a monopoly  their posture has been one of uncompromising confidence  in part shown in their stubbornness to not meet with the Afghan government  That has raised fears that  even after a deal with the Americans  disagreement over power could continue the war in Afghanistan The Americans have so far tried to link any progress on a withdrawal timeline to the Taliban engaging with Afghans  including the government  Afghan political leaders regularly caution the chief American negotiator against any agreement with the Taliban on withdrawing troops that would result in the Americans losing their leverage before making progress on the political front  I am ready to even sacrifice my life for peace  but not for a peace that will be a new chapter of carnage   Afghan president Ashraf Ghani said in a speech on Wednesday 
The Census Bureau will tap Department of Homeland Security files on millions of immigrants  including noncitizens  as part of its data collection for the 2020 census  bureau officials said Thursday  The move comes as the Trump administration faces court challenges to its efforts to add a citizenship question to the next head count The Homeland Security files would include information on immigrants  citizenship status  addresses and birth dates  and Social Security numbers Experts and analysts outside the agency said the request for data on noncitizens  first reported by The Associated Press  had a number of plausible explanations   and did not necessarily mean the administration was trying to sidestep recent judicial rulings barring the citizenship question In fact the rulings have criticized the Commerce Department  which oversees the Census Bureau  for disregarding a federal law requiring officials to determine whether it can obtain information on noncitizens from federal files   before it burdens citizens with an additional question on census forms During internal deliberations over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 head count  Census Bureau analysts told Commerce Secretary Wilbur L  Ross Jr  that the question was unnecessary because existing federal files   including those in Homeland Security   could provide the same information more accurately and cheaply The Census Bureau said in a statement that it had not gathered data on noncitizens in recent censuses  but added that the new agreement with Homeland Security was neither unusual nor cause for concern The agency said that it routinely supplemented its economic and population surveys with personal files from other federal agencies like the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service  and that is required to strip all identifiable personal information from data it gathers before sharing statistics with the public or the rest of the government  Failure to do so is a federal crime The administration s attempt to add the citizenship question had another setback on Wednesday when a second federal judge barred the addition of the question  ruling that the administration ignored both federal law and the Constitution in its zeal to obtain information on noncitizens A final decision on whether the census can include the citizenship question now rests with the Supreme Court  which has set arguments on the issue for April Most analysts already believe that concerns about the proposed citizenship question will depress the response to the 2020 census among foreign born residents  That  in turn  could skew the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds that are allotted based on population figures  as well as the reapportionment of congressional and state political districts in 2021 On Thursday  critics said the agreement with Homeland Security would heighten fears among noncitizens and even legal immigrants that the administration was trying to sidestep such rulings and build a database of foreigners that could be used for prosecutions and deportations But they acknowledged that those fears are overblown  Federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from cooperating on such a venture  and the bureau s own rigid tradition of nonpartisan service would likely incite a revolt were it ordered to The Census Bureau  is clearly in an uncomfortable situation   said Andrew Reamer  a George Washington University research professor who closely follows Census Bureau data collection   But in my experience  it would never initiate on its own a data request to get around a court order  At the same time  he and other experts said  the fears were predictable  given that the Commerce Department has yet to offer a credible explanation as to why it wants to collect census data on noncitizens Federal courts in California and New York have both ruled that the official reason   that the Justice Department needs better data to enforce voting rights laws   is a pretext for some other undisclosed objective  It s understandable that it s alarming   said Terri Ann Lowenthal  a consultant on census issues who has advised groups that oppose the citizenship question   Given the anti immigration policies of the administration  people who are fearful for their security and their status would see this as another possible effort to harm them

WASHINGTON   Chelsea Manning  the former Army intelligence analyst who provided archives of secret military documents to WikiLeaks in 2010  was taken into custody on Friday after a federal judge found her in contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury that is investigating the antisecrecy group Judge Claude H  Hilton of Federal District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that Ms  Manning must stay in civil detention until she testifies  Ms  Manning had vowed not to cooperate in the investigation even though prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia granted immunity for her testimony In a statement posted on  Twitter after she was arrested  Ms  Manning said she had ethical objections to the secrecy of the grand jury system and  will not comply  with the subpoena The case is part of a long running criminal inquiry into WikiLeaks and its leader  Julian Assange  that dates to the Obama administration and which the Trump administration revived  Ms  Manning said on Thursday that prosecutors on Wednesday had asked her a series of questions about WikiLeaks before the grand jury  but she had responded to every question by saying it violated her constitutional rights Mr  Assange has been living for years in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid arrest  Prosecutors charged him under seal last summer  a fact they inadvertently revealed in a court filing in November The precise charge against him remains murky  but trying to convict him of a crime for publishing classified information he received from someone else would raise novel and profound First Amendment issues  The Obama administration had decided against trying to charge him because of fears that establishing a precedent that his actions were a crime could chill investigative journalism  Chelsea is a tremendously courageous person and this outcome was not unexpected but this an appealable order   said her lawyer  Moira Meltzer Cohen  after the hearing Joshua Stueve  a spokesman for the United States attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia  said the government did not want to confine Ms  Manning  relaying a statement that Tracy Doherty McCormick  a federal prosecutor  had made after the judge opened part of the contempt hearing on Friday  It has always been our intent and hope for her to testify and comply with the valid court order and valid grand jury investigation   Ms  Doherty McCormick said   Ms  Manning could change her mind right now and do so  It is her choice  This is a rule of law issue  and Ms  Manning is not above the law  During her court martial in 2013  Ms  Manning had admitted sending WikiLeaks large archives of secret documents  Her bulk disclosure vaulted the group and Mr  Assange to global fame years before WikiLeaks gained a different type of notoriety for publishing stolen Democratic emails that Russian hackers had stolen during the 2016 presidential campaign In a lengthy confession in 2013  Ms  Manning said she had interacted online with someone who was likely Mr  Assange  But she said she acted of her own accord and was not directed by anyone at WikiLeaks  Ms  Manning said prosecutors had wanted her to go over those same events  The grand jury s questions pertained to disclosures from nine years ago  and took place six years after an in depth computer forensics case  in which I testified for almost a full day about these events   she said in the statement   I stand by my previous testimony  I will not participate in a secret process that I morally object to  particularly one that has been historically used to entrap and persecute activists for protected political speech  A military judge in 2013 had sentenced Ms  Manning to 35 years in prison  and  and counting her time in pretrial custody  she served about seven years   by far the longest prison time any American has served for leaking government secrets to the public   before President Barack Obama commuted the remainder of her sentence in 2017  As a transgender person struggling to transition to life as a woman  she had a difficult time in a male military prison and twice tried to commit suicide in 2016 The contempt hearing on Friday was partly closed  but the judge had opened it for a portion in which Ms  Meltzer Cohen argued that Ms  Manning should be confined at home  The judge rejected that request and Ms  Manning was taken to the women s wing of the federal detention center in Alexandria  Va   Ms  Meltzer Cohen said Mr  Stueve said federal officials had taken steps to ensure that Ms  Manning s medical needs would be met while she remained in custody Confinement for defying a grand jury subpoena can last until the term of the jury is over  after which prosecutors would have to obtain a new subpoena and start the process over if they wanted to continue to press the issue  Both Ms  Meltzer Cohen and Mr  Stueve declined to say when the current jury s term is set to end 
LOS ANGELES   In an attempt to determine who was behind the caravans that were bringing large numbers of migrants from Central America to the southwest border  the Trump administration created a list of activists and journalists whom they subjected to additional scrutiny when they entered the United States last year Federal immigration authorities faced criticism on Thursday after an internal government document  obtained by NBC 7 San Diego  suggested that immigration activists and journalists were specifically singled out for extra screening at border entry points by the United States and Mexican governments Many of those on the list had traveled with the migrant caravans as they arrived in Mexican border cities from Central America to seek asylum  Others on the list  according to lawyers representing them  had provided legal assistance or aid to migrants  but had not traveled with the caravans at all Customs and Border Protection officials said they had identified people because they may have had information in connection to assaults against Border Patrol agents that took place last November and in January  but said that gathering this type of information was standard  C B P  does not target journalists for inspection based on their occupation or their reporting   Andrew Meehan  the agency s assistant commissioner of public affairs  said in a statement  adding that C B P   has policies in place that prohibit discrimination against arriving travelers and has specific provisions regarding encounters with journalists  Nonetheless  the inspector general for the Homeland Security Department opened an inquiry last month  with C B P    to ensure that all appropriate policies and practices were followed  In Washington  lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee sent a letter on Thursday to Customs and Border Protection criticizing the list and said it raised serious legal and constitutional questions Esha Bhandari  a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union  said that targeting reporters or advocates for secondary screening and extended detention on the basis of their work was a violation of their rights  Ms  Bhandari said the A C L U  was monitoring developments in the cases and exploring all legal options  The implications of this are really disturbing   she said   It is unconstitutional for the government to target people for punishment or retaliation solely based on their first amendment protected activity   Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  Go Nakamura  a freelance photographer whose work has appeared in The New York Times and who was on the list  said he had suspected for several months that his name had been flagged to immigration officials In an interview Thursday  he recalled being stopped by Mexican authorities in late December while he was near the border fence in Tijuana to take photographs of migrants  The officers asked to see Mr  Nakamura s passport  something he had not experienced during other lengthy assignments on the border  he said  He thought it was strange when the officers took photos of his passport on cellphones Mr  Nakamura  an American citizen  tried to re enter the United States several days later  and initially faced routine questions  He was asked about his background  where he lived  where he went to school  He was also asked about when he began working as a photojournalist But the questioning began to alarm Mr  Nakamura when an officer pulled out a document with pictures of about 10 to 14 faces and asked him to identify them  They asked me if I recognized any of the faces   Mr  Nakamura said   I didn t  so I said no  The officer who showed me the papers  she was asking me if I was connected with the organizers of the caravan  She was like  have you met the organizers or do I know the organizers   I felt like they thought I was a spy or something   Mr  Nakamura said Kitra Cahana  a freelance photographer on the list whose work has also appeared in The Times  said she was barred from entering Mexico on Jan  17while she was en route to photograph another caravan of migrants traveling through the country  As she was about to board a flight from Montreal to Detroit  she scanned her passport at a pre clearance machine  which printed out a picture with an  X over my face   She was taken into secondary questioning in Montreal  but was ultimately allowed to board her flight In Mexico City  she was again detained  That time she was held for about 13 hours  she said  before being officially denied entry to Mexico Mexican authorities confiscated her American passport and cellphone during that period  She was escorted to a flight back to Detroit  Later that month  on Jan  26  she said she tried to cross into Mexico from Guatemala  and was denied entry Ms  Bhandari said there were specific rules outlined by the Justice Department that the government must follow when questioning journalists  which  she said  Customs and Border Protection may have violated  The existence of these dossiers can have a real chilling effect   Ms  Bhandari said   It can suggest to other journalists that if they dare to report on activities that are embarrassing to the United States government  you too can be singled out for this harsh treatment

On a bright  cold morning last November  I walked Boston s Black Heritage Trail  a hidden gem among the city s trove of historic sites  I had followed it decades ago as a graduate student and was returning now with my mother after a recent move to Massachusetts  I was especially looking forward to revisiting one stop on the trail   Lewis Hayden s house  in the now affluent Beacon Hill neighborhood Hayden s story had made a strong impression on me  His immediate family was shattered by slavery  He had escaped from Lexington  Ky   not far from where I grew up in Ohio  and went on to build a remarkable life in Boston  Years after my first visit to the house  which was a stop on the Underground Railroad  I could still picture the green window shutters and elegant doorway  I associated Lewis Hayden with the place where I grew up  with family  perseverance and good will  So I was disconcerted by what I found when I arrived at the house that autumn day ImageThe Hayden House in Boston CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesThe ruddy bricks  green shutters and white curtains were just as I remembered them  But here was something new   a red  white and blue sticker on the windowpane trumpeting the National Rifle Association  This moment  which might not have caused a reaction in others  set me on a path of reflection  not just on the life of Hayden and those like him  but on the meanings of African American gun ownership and my own deeply held beliefs about guns  What I learned surprised me My response to seeing the sticker was strong  I am an African American historian and  on the matter of guns and most other political issues  decidedly liberal  To me  the pairing of Lewis Hayden and the N R A  felt like an affront  I knew for certain that Hayden fought for the right to be free from violent repression by white citizens wielding the weapons of guns  capital and political influence  I knew that he lost his family through a cruel  extractive system that reinforced   in fact  depended on   the ability of whites to inflict violence on the bodies of black people without legal repercussion ImageA National Rifle Association sticker next to the front door of the Lewis and Harriet Hayden House CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesThe N R A   on the other hand  has long been a boogeyman for me  I see it as an organization that stands in the way of laws to get automatic rifles out of the hands of people who might kill school children  hardened   or unresponsive   to the destruction that rampant gun violence wreaks  Who would plaster this flagrant symbol of white conservatism on the antique home of a black abolitionist who knew what it meant to be hunted  And why These questions nagged at me after my visit  I soon set out to get answers  I contacted the National Parks of Boston  who passed along my contact information to the private owners of the Hayden House  I expected to hear nothing back  instead  I received an invitation  I accepted and agreed to return to the house in February Beforehand  I reviewed the basic historical facts of Hayden s life  When Hayden was a boy  his owner  Adam Rankin  a Presbyterian minister   tore him from his mother and siblings and distributed them to different buyers  Rankin sold Hayden himself for a pair of carriage horses  a trade that honed the young man s scathing analysis of slavery s antihumanism In adulthood  Hayden s first wife and child were also snatched away for the market  Hayden somehow made a new life  remarried  had a son  escaped with his new family to Boston  and operated an apparel shop with his spouse  Harriet Hayden ImageAn old photograph  postcard and writing about Lewis Hayden  kept by the current owners of the historic house CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesAfter earning enough to purchase his freedom  ransoming the life that should have always been his own   Hayden organized a fund raiser to pay a  650 fine securing the release from jail of the white abolitionist who had aided his escape  a Methodist minister from the Midwest  Calvin Fairbank   Hayden chose the activist life  fighting for the dignity of others as part of what the historian Manisha Sinha called the  shock troops  of  fugitive slave rescues   in her book  The Slave s Cause   The home that the Haydens made  the one I would soon be visiting  became a refuge for the hunted On the day of my visit  the homeowners  Mary and John Gier  ushered me in with warm smiles and graciously served tea and cookies  The couple  who are proud of their heritage  English  Dutch  Irish and German  but resist hyphenated labels like  Euro American  or  African American   told me they bought the house in the 1970s  They cherish their historic home and have preserved or replicated most of the original features  cabinetry  doors  windows  flooring  fireplaces  and exterior brown brick  Even the 19th century tunnel is visible in the subbasement  Lovingly restored and furnished with period antiques  the house looks much the same as it might have during Hayden s residence   Harriet Beecher Stowe probably sat there having tea just like you are   they noted   This is the same room where Hayden met with his band of resisters  Mrs  Gier confirmed that the sticker was a relatively recent addition to the facade  but it was clear she and her husband saw the N R A  emblem as simpatico with the home s spirit  To them  Lewis Hayden is a  model for America   Mrs  Gier thinks if he were alive today  he would be a member of the N R A  or the National African American Gun Association   Can you imagine what would have happened had he not had his guns   she said   I believe that Hayden would have left no stone unturned to maintain his defense  In that sense  he is not unlike our law abiding citizens today who are protecting their constitutional rights  I am anti gun and support strict gun control laws  But sipping tea with the homeowners  walking the floors where the Haydens and their compatriots had plotted what turned out to be the roots of a political revolution to overturn slavery  pried ajar a little door in my mind ImageThe owners also have an old newspaper illustration that shows musket guns owned by Lewis Hayden CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesHayden was indeed a man who believed in firepower  He was legendary for threatening slave catchers who showed up at his doorstep in pursuit of fugitives  His home was  converted into a veritable fortress  with doors and windows double locked and barred   write the historians James Oliver Horton and Lois Horton in  Black Bostonians   The Hortons describe William and Ellen Craft s visit in 1848  after the pair fled Georgia in a brilliant escape from slavery  William posed as the property of his wife  a woman light enough to pass for white  Ellen dressed like a man to perfect the ruse  Their destination was the Hayden home where  as the story goes   Hayden s son and a number of armed men  secured the premises   Two kegs of gunpowder had been placed on the front porch  and while the slave catchers watched in disbelief  Hayden lit a torch threatening to blow up his house  himself  and anyone attempting to enter  While the historian Stephen Kantrowitz cautions in his book  More Than Freedom  that Hayden s actions were embellished over time  he traces the claim that  Hayden had readied kegs of gunpowder in the basement  in case slave hunters forced their way inside   to a statement by William Craft himself  Drawings of the interior of Hayden s home from an 1889 edition of The Boston Evening Transcript show rifles leaning against the back parlor wall above the caption   The Guns Were Always Ready for Use in an Emergency   ImageHarriet Tubman CreditFrom  Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman   by Sarah H  Bradford  1869 Of course  Hayden was not alone in his stance of armed self defense in the pre Civil War era  Ms  Sinha notes   Black abolitionists  especially those involved in the abolitionist underground and Vigilance Committees  tended to arm themselves   fugitive slaves  often resorted to armed self defense when confronted by slave catchers and law enforcement   The Underground Railroad activist Harriet Tubman was said to carry a revolver and did not hesitate to point it  according to her biographer  Sarah Bradford  Of course  just as racism and discrimination did not disappear  neither did the movement for black self defense  In the tumultuous civil rights era of the 1950s and  60s  black activists and community organizers openly took up arms  And not just those in the more explicitly militant Black Power movement  Martin Luther King Jr   several N A A C P  officials and other leaders perceived as much more dovish  still

about today  In what might be described as another moment of peril for African Americans   with rates of racially motivated hate crimes on the rise  organized white supremacist rallies and open advocacy of white power ideology becoming more common   black gun ownership has surged  The numbers increased markedly after the election of Donald Trump  according to reporting from NPR  Some identify as  gun comfortable   like the political scientist Jason Johnson  who attended the 2017 N R A  convention and concluded at The Root com that the event stoked  white fear of imaginary terrorists  black thugs and immigrants   Others are  super assertively pro gun   like Maj Toure  founder of Black Guns Matter  Mr  Toure is a former member of the N R A   and he told me in a phone interview that there are many more black members who will speak of their involvement only in  hushed tones   While he is critical of the N R A  for not doing more for urban Americans  he sees the group as an important civil rights organization In 2015  Philip Smith founded the National African American Gun Association in Georgia  His members  he said  are predominantly first time gun owners and educated professionals   engineers  doctors  state workers  federal workers  stay at home moms   While he has close ties to the N R A   Mr  Smith s goal was to build a black association that was  self governed  self maintained  self driven   Today  Mr  Smith said  the N A A G A  has 75 chapters in 30 states  He expects to be in every state within a year  Black gun owners are not a monolith  Mr  Smith stresses   We have black Republicans  Democrats  gay  straight   In what may come as a surprise to some  black women make up 60 percent of the association s membership  according to the group  Women are the ones  driving our organization  driving gun sales   he said  Even black gun owners preparing for natural or human made disasters   preppers    which he estimates make up about 5 to 10 percent of N A A G A  s membership  are growing in visibility ImageSharon Ross  creator of the website Afrovivalist  counsels and trains women of color who want to be armed CreditChad Brown for The

said she is preparing for extremes   climate disaster  even war   If there is some kind of race war   or whatever it might be   we re definitely outnumbered when it comes to firearms and bullets   In

segment of the show as well  In one scene he addresses a group of trainees  asking   What s our community going to do  Ask for help  From the Trump administration    Every other day on the internet we

struggles of two hundred years ago and conclude that wisdom compels armed defense Even as the survivalist movement took me a distance from my own experience  unlike Ms  Ross  I would have no idea how to kill a wild turkey and roast it for dinner   I began to wonder  What about those close to me  I took an informal family poll that left me reeling  I learned my relatives have guns  They store weapons in hidden chambers inside homes where we gather  they possess permits to carry concealed weapons and take target practice  they have friends who bring guns to church in case the congregation should need shielding  they are prepared to  protect my family no matter who comes through the door  and readying themselves for a  major environmental act  ImageMaj Toure  a former N R A  member founded Black Guns Matter in Philadelphia CreditDamon Winter The New York TimesImageJustin Harris at The Gun Range in Philadelphia CreditDamon Winter The New York TimesAt last  I was left having to examine myself   You re not anti gun   Mr  Toure told me   Ask yourself this  It s a zombie apocalypse  Tomorrow  you wake up  and you can t find your children  You go out to search for them  Do you want a gun now   His analogy was not outlandish  This was  of course  the constant threat enslaved people endured  Had I been fooling myself about my anti gun stance  I don t think so  but I did come to realize through a series of unexpected exchanges that the issue was more complicated than I had allowed and that my views of just coexistence and human flourishing might not require the absolute prohibition of arms I concede that Lewis Hayden could be viewed as a champion of the right to bear arms in defense of freedom  But more than that  he dedicated himself to community building  forging a complex  self funded  interracial network of people joined in common cause  Guns were there to defend those things  The home he made with Harriet was a gathering place for the Boston Vigilance Committee  for progressive white Bostonians and for members of the enslaved and free black population  Mr  Kantrowitz observed that Hayden sought to build  a world of common struggle against slavery in which racial hierarchy seemed to dissolve into human unity and affection   Together  Lewis and Harriet Hayden opened their doors to those on the run  turning their home into a haven for strangers whom the federal government deemed illegals This is the essence of his example that I hope our community and country will follow  After sipping tea at the Hayden House  I am still suspicious of the N R A   and I would not abide having a gun inside my dwelling or my children s schools  But where would I want to be if civil society topples and 2020 feels like 1820  In a home like the Haydens   in a neighborhood like the North Slope of 19th century Beacon Hill  in a community fortified by love in action and maybe a powder keg beneath the floorboards We want to hear from youOpinion  Readers  Join

CARACAS  Venezuela   Venezuela ground to a halt Friday as a national power blackout entered its second day  stalling public transportation  decimating already scarce food supplies  crippling the vital oil industry and threatening the lives of thousands of chronic patients A failure at the Guri hydropower plant  which provides the bulk of Venezuela s electricity  has left most of the country without power since Thursday afternoon  While power returned intermittently to parts of Caracas  the capital  by Friday afternoon  many states remained without electricity Officials in Venezuela quickly blamed the opposition and the United States for causing the blackout through  sabotage   but did not provide evidence  Guri is a militarized zone protected around the clock by soldiers Analysts and electricity sector contractors said the blackout was the result of years of mismanagement and corruption  which have brought the grid  transmission towers and generation plants to the breaking point  Not one of more than a dozen diesel  and natural gas powered backup plants built by the government in the last decade came online to compensate for the Guri outage  It s further evidence of the government s lack of resources to maintain critical infrastructure   said Risa Grais Targow  an analyst at Eurasia Group with expertise on Venezuela   It seems to be a transmission issue at Guri  which would normally be offset by thermoelectric generation but in this case isn t  both because of the decay in that infrastructure and potentially due to lack of thermal inputs to fire those plants  Elliott Abrams  the Trump administration s special representative for Venezuela  denied during a briefing on Friday that the United States bore any responsibility for the blackout  whether direct or indirect  through the sanctions it has imposed on the country  This is a multiyear decline in Venezuela   Mr  Abrams said   The situation there  due to the mismanagement  the economic policies and the sheer corruption of this regime  are the cause of those problems  President Nicolás Maduro has not addressed the nation since the start of the blackout  confining himself to one Twitter post on Thursday evening in which he said the  electrical war  unleashed by the United States against Venezuela would be defeated  His public silence has fed the tension gripping Caracas In his absence  the opposition leader Juan Guaidó took to the streets of eastern Caracas Friday to question Mr  Maduro s explanation and denounce his poor governance ImageThe opposition leader Juan Guaidó rallied supporters in Caracas  Venezuela s capital  on Friday to denounce government mismanagement CreditRayner Pena EPA  via Shutterstock Sabotage is corruption  sabotage is lack of free elections  sabotage is the blockade of food and medicine   he posted on Twitter  His message is likely to be lost to most Venezuelans  who remain without power or cellular coverage Mr  Guaidó  who claimed Venezuela s presidency earlier this year  pointing to evidence of fraud in Mr  Maduro s re election  has called the population to demonstrate on Saturday The Maduro administration has been responsible for grossly mismanaging the economy and plunging the country into a deep humanitarian crisis in which many people lack food and medical care  He has also attempted to crush the opposition by jailing or exiling critics  and using lethal force against antigovernment protesters The blackout may further anger the population and increase pressure on Mr  Maduro  and if it does not end soon  could fuel clashes in the coming days  said Ms  Grais Targow  On the political and social front  it s problematic for a government that is trying to avoid any potential catalysts for social explosions in an already tense political and social environment   she said of the blackout   So far  the population seems to be relatively calm  but if this persists without resolution and starts to hit food supplies and hospitals  ability to function more severely  the popular backlash will probably be severe  As much of the country remained without electricity  the sole television station transmitting to the few households with power mostly showed soap operas and old news Downtown Caracas was largely empty Friday morning  The government canceled classes and most shops  banks and government buildings  including the Ministry of Electric Power  remained shuttered  Units of special police forces patrolled the main streets  where groups of public sector workers loitered in vain hope of resuming work Backup generators buzzed around hospitals  which were trying to keep the most vulnerable patients alive About 50 babies requiring intensive care are born in Venezuela daily  and there are about 15 000 kidney patients in the country who need dialysis treatment  said Jaime Lorenzo  head of the Venezuelan medical charity Médicos Unidos  They could die if the power is not restored  he said In the emergency rooms of Dr  José María Vargas Hospital in Caracas  doctors scrambled to rotate critical patients on the few pieces of equipment connected to a backup generator ImageGovernment workers trying to get generators to start in downtown Caracas  Many people lacked oil to power their generators CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York Times There were stretchers jumbled everywhere in the emergency and doctors taking off oxygen masks from some patients to put them on others   said Belisario Jiménez  52  who was admitted to the hospital s intensive care unit after falling down a set of stairs   A lot of us are going to die here  At least I have lived my share  At the Olam Deli bakery in downtown Caracas  workers scrambled in darkness to sell the remaining loaves of bread before they went bad  They said the power cut had soured a day s worth of dough  worth the equivalent of 56 minimum monthly wages in the country  The bakery s supply of expensive cheese and cold meats sat in a thawing freezer  All I can do is pray that the power comes back before I lose everything   said the bakery s manager  Kevin  who asked that his last name not be used for fear of government reprisal The blackout will further depress Venezuela s already collapsing economy  which is being squeezed by bad governance  graft and sanctions imposed by the United States  The sanctions have affected Venezuela s ability to import and produce the fuel required by the thermal power plants that could have backed up the Guri plant once it failed The power failure risks hurting the already declining oil production  Venezuela s main source of revenue  by damaging equipment and operational systems  said Ali Moshiri  formerly the top Chevron executive overseeing company operations in Venezuela  All of the oil field production is tied into the public grid and if the public grid goes down  those fields get shut in   he said  He added that for years he had advised the government to install independent power supplies for the oil fields to guarantee reliability  but officials did not follow up To add to the regime s economic woes  a World Bank arbitration panel on Friday awarded ConocoPhillips  an American oil company  more than  8 billion for Venezuela s seizure of the Houston based company s production assets in 2007  Venezuela may appeal An earlier arbitration awarded ConocoPhillips  2 billion  which Venezuela agreed to pay last year when the company began seizing the Caribbean assets of Pdvsa  the national oil company To many Venezuelans  conditions already feel unsustainable  At the hospital  one of the doctors who spent the overnight shift trying to keep intensive care patients stable broke into tears outside the neurosurgery unit  Yesterday I felt impotence   said Rosangel Zuta  about the night spent trying to help and protect patients without the proper equipment to do so   I am angry  This time  it was my patients  but what if later on  it is my family  
Each week  technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week s news  offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry  Want this newsletter in your inbox  Sign up here Hi  I m Jamie Condliffe  greetings from London  Here s a look at the week s tech news Can Facebook profit from privacy You can t have missed it  Facebook plans to shift people toward private messaging and away from the public broadcasting on which its business was built  Think encrypted communications among smaller groups of people  and ephemeral messages that can be deleted  In theory  that change could help the company overcome some of the problems it has faced But Facebook has promised privacy features before that have never appeared   something skeptics were quick to point out after the plan was revealed on Thursday  I understand that many people don t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy focused platform   Mark Zuckerberg  the company s chief executive  wrote in a 3 200 word manifesto describing the shift If we are to assume he means it  there s still a huge problem  He lacks a business model A shift to a private Facebook would crimp its current revenue streams  Most of its profits come from targeted ads enabled by the open sharing of content  In the encrypted future that Mr  Zuckerberg imagines  that will be hard  The company would also effectively rule out expansion into big potential markets like Russia and China  because it won t run servers in countries with authoritarian governments So how can it make money  Mr  Zuckerberg mentions commerce and payments  which fits with reports that Facebook is building a cryptocurrency  But that s all he says  really Mr  Zuckerberg seems O K  with the lack of a plan   The basic way that we ve approached things is first to focus on building the consumer service that people really want   he said to Wired   That will be the foundation  If we do that well  the business will be fine  Of course  a trick for monetizing private messaging may be hidden in his back pocket  If it isn t  his critics  skepticism may be proved right Big Tech antitrust  in the HouseEarlier in the week  Representative David Cicilline  the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the House antitrust subcommittee  proposed an idea to curb Big Tech s dominance During the Great Depression  the Glass Steagall Act forced banks to separate commercial and investment banking operations  Mr  Cicilline told the Financial Times that something similar could apply to tech  It s an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information   he said Sadly  this feels like a nonstarter  Splitting the operations of banks was relatively straightforward  the data sales and platform components of companies like Google and Facebook are  whatever Mr  Zuckerberg says  deeply intertwined Still  it s probably one of many options   There aren t easy answers  to Big Tech antitrust questions  Mr  Cicilline said to Bloomberg Opinion in January   We re not going to approach this  like   Here s my solution   He has the wind at his back  Congressional hearings with Facebook and others last year revealed that lawmakers in both parties have antitrust concerns about tech companies  And the Federal Trade Commission recently announced a task force of 17 lawyers dedicated to  monitoring competition in U S  technology markets   The commission s director of competition  Bruce Hoffman  said some companies could be forced to  spin off  previous acquisitions How far these efforts will go   and how quickly   remains unclear  It may be difficult to prove violation of federal antitrust law until the laws are updated to better apply to technology companies  And splitting a company like Facebook or Google would require costly  lengthy legal battles that the government may yet balk at Who s to blame for robo car deaths Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they wouldn t charge Uber with a crime after one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian last year  Instead  they said investigators should look into what the safety driver  would or should have seen that night  One interesting point about the news was raised by Frank Douma  a researcher at the University of Minnesota s Center for Transportation Studies  It s a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision making  The  handoff problem    that humans are too easily distracted to safely retake control of an autonomous vehicle in an emergency   is well documented  The Uber accident provided a first glimpse of how the law would deal with that issue  It suggests that  for now  the onus remains on the  driver  Huawei is angry  Maybe too angry The Chinese telecom giant Huawei sued the United States government on Wednesday over a ban that prevents government agencies from using the company s products because they may violate national security  Days earlier  Meng Wanzhou  the company s chief financial officer  sued the Canadian authorities for arresting her Huawei is aggrieved by the Trump administration s hardware ban and its lobbying of other governments to shun the company s products when building 5G wireless data networks  The lawsuits are just one response  A defensive advertising campaign and outspoken interviews were already in play Those more conventional lobbying approaches may have been working  Countries like Britain and Germany  which have considered the White House s pleas  have wavered and may ultimately use Huawei hardware But the lawsuits make Huawei look rash and aggressive  Is that the kind of company a government wants to help build critical infrastructure And some stories you shouldn t missThe National Security Agency stopped its controversial phone spying  The system  which analyzed logs of Americans  domestic calls and texts and was introduced to surveil conspirators in Al Qaeda  has been scrapped Google said it was paying male workers too little  It gave  9 7 million in additional compensation to level things up for 10 677 employees  about 69 percent of them men  But the survey that led to the raises did not address a critical question  Are women hired at a pay grade below their qualifications Net neutrality is back in Washington  Congressional Democrats announced bills that seek to reinstate net neutrality rules  Whether the bills can pass is another matter Chinese hackers hit universities  An elaborate set of attacks sought to steal research about military maritime technology Artificial intelligence cameras can spot shoplifters before they steal  Software can identify  restlessness and other potentially suspicious body language   according to Bloomberg  You don t know data overload  Gizmodo invites you

The first thing you notice about the filmmaker Gregg Araki is his hands  It is two weeks before the premiere of his first foray into television   Now Apocalypse   and he s sitting on the walled off patio of a Starbucks in North Hollywood as unseen cars whiz behind him  While he describes the show as the  culmination of every movie I ve ever done   his legacy is tattooed across his knuckles   NOW HERE  The tattoo is a reference to  Nowhere   his seminal 1997 portrait of Gen Xers raised in the shadow of the H I V  AIDS crisis  having sex  getting high and getting obliterated by an unexplained reptilian menace  Films like  The Living End    Mysterious Skin  and  Kaboom  further cemented his preoccupation with  in Araki s words   sexually confused young people  in End Times America  Now Apocalypse   a half hour comedy that begins Sunday on Starz  shows the years haven t changed him  Written by Araki and Karley Sciortino  a sex columnist at Vogue  the series picks up where those films left off  Avan Jogia  TV s  Caprica   plays Uly  a 20 something slacker who can t tell if doomsday is upon us or he just smoked too much pot  The show shares the trappings of Araki s earlier work   alleyway hookups  three ways with Antifa protesters  alien lizards   but his trademark obsessions are especially timely in this politically charged cultural climate In a recent interview  Araki discussed what it took for one of the key figures of the New Queer Cinema era to make a show so fitting with the Trump era  These are edited excerpts from the conversation ImageFrom left  Juno Temple  Thomas Dekker and Haley Bennett in Araki s film  Kaboom  CreditMarianne Williams IFC Films Kaboom  was initially envisioned as a TV show before it became a feature film  Why did you feel it was time to take another crack at a series I ve been wanting to do a TV show like this for at least 20 years  I m really excited about the idea of TV because you can tell this longer story  and you develop a different relationship with TV than you do with a movie  Because it comes into your house every week  these people become very much like your friends  My friends and I talk about  Sex and the City  like they re friends of ours  Now Apocalypse  reminded me of that doomsday paranoia you were tapping into back in 2010 with  Kaboom   It felt even more relevant today  Do you feel the world has become more like a Gregg Araki movie in the past nine years When Karley and I first wrote   Now Apocalypse    we started during the twilight years of the Obama administration  That s why the show has that almost utopian quality of free love   these kids having sex and figuring themselves out  Then 2016 happened  There s always been that darker  Lynchian aspect of the show  but that became more pronounced  The specific example I give is Episode 1  when Ulie and Gabriel are in front of the coffee shop after their date and they re kissing good night  then the fag bashers drive by  That was actually added after 2016 because it was that feeling of the world being a little more dangerous than it used to be ImageTyler Posey  left  and Avan Jogia in a scene from the TV series  Now Apocalypse   The show barters in  among other things  alleyway hookups and alien lizards CreditKatrina Marcinowski StarzIt s interesting that you describe the show as a utopia because of the furtiveness of male male relationships in your previous work  There are all these scenes in  Doom Generation  of the male characters looking at each other with such longing but never knowing quite how to articulate it  In  Now Apocalypse   there s so much sex  How has your own relationship with depicting sexuality onscreen evolved The political world we live in right now is all about  Make America Repressive Again   We ve made so much progress since I started making films  The world has changed so much   for the better   that it s really upsetting to me to go backward after we ve come so far  The overriding message of the show is that people should be able to just be themselves and live their lives without fear of violence or oppression In  Now Apocalypse   one of the characters says sexual fluidity is a  requirement  for the new generation  but your depictions of adolescence have always shown different facets of queerness  Did that feel more true to your own experience When we were at Sundance  Karley said   I saw  Nowhere  when I was 18 and I had blue hair and was living in London  That movie changed my life  I d never seen a depiction of sex  sexuality and fluidity like that before   I believe that sexuality is on a spectrum  There are people that are 99 percent straight and 99 percent gay  but there s a lot of people in between  The world   and particularly young people today   are much more open to that ImageFrom left  Roxane Mesquida  Beau Mirchoff  Jogia and Kelli Berglund in  Now Apocalypse  CreditKatrina Marcinowski StarzWhat has it been like for you to see the movement that L G B T Q  people have made in the past couple of decades I think it s fantastic  I do think that we live in a little bit of a bubble here in L A   New York or San Francisco  It s not so easy for kids in Idaho or North Dakota   these places that are not as accepting and open minded  That s one of the most exciting things for me about  Now Apocalypse   Because it s TV  it s not something like  Kaboom  or  Nowhere  where it s like   Oh  I ve got to figure out where to see this if there s a theater anywhere within 100 miles of here   Some closeted kid in some faraway town somewhere can watch this show  and it s really rewarding for me as a filmmaker that it could give a kid like that hope It must feel surreal for you because preservation has been so unkind to many of your movies  For a long time  one was stuck with mostly VHS copies with terrible audio  if you could find the films at all  Now you have the resources of a multimillion dollar cable network My first film at Sundance was  The Living End   It was this 16 mm punk rock movie  and we made it for  20 000  It was so wild  however many years later  to be back at Sundance with this show that s on Starz   My work  started out in the early  90s as something that was so far out of the mainstream   just this weird indie movie   but now you drive down Sunset and there s a billboard  for  Now Apocalypse   next to the billboard for  A Star Is Born   It s really mind boggling for me If you had a Season 2  what would you hope to tackle Everything  The model of the show is very much like  Girls    Insecure  and  Looking    HBO R rated sex comedies  But the problem with those shows in 2019 is that you really run out of stories  By Season 2  everybody s  expletive  everybody  Everybody s cheated on everybody  and there s nowhere to go  Those shows die on the vine really quickly  This show has always had this other layer  which is this sci fi  surreal aspect of it For me  that s the wild card that keeps the show alive  I always wanted the show to be really unpredictable  I hate shows where you feel like   I know where this is going   That s what happens in these millennial comedies is that you already know what s going to happen  I love  Insecure  to death  but the last season  I wanted something to happen  I ve seen it all already When we started the scripts for Season 2  I told  Gregory Jacobs  an executive producer    I just don t want to repeat Season 1   We re about six scripts into Season 2  It s going to be amazing  I hope we get to do it 
MOSCOW   On a rainy afternoon this week  a group of Russian officials and oil executives gathered for Mass in a Catholic church tucked away behind the imposing secret service headquarters in central Moscow They did not come to pray  Instead  they were commemorating the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez  who poured billions of dollars into Russian weapons and machinery  and showing support for his embattled successor  Nicolás Maduro Mr  Maduro is fighting to save the political system he and Mr  Chávez have built  with Russian support  for two decades  Mr  Maduro s catastrophic economic mismanagement has led the opposition to claim the country s leadership with the support of the United States  the European Union and most South American nations To Russia  it was the latest attempt by the West to topple an adversarial government and check President Vladimir V  Putin s global outreach  The Kremlin reacted by closing ranks around Mr  Maduro and offering him unequivocal diplomatic support  which was on display at St  Louis of France Church on Wednesday Russia s top Latin America diplomat  Alexander Shchetinin  and Igor Sechin  the powerful chief of Russia s biggest state owned oil company  Rosneft  were among those who laid flowers on Mr  Chávez s memorial  But behind the official show of unity  Russia s economic and political elites are becoming increasingly divided on how best to preserve their interests As Mr  Maduro and the opposition leader  Juan Guaidó  settle into a war of attrition  the Kremlin faces a stark choice  to double down on its ally or to be among those who choose his successor The path Mr  Putin takes will help determine whether Venezuela peacefully changes government  slides into civil war or consolidates as a repressive pariah under Mr  Maduro  Russia s global image and weight is at stake in Venezuela   said Vladimir Rouvinski  political scientist at the Icesi University in Cali  Colombia   The initial shock and fear in Russia that they would lose everything in Venezuela is being replaced by the possibility that they can become part of a negotiated transition and ensure their interests are respected  ImageMarking the anniversary of Hugo Chávez s death in Moscow in 2016 CreditGrigoriy Sisoev Sputnik  via Associated PressThese interests range from Venezuelan oil projects and military contracts held by Russian state firms to the geopolitical value of having an anti American ally in the Western Hemisphere In recent years  Rosneft has emerged as Venezuela s biggest oil partner and lender of last resort  taking stakes in five crude producing projects and lending Mr  Maduro s government around  7 billion in return for oil  Venezuela still owes Rosneft about  2 3 billion  according to a company presentation in February Venezuela also owes  3 1 billion to the Russian Finance Ministry for weapons  trucks and grain purchased on credit  Finally  Moscow s state arms exporter has lucrative contracts to maintain Venezuela s Russian made tanks  fighter jets and air defense systems  These are significant sums  but it s not something that would sink the Russian economy   said Alexander Gabuev  a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center   It s about Putin s ability to project Russia as a global power  Close ties with Venezuela have allowed Mr  Putin to challenge America in its backyard  Both Mr  Chávez and Mr  Maduro have traveled to Russia  visiting machine gun factories and state farms  Mr  Chávez was one of the few leaders to recognize the Russian backed separatist republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia  while Mr  Maduro supported the Russian military campaign in Syria Russia responded with symbolic gestures like flying a Russian chamber choir to Mr  Chávez s hometown and inaugurating a Hugo Chávez street in Moscow These economic and personal ties have made Russia arguably the only ally besides Cuba that can exert influence on Mr  Maduro  said Mr  Rouvinski  the political scientist  They have also raised the costs of Mr  Maduro s downfall to the Kremlin To try to loosen these ties  Venezuela s opposition has repeatedly said that Russia s investments would be respected by a new government  The country will need capital to recover from its dire economic crisis  they said  and Russian companies would be welcome in the reconstruction ImageIgor Sechin  left  with Mr  Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in Maiquetia  Venezuela  in 2017 CreditMiraflores Palace  via ReutersBy sticking with Mr  Maduro  Russia increases the opposition s dependence on America  which could lobby a new government to cancel Rosneft s contracts and send Russian weapons to the scrapyard  the opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado said  The longer they wait  the more they risk losing everything   he said   Their investments are safe here  but they need to come to the negotiating table before it is too late  The Trump administration has repeatedly said that all options are on the table to force Mr  Maduro s exit  including military intervention  a specter that has split Russian policymakers On one side are pragmatic technocrats and career diplomats who believe Mr  Maduro s disastrous economic performance makes his government unsustainable Russian diplomats have reopened channels with Venezuela s opposition after a brief halt following Mr  Guaidó s proclamation  according to opposition leaders and people close to the Russian Foreign Ministry In public statements  Russian Foreign Ministry officials have gone in the past few weeks from unequivocally supporting Mr  Maduro to offering to mediate negotiations with the opposition or hold talks on Venezuela with the United States  Venezuela has largely disappeared from the saber rattling talk shows of Russian state television This contrasts with the hard line position taken by Russia s defense and security establishment  which includes Rosneft s Mr  Sechin  a former KGB officer  They see Venezuela s political crisis as part of a global campaign of American subversion against Russia  and believe backing Mr  Maduro is a matter of principle and self defense America s  goal is liquidation of governments of inconvenient countries  the undermining of sovereignty   Russia s chief military strategist  Gen  Valery V  Gerasimov  said at a conference in Moscow last week   Such actions are currently observed in Venezuela  ImageForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez of Venezuela at a news conference in Moscow last week CreditPavel Golovkin Associated PressRosneft has emerged as Mr  Maduro s economic lifeline since the United States slapped crippling sanctions on Venezuela s oil industry in late January  The company said it will lift its production in the country this year and has begun to take up some of the Venezuelan oil exports that used to go to America Rosneft s delivery of gasoline and oil diluent to Venezuela has helped the state owned Petroleos de Venezuela  known as Pdvsa  avoid collapse  It has also been good business for Mr  Sechin  Left without alternative buyers  Pdvsa is forced to sell to Rosneft at a steep discount  according to a Rosneft official and oil trader with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity  Sechin has positioned himself to Putin as Venezuela s curator  the person who will keep the Russian flag flying there   said Mr  Gabuev of Carnegie Center   He has too much wagered on Maduro  Beyond Rosneft s opportunistic oil buying  the Kremlin s effective support of Mr  Maduro is checked by Russia s economic realities Real income in Russia has stagnated since Mr  Putin annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014  sapping domestic support for foreign interventions like Mr  Putin s campaign to prop up Syria s Bashar al Assad  How much milk can we provide to our kids if we don t build another missile for Syria   asked Maria Potapova  a manager at the Blagoveshchensk Dairy Plant in Russia s Far East   They have all the money for Crimea and Syria  Why not spare some for us  The threat of American sanctions has scared away most Russian corporations still doing business in Venezuela  Russia s second largest oil producer  Lukoil  said last month it had stopped trading Venezuelan oil  the state run Gazprombank  once one of Pdvsa s main bankers  has stopped opening new accounts for Venezuelan clients  Even small time orchid importers have left the country A  1 5 billion Kalashnikov machine gun plant built by the state run RosTec in Maracay  meant to symbolize Russia and Venezuela s military cooperation  remains an empty shell 12 years after the start of construction Conditions in Venezuela are terrible and the government has to change  said a person involved in the RosTec project  who spoke on condition of anonymity What Russia wants  he added  is to have a say in who comes next 
WASHINGTON   The Federal Trade Commission has no shortage of critics who say it cannot protect Americans from the prying eyes of Big Tech  Instead of forceful action against the likes of Facebook and Google  they say  the F T C  leans on rules that make it hard to impose penalties bigger than rounding errors for the companies Those critics have an unusual champion  Joseph J  Simons  the man running the agency  We have this over 100 year old statute that is our main authority   Mr  Simons said in his first sit down interview since becoming chairman 10 months ago   And clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issues  In the deregulatory era of the Trump administration  Mr  Simons  60  a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than 30 years  is a rare voice for strengthening the government s hand Mr  Simons has urged Congress to expand the F T C  s privacy enforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily  write new rules and hire more experts  He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits   not just technology companies   collect and handle people s digital data But none of those changes will happen before Mr  Simons must make the most anticipated decision on data privacy in the agency s history  In the coming weeks  he and the F T C  s four other commissioners are expected to conclude an investigation into whether Facebook violated its promises to protect people s data The outcome of the case is seen as a referendum on the government s ability to rein in tech giants that have amassed incredible wealth and power from collecting and bartering user data  The F T C  s decision on Facebook will be highly consequential  for the F T C  and Facebook  for the tech industry  and for consumers   said David Vladeck  who led consumer protection at the agency during the Obama administration   The commission s action will set the bar  The case has taken on huge significance in Washington  where Facebook has become Exhibit A for an industry accused of a wide range of problems  from enabling foreign election interference to crushing competitors A rising chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has criticized the F T C  for not restraining the companies  data collection practices  which are central to some of their businesses  The agency s biggest penalty on a tech company was a  22 million fine imposed on Google in 2012  for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools  Google reported  50 billion in revenue that year On Friday  Senator Elizabeth Warren  the Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president  announced a sweeping plan to strengthen regulations against big tech companies  The F T C  has been a disappointment with its lack of enforcement in the past  which for Facebook and Google has amounted to a slap on the wrist   Senator Josh Hawley  a freshman Republican from Missouri  said in an interview  Mr  Hawley investigated Google for competition violations when he was a state attorney general The Facebook investigation is focused on whether the social network violated a 2011 consent decree in which it promised to protect user data and inform users of changes in how their data was used  The inquiry started last March under Mr  Simons s Republican predecessor  Maureen Ohlhausen  after a report in The New York Times revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had analyzed the data of 87 million users without their permission The agency is considering imposing a multibillion dollar fine on Facebook as well as new requirements to strengthen protections on how data is collected and shared  according to two people close to talks between the agency and the company  The two sides have discussed a possible settlement for weeks  said the people  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing Facebook declined to comment about Mr  Simons and the investigation  The social network has defended its actions  saying that when it learned a researcher violated its terms of service by giving user data to Cambridge Analytica  it demanded that the data be destroyed and was promised that it had been On Wednesday  the company announced plans to shift to a more privacy focused platform  Mark Zuckerberg  the company s chief executive  said Facebook would invest in encrypted communications and refashion its messaging tools to emphasize private conversations ImageMr  Simons and his agency s four other commissioners are investigating whether Facebook violated its promises to protect personal data CreditT J  Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesMr  Simons declined to discuss the Facebook case  And he was even guarded about his own use of technology  He would not say whether he used Facebook or two other popular apps owned by the company  Instagram and WhatsApp  He doesn t use other social media like Twitter  he said  aides write the tweets from his official F T C  account  I don t even know how to access my account   Mr  Simons said His comfort zone is antitrust regulation  a major focus for the F T C  and an area in which he has worked for most of his career  In his meticulous office  Mr  Simons keeps handy a worn Yale Law Journal with red plastic tabs on antitrust articles  He has had six of its authors speak at the F T C  since he arrived In one of his first actions as chairman  he held hearings on updating merger reviews and antitrust enforcement in the digital age  In late February  he announced a task force of 17 antitrust staff members to study potential problems that could arise from past tech mergers  In antitrust  you want to focus on areas where there is likely to be market power or monopoly power   Mr  Simons said   So it is not unreasonable to look at big digital platforms and say  well  that might be an ripe area to look at  He is new to the world of data privacy and admits he is cramming to understand it  immersing himself in articles and grilling staff about data protection  But that  he said  allows him to bring a  fresh perspective  to privacy enforcement  I am willing to look at everything with a fresh eye  and to question long held beliefs and assumptions   he said The F T C  monitors whether companies like Google  Uber and Facebook break promises written into privacy policies  But it can t directly fine a company for a first time offense  it can only charge a company with deceptive or unfair business practices  which the agency must prove in court  The potential penalty against Facebook could reach billions of dollars because the case hinges on whether it violated a previous settlement Mr  Simons argues that the agency needs more direct authority to oversee privacy practices and fine companies  He says it is too hard to prove to a court that someone has been harmed by a company s unauthorized use of their data  It s important that we get civil penalty authority   he said   For companies that have lots of money  the impact would be sufficient to deter them  Privacy groups say the agency has missed numerous opportunities to punish companies with its existing powers  Many compare the commission with European regulators  which have levied hefty fines on Google  Facebook  Amazon and Apple for violating antitrust  privacy  tax and security laws Some privacy advocates are also concerned about Mr  Simon s inexperience in the area  saying it requires a deep understanding of complicated technologies  I don t think he understands the dimensions and implications underlying the consumer privacy threat   said Jeffrey Chester  executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  a nonprofit consumer advocacy group Mr  Simons said there were obvious differences between how the United States and Europe viewed privacy  The E U  has this strong sense of the right to be forgotten   he said   We don t have that  We have the opposite of that  We have the First Amendment  And he said the details of how the government handled digital privacy should be for lawmakers  not him  to sort out  Privacy involves very important societal and cultural values that really need to be determined by the Congress   Mr  Simons said  pointing toward Capitol Hill  less than a mile up Pennsylvania Avenue from his office  Not   he said   by unelected F T C  commissioners  
When the Education Department approved a proposal by Dream Center  a Christian nonprofit with no experience in higher education  to buy a troubled chain of for profit colleges  skeptics warned that the charity was unlikely to pull off the turnaround it promised What they didn t foresee was just how quickly and catastrophically it would fail Barely a year after the takeover  dozens of Dream Center campuses are nearly out of money and may close as soon as Friday  More than a dozen others have been sold in the hope they can survive The affected schools   Argosy University  South University and the Art Institutes   have about 26 000 students in programs spanning associate degrees in dental hygiene and doctoral programs in law and psychology  Fourteen campuses  mostly Art Institute locations  have a new owner after a hastily arranged transfer involving private equity executives  More than 40 others are under the control of a court appointed receiver who has accused school officials of trying to keep the doors open by taking millions of dollars earmarked for students The problems  arising amid the Trump administration s broad efforts to deregulate the for profit college industry  began almost immediately after Dream Center acquired the schools in 2017  The charity  started 25 years ago and affiliated with a Pentecostal megachurch in Los Angeles  has a nationwide network of outreach programs for problems like homelessness and domestic violence and said it planned to use the schools to fund its expansion Now its students   many with credits that cannot be easily transferred   are stuck in a meltdown  On Wednesday  members of the faculty at Argosy s Chicago and Northern Virginia campuses told students that they had been fired and instructed to remove their belongings  In Phoenix  an unpaid landlord locked students out of their classrooms  In California  a dean advised students two months away from graduation not to invite family to attend from out of town  In less than a month  everything I have worked for the past three years has been taken from me   said Jayne Kenney  who is pursuing her doctorate in clinical psychology at Argosy s Chicago campus   I am also conscious of the fact that what seems like the swift fall of an ax in less than one month has in reality been festering for years  The fall accelerated last week when the Education Department cut off federal student loan funds to Argosy after the court appointed receiver said school officials had taken about  13 million owed to students at 22 campuses and used it for expenses like payroll  The students  who had borrowed extra money to cover things like rent and groceries  were forced to use food banks or skip classes for lack of bus fare Lauren Jackson  a single mother seeking a doctorate at the Illinois School of Professional Psychology  an Argosy school in Chicago  did not receive the roughly  10 000 she was due in January  She has been paying expenses for herself and her 6 year old daughter with borrowed money and GoFundMe donations On Tuesday  after three months of not paying her rent  she received an eviction notice  I didn t want to go home and tell my baby that Mommy may not be a doctor   said Ms  Jackson  whose school could close Friday   Now I don t want to go home and tell her that we don t have a home   Bad for Everyone Led by Secretary Betsy DeVos  the Education Department has reversed an Obama era crackdown on troubled vocational and career schools and allowed new and less experienced entrants into the field Image What seems like the swift fall of an ax in less than one month has in reality been festering for years   said Jayne Kenney  a doctoral student at Argosy in Chicago CreditTaylor Glascock for The New York Times The industry was on its heels  but they ve been given new life by the department under DeVos   said Eileen Connor  the director of litigation at Harvard Law School s Project on Predatory Student Lending Ms  DeVos  who invested in companies with ties to for profit colleges before taking office  has made it an agency priority to unfetter for profit schools by eliminating restrictions on them  She also allowed several for profit schools to evade even those loosened rules by converting to nonprofits That s what Dream Center wanted to do when it asked to buy the remains of Education Management Corporation Education Management  once the nation s second largest for profit college operator  was struggling for survival after an investigation into its recruiting tactics resulted in a  200 million settlement in 2015  Despite those troubles  it had 65 000 students  and some of its schools maintained strong reputations Dream Center is connected to Angelus Temple  which was founded by Aimee Semple McPherson  a charismatic evangelist once portrayed by Faye Dunaway in a TV movie   The Disappearance of Aimee   It is affiliated with the Foursquare Church  an evangelical denomination with outposts in 146 countries Buying a chain of schools  aligns perfectly with our mission  which views education as a primary means of life transformation   Randall Barton  the foundation s managing director  said when Dream Center announced its plan But Dream Center had never run colleges  It hired a team including Brent Richardson  who worked on the conversion of Grand Canyon University to a nonprofit as its chairman  to lead the schools  corporate parent  Dream Center Education Holdings  He stepped down in January Alarms were ringing from the moment the takeover was proposed  Dream Center s effort to buy the failing ITT Technical Institutes schools had fallen apart after resistance from the Obama administration  When it asked to buy Education Management s schools  consumer groups  members of Congress and some regional accreditors raised concerns But in late 2017  Ms  DeVos s agency gave preliminary approval to Dream Center s plan Almost immediately  the organization discovered the schools were in worse shape than expected  with aging facilities and outdated technology  The universities  were  on the whole  failing without hope for redemption   the receiver wrote in a court filing last month Dream Center had anticipated a  30 million profit in its first year  Mr  Barton wrote in a recent legal filing  Instead  it was facing a  38 million loss And Dream Center showed little inclination to curb the tactics that got Education Management in trouble  like misleading students about their employment prospects  The executives it installed cultivated a high pressure culture in which profit surpassed all other concerns  according to a report filed last year by Thomas J  Perrelli  the court appointed monitor overseeing the schools  compliance with their state settlements ImageArgosy University in Chicago  Dream Center  a nonprofit that bought Argosy and other schools  anticipated a  30 million profit in its first year  Instead  it was facing a  38 million loss CreditTaylor Glascock for The New York TimesBy the end of 2018  Dream Center was facing eviction on at least nine campuses and owed creditors more than  40 million  and Education Department officials scrambled to plan for what looked like an imminent implosion  We know all too well that precipitous school closures are bad for everyone involved and leave too many students high and dry   said Liz Hill  an agency spokeswoman   Teams of people at the department have been working tirelessly on behalf of students   caught up in this situation through no fault of their own   with the singular goal in mind to ensure as many students as possible had options to complete their education  A Rapid UnravelingThe problems grew in mid January when a creditor sued Dream Center Education Holdings over unpaid bills and asked a federal court to install a receiver to wind down the insolvent organization  Within a day  a federal judge appointed Mark Dottore  who was working with Dream Center as a paid consultant  as its receiver At a forum last month with students at Argosy University in Chicago  Mr  Dottore tried to calm an anxious crowd  We will make it until June  I can pretty much assure you of that   Mr  Dottore said  according to a recording provided to The New York Times by a student   By hook or by crook  I m going to get us there  But on Wednesday  Mr  Dottore filed an emergency motion describing his plans to sell Argosy s campuses  plus the South University and Art Institute campuses that haven t been sold already  Any that didn t have a buyer by Friday would close  he said Even as Argosy campuses prepared to close  a dean at the American School of Professional Psychology in Northern Virginia emailed students on Wednesday  imploring them to attend classes the rest of the week  if we are to save the semester  Scott Peck  a 50 year old student there  left behind a six figure salary in software and cashed out his 401 k  savings to pay for his doctorate  But he feels worse for his younger classmates  What s so heartbreaking is to see what s happening to these kids in their 20s  who are believing things they re told by people that they trust   he said Argosy was supposed to pay students the extra money they had borrowed  then seek reimbursement from the government  But Argosy reported that the money was paid out even though it wasn t  Mr  Dottore wrote in court filings  and used the reimbursements for operating expenses instead A Dream Center spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment on the fraud accusation While Argosy students have little hope of getting back money they paid out of pocket  the Education Department said the federal loan debt of affected students would be forgiven for this semester  If the schools close  students can seek help under a program covering school shutdowns ImageScott Peck  50  left behind a six figure salary in software sales and consulting and cashed out his 401 k  savings to pay for his doctorate in clinical psychology at an Argosy University school CreditGreg Kahn for The New York TimesA Partial RescueNot all of the Dream Center schools are under threat of an immediate shutdown  Some were recently shunted to a new owner in a deal partly orchestrated by the Education Department But the arrangement with Studio Enterprise  a Los Angeles company that provides support services for creative industry training programs  raises its own questions  Studio is personally funded by the principals of Colbeck Capital Management  a New York private equity firm that set up the nonprofit owner Dream Center said in July that it would close more than 30 ailing campuses across all three chains  but a few months later it reached a deal with Studio to salvage some Art Institute locations As Dream Center s problems mounted in December  the Education Department called an emergency meeting  Studio agreed to coordinate an acquisition of eight Art Institute campuses and  at least temporarily  six South University campuses To maintain their nonprofit status  the agreement gave Studio the right to pick a nonprofit to buy the schools  Colbeck Capital used a Delaware based nonprofit it created five years ago  renaming it the Education Principle Foundation  according to a state filing uncovered by the Republic Report  a site that has closely tracked Dream Center s unraveling In mid January  a news release informed the 15 000 students at 14 Arts Institute and South campuses that their schools were owned by a foundation that hadn t existed three weeks earlier  Two people familiar with the foundation s plans said it intended to spin the South campuses off under their own leadership Robin Von Bokhorst  listed in legal filings as the foundation s president  did not respond to requests for comment Bryan Newman  Studio s chief executive  said the Art Institute schools had been  ignored for years   We re coming in with the view that these schools need investment   he said Consumer groups and lawmakers  however  are questioning the arrangement  Two Democrats in Congress have asked the Education Department s inspector general to investigate the department s role in the deal The fate of the schools in receivership is still being sorted out  The judge who appointed Mr  Dottore scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine if he should be removed  Creditors have complained about his close ties to Dream Center  and the judge wondered if Mr  Dottore was managing the situation in a way that did  more harm than good  Many students agree  The way they presented the receivership was that it would be beneficial to the students  but it s actually been detrimental   said Marina Awed  a student at an Argosy school in California  Western State College of Law  who was scheduled to graduate in two months   It shouldn t be this easy to defraud the Department of Education

WASHINGTON   Attacking  the secretive nature of pricing in the health care market   the Trump administration said this week that it wanted to require public disclosure of the rates that doctors and hospitals negotiate with health insurance companies  Patients have a right to price information  before they receive care  the administration said Disclosure of the wildly different prices paid by insurers for the same services in the same market would probably incite competition and  drive down health care prices   the administration said in soliciting comment on its idea The concept  set forth Monday in the Federal Register and reported by The Wall Street Journal  is not a formal proposal  but rather a first step toward a possible proposal  clearly signaling the direction in which President Trump wants to go Price transparency has been a hallmark of health policy under Mr  Trump  In a country that spends more than  3 5 trillion a year on health care  administration officials say  it is absurd that consumers cannot shop for medical goods and services as they shop for airline tickets and electronic gear  There is no more powerful force than an informed consumer   Alex M  Azar II  the secretary of health and human services  has often said  exhorting health care providers and insurers to  become more transparent about their pricing  It was not immediately clear whether the price disclosures contemplated by the White House would directly benefit consumers shopping for a knee replacement operation or the delivery of a baby at a hospital  Price transparency is desirable   Robert Weissman  the president of Public Citizen  a consumer group  said on Friday  But  he said  the disclosure requirement described by the Trump administration  won t make any difference in the experience of individual patients or for the health care system over all  What consumers want to know is what they will have to pay  and that is not the same as the reimbursement rates negotiated by doctors  hospitals and insurers  Mr  Weissman said In a similar vein  the administration has proposed requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list prices of prescription drugs they advertise on television  even though consumers often pay less  And the administration has required hospitals to post the list prices for all of their services  Consumers say the data  posted online in spreadsheets for thousands of procedures  is often incomprehensible   a hodgepodge of numbers and technical medical terms In its latest proposal  the administration asked if health care providers could be required to disclose the  negotiated rates  for all of the insurance plans with which they do business Thomas P  Nickels  an executive vice president of the American Hospital Association  said this was  a radical idea  requiring the disclosure of privately negotiated rates between two parties in a contract  Moreover  Mr  Nickels said  it would be impractical because a hospital may have contracts with a dozen insurers  and each insurer may have four or five different health plans with different terms The new initiative to require disclosure of price information came in an unusual way  slipped into the preamble to a proposed rule promoting the exchange of information stored in electronic health records  In 2009  Congress provided money to foster the adoption of electronic records  but health care providers cannot always communicate with one another when they use technology made by different vendors Economists say health care markets are opaque and frustrate consumers who want to shop for the best value Martin Gaynor  a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh  said it was possible shining sunlight on the rates paid to doctors and hospitals could put pressure on the industry to lower prices  But in some places  hospitals have market power and can raise prices without losing customers to competitors  If you are the only hospital in town  any insurer will have to have you in its network   Mr  Gaynor said   The fact that prices are public will not change that  The Trump administration said that its plan could reduce huge  inexplicable differences in prices In Minnesota  it said  insurers pay as much as  47 000 and as little as  6 200 for a total knee replacement operation  For a total hip replacement  payments have ranged from  6 700 to  44 000 Reimbursement for a typical vaginal delivery of a baby ranged from  2 900 to  12 300 in one study of Minnesota markets  while C section deliveries ranged from  4 700 to  22 800 The American Medical Association and America s Health Insurance Plans  a lobby for insurers  said they needed more information about the administration s plan before they could formulate a response A research report by securities analysts at Jefferies L L C  said the plan faced legal hurdles   Contract details between managed care organizations and health care providers are covered by confidentiality clauses  so forcing hospitals to post negotiated prices will require hard to achieve legislative action   they wrote 
WASHINGTON   The American military has escalated a battle against the Shabab  an extremist group affiliated with Al Qaeda  in Somalia even as President Trump seeks to scale back operations against similar Islamist insurgencies elsewhere in the world  from Syria and Afghanistan to West Africa A surge in American airstrikes over the last four months of 2018 pushed the annual death toll of suspected Shabab fighters in Somalia to the third record high in three years  Last year  the strikes killed 326 people in 47 disclosed attacks  Defense Department data show  For more stories about the experiences and costs of war  sign up for the weekly At War newsletter  And so far this year  the intensity is on a pace to eclipse the 2018 record  During January and February  the United States Africa Command reported killing 225 people in 24 strikes in Somalia  Double digit death tolls are becoming routine  including a bloody five day stretch in late February in which the military disclosed that it had killed 35  20 and 26 people in three separate attacks Africa Command maintains that its death toll includes only Shabab militants  even though the extremist group claims regularly that civilians are also killed  The Times could not independently verify the number of civilians killed  The rise in airstrikes has also exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in the country  according to United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations working in the region  as civilians are displaced by conflict and extreme weather  People need to pay attention to the fact that there is this massive war going on   said Brittany Brown  who worked on Somalia policy at the National Security Council in the Obama and Trump administrations and is now the chief of staff of the International Crisis Group  a nonprofit organization focused on deadly conflicts The war in Somalia appears to be  on autopilot   she added  and one that is drawing the United States significantly deeper into an armed conflict without much public debate U S  Airstrikes on the Rise in SomaliaThe United States has escalated its airstrike campaign against Qaeda backed Shabab militants in Somalia during the Trump

Long War Journal s analysis of Defense Department releases By The New York TimesSomalia  a country that occupies a key strategic location in the Horn of Africa  has faced civil war  droughts and an influx of Islamist extremists over the years  The growing United States military engagement stands in stark contrast to the near abandonment not long after the  Black Hawk Down  battle in 1993  which left 18 Americans and hundreds of militia fighters dead The intensifying bombing campaign undercuts the Trump administration s intended pivot to confront threats from great powers like China and Russia  and away from long counterinsurgency and counterterrorism campaigns that have been the Pentagon s focus since 2001 Analysts suggested that the increase in American strikes may also reflect an unspoken effort by American commanders to inflict as much punishment on the Shabab while they can  Many of our commanders probably see a renewed urgency to degrade the enemy quickly and forcefully   said Luke Hartig  a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council during the Obama administration Gen  Thomas D  Waldhauser  the head of Africa Command  said planned cutbacks elsewhere would not affect what the military is doing in Somalia  We ll maintain our capability and capacity there   General Waldhauser told the House Armed Services Committee last Thursday  Africa Command is scaling back American forces nearly everywhere else on the continent in a move that poses a particular threat for West Africa  which is grappling with a range of extremist groups The Shabab formally pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda in 2012  But long before that  they fought Western backed governments in Mogadishu as the group sought to impose its extremist interpretation of Islam across Somalia  In defending the fragile government  the United States has largely relied on proxy forces  including about 20 000 African Union peacekeepers from Uganda  Kenya and other East African nations The United States estimates that the Shabab have about 5 000 to 7 000 fighters in Somalia  but the group s ranks are fluid  A State Department official  citing interviews from Shabab deserters  said that the number of hard core ideologues may be as few as 500 There are also now roughly 500 American troops in Somalia  Most are Special Operations forces stationed at a small number of bases spread across the country  Their missions include training and advising Somali army and counterterrorism troops and conducting kill or capture raids of their own The Shabab have proved resilient against the American airstrikes  and continue to carry out regular bombings in East Africa A range of current and former American officials said no seismic strategic shift explains the increased airstrikes and higher body count  the mission remains providing security so the fledgling Somali government will have time and space to develop its own effective military and security services But they noted a range of contributing factors for the rise in tempo and lethality of the military campaign ImageGen  Thomas D  Waldhauser  the head of the military s Africa Command  testifying before Congress last Thursday  He said planned cutbacks elsewhere will not affect what the military is doing in Somalia CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesTaking a page from counterinsurgency tactics developed in Afghanistan  American forces have helped Somali soldiers build several outposts across Somalia  about 20 percent of which is still controlled by the Shabab  One is named for Staff Sgt  Alexander W  Conrad  of Chandler  Ariz   who was killed in a mortar attack last year while he helped to build it The Shabab leadership views the outposts  as an irritant  masses to go after it  but fails   Maj  Gen  Gregg Olson  the Africa Command s director of operations  said in an interview In turn  that has put attacking Shabab fighters in the cross hairs of American airstrikes to defend the Somali forces Several officials said intelligence operations   including aerial surveillance  electronic intercepts and informant networks   have improved over the past year American troops with the secretive Joint Special Operations Command have built up informant networks that lead to raids and strikes  after which they collect cellphones  laptops and documents to generate information for more The drawdown of American military operations elsewhere in the world   including in Syria and  to a lesser immediate extent  Afghanistan   also has most likely freed up more drones and other gunships for use over Somalia  several former United States officials said  We were geared up for counterterrorism efforts in Somalia  and now there are more resources to do it  so we re doing more of it   suggested Stephen Schwartz  who served as the United States ambassador to Somalia from 2016 to 2017  although he cautioned that he had no current insider knowledge  It could be there is some well thought out strategy behind all of this   Mr  Schwartz added   but I really doubt it  The loosening of Obama era constraints on using force in Somalia  as approved by President Trump in 2017  has also contributed Shortly after taking office  Mr  Trump declared Somalia to be an  area of active hostilities  subject to war zone rules  That freed the United States military to carry out offensive operations whenever Shabab militants presented themselves   including against foot soldiers without special skills or roles Mr  Trump also delegated authority to commanders to carry out strikes without high level interagency vetting  But Africa Command was initially slow to embrace it  waiting months before it carried out its first strike in 2017 under the new rules Now  however  it has opened the throttle  according to military data compiled by Bill Roggio  a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies  who has tracked counterterrorism airstrikes for more than a decade on his Long War Journal Many of the recent airstrikes have targeted large groups of suspected fighters  killing more than 10 people in a single fierce swoop  Africa Command has disclosed strikes and estimated death tolls in a series of terse news releases  earning scant attention from Congress or the news media Along with the European Union and the United Nations  the United States also has continued to invest in so called soft power assistance to Somalia  providing humanitarian aid such as food to drought victims  and development programs on education and training Officials cited signs of recent incremental progress in efforts to help the Somali government build a functional national army  And in December  the United States re established a permanent diplomatic presence in Somalia for the first time since 1991  The current United States ambassador to Somalia  Donald Yamamoto  lives in Mogadishu  although the mission consists of a windowless bunker at the well guarded airport There is good reason for caution  In 2013  Shabab militants carried out a deadly attack at the Westgate mall in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi  In January  they attacked a luxury hotel and office complex in Nairobi  killing 21 people  And in late February  the Shabab claimed a double bombing and the siege of a hotel in Mogadishu that killed at least 25 people General Olson said the military would continue to go after the Shabab as long as that is its mission  We go after the network when the network presents itself  whether a single node or a concentration   he said   We ve developed intelligence and are sussing out the relationship between the leadership and those being led  between those being led and those being trained or recruited or massed for an attack   We understand the network better than we have in years past   General Olson said 
President Trump has many bad ideas  Reconsidering America s role in NATO isn t one of them NATO  a military alliance  was formed specifically to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating Europe  whose principal powers   Germany  France  Italy and Britain   had been so devastated by World War II that they were vulnerable to Soviet coercion  subversion or conquest  NATO also became a vehicle for rehabilitating the Axis powers   Germany and Italy   under the victors  tutelage America had an enduring interest in ensuring that the Continent not fall under the domination of a single  capable  hostile power  That could pose a serious threat to America  The Truman administration was clear on this point  The main purpose of stationing American military forces in Europe in the early 1950s was to stay long enough to right the balance of power  not to stay forever By the 1960s  the balance was restored  Western Europe s economies were booming  Britain and France had become nuclear powers  German militarism had been tamed  even as a new  large modern army emerged in West Germany  During the Vietnam War  America was so free of worry about the Soviet threat that it essentially milked its conventional forces in Europe to support its war in Indochina  Its European allies contributed nothing to America s effort in Vietnam  By 1968  with the collapse of Czechoslovakia s government and army  the Soviet controlled Warsaw Pact alliance also appeared less capable In the early 1970s  Senator Mike Mansfield  a Montana Democrat  led an effort to cut the American troop presence in Europe  It lost momentum in part because the Soviet Union conducted an ill fated military buildup  which contributed to its economic failures in the 1980s  Senator Mansfield s campaign was also opposed by the Europeans  who preferred to keep their American security blanket  and by President Richard Nixon and his chief foreign affairs adviser  Henry Kissinger  who rejected what he considered congressional meddling in foreign policy  Oddly  troop reductions in Europe would have been consistent with the  Nixon Doctrine   which called explicitly for allies to do much more in their own defense The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 removed the last vestiges of a major security threat to NATO  and with it  the rationale for the American military presence in Europe  Russia s annexation of Crimea and its violent machinations in Eastern Ukraine haven t improved its ability to threaten NATO  Instead they have placed Mr  Putin in the penalty box  The European Union  like America  reacted appropriately by imposing punishing sanctions on Russia The whole misadventure has diminished Russian power  Europeans are able to defend themselves  France and Germany together equal Russia s population  enormously outweigh the country economically and outspend it militarily  But organizations don t like going out of business  and NATO was a  good brand   making it useful for other projects  So NATO took on a new goal  banishing security competition from all of Europe and its periphery  and bringing liberal democracy to former subjects of the Soviet empire  Instead of being re evaluated  NATO got bigger  NATO s expansion now requires the United States to defend all the new member states from both conventional and nuclear threats   a tall order given their proximity to Russia and a strategically unnecessary project since they can contribute nothing to American national security From an organization that could succeed simply by deterring a major military threat  NATO turned into an expansive project to make all of Western Eurasia safe  liberal and democratic   goals that are much more complicated  NATO s wars in Bosnia  Kosovo and Libya all depended on significant American military capability  none produced functioning liberal democracies  Among three of post Cold War NATO s new members   Hungary  Poland and Bulgaria   democracy is now suffering erosion or is in actual retreat  NATO s 2008 Bucharest summit declaration that Ukraine and Georgia  will become members of NATO  proved alarming to Russia   and helped pave the way to wars  In other words  NATO s well intended political project is an expensive failure Ironically  NATO also encourages fecklessness among its members in ways that can be likened to what financiers call the  moral hazard  phenomenon  in which excessive insurance  offered for an ostensibly good purpose  promotes risky behavior by those insured America s wealthy European allies have underfunded their own militaries  secure in the credibility of America s commitment  Even the most martial European powers  France and Britain  don t spend enough today to pay for their much reduced post Cold War force structures  They barely reach the alliance s obligation to spend 2 percent of G D P  on defense  France and Germany spend roughly half  and Britain two thirds  of what the United States does per soldier  unless they have achieved remarkable levels of efficiency  they must be cutting corners Germany today spends only about 1 25 percent of G D P  on defense  leaving the German armed forces a sad remnant of their very capable Cold War incarnation  Until 1990  that army could put a dozen heavily armed divisions into the field a few days after mobilization  Today it would be lucky to get one fully equipped division into the field  Less than half of German military equipment is ready for combat While European and American politicians and pundits wring their hands about the Russian military threat  European governments and militaries practice business as usual  The dysfunctional turn in European domestic politics seems to be enabled by elites who fear no foreign threats because the United States dutifully promises to take care of them Finally  NATO helps make American military action abroad too easy  The existing base structure in Europe may facilitate intervention in the greater Middle East   but the greater Middle East is another part of the world where the United States should be doing less militarily  When Washington politicians consider military action there  it would be better if they had to negotiate rather than assume access to European bases  It would force policymakers to take a bit more time to think Supporters of proposed interventions know that the American public likes the idea of having allies  NATO support helps sell an operation to voters  Europeans can applaud our action  enable our deployment to the theater and contribute small military forces to provide the patina of cost and risk sharing  The Allies did contribute troops   and suffered significant casualties   in the extended Afghan counterinsurgency  but the wars NATO enables are the Americans  to win or lose NATO s founding mission has been achieved and replaced with unsuccessful misadventures  The United States has urgent business at home  and arguably in Asia  Though President Trump has no strategy for returning the European allies to full responsibility for their own futures  the American foreign policy establishment could better spend its time devising such a strategy than defending the counterproductive trans Atlantic status quo A reappraisal is long overdue Barry R  Posen  a professor of political science at M I T  and director of its Security Studies Program  is the author  most

astronauts back to the lunar surface But in keeping with the administration s preference for the private sector  the proposal emphasizes a more commercial approach for moon exploration as it seeks budgetary reductions in other areas  It postpones a major upgrade for the giant rocket NASA is developing  and NASA s science missions could face a 10 percent reduction  including another attempt to cancel an upcoming flagship telescope  Congress has restored such cuts in earlier years While many other domestic programs face sizable cuts in the Trump administration s budget  NASA overall fares well by comparison  The budget seeks a little more than  21 billion for fiscal year 2020  which starts Oct  1  That is  1 billion more than the administration proposed for this fiscal year  but  500 million less than the  21 5 billion that Congress ultimately decided   Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar  In an address at NASA s Kennedy Space Center in Florida  Jim Bridenstine  the space agency s administrator  repeatedly described the budget as  strong  and said   We have strong bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress  President Obama had wanted NASA to focus on sending astronauts to Mars  but the Trump administration has pivoted to the moon as a closer  more immediate destination  The first element of its plan is what NASA calls the Gateway  an outpost orbiting the moon  Spacecraft would ferry astronauts between the Gateway and the lunar surface  By 2028  the Trump administration says that astronauts could return  nearly 60 years after NASA s first moon landings The Gateway is to be a collaboration between various space agencies  much like the International Space Station  Canada was the first to agree to take part  announcing last month that it would provide robotics to the lunar outpost ImageNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine  left  and Elon Musk  SpaceX s C E O   took questions after the successful Crew Dragon launch at the

moon program under President George W  Bush  the latest approach largely bankrolls a competition among private companies The budget proposal includes  363 million for development of landers for cargo and eventually astronauts  and NASA recently asked for industry input on such landers  The budget proposal did not lay out details of how the competition would be run  In future years  the financing would increase  NASA budget officials project spending  2 3 billion in 2023 To free up money for the landers  the budget postpones an upgrade of the second stage of the Space Launch System  the heavy lift rocket NASA has been developing for deep space missions  but the greater capability is not needed for the spacecraft s early missions  The budget would also shift the launching of a robotic mission to one of Jupiter s moons  the Europa Clipper  from the Space Launch System  to a cheaper commercial rocket  The proposal would start financing a new mission to Mars sometime in the late 2020s or early 2030s that would bring Martian rocks back to Earth for closer study Just like last year  the administration again seeks to cancel Wfirst  or Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope  a big astronomy mission that is to come after the much delayed James Webb Space Telescope  Congress  however  decided to continue financing for Wfirst ImageThe Orion crew module  which the Space Launch System would carry  on display at the White House in July CreditPablo Martinez Monsivais Associated PressThe administration has also eased up on trying to cut NASA s earth sciences missions  which produce data used by scientists who study climate change  The proposed budget again tries to eliminate two missions under development but sustains two others it had tried to cancel previously Mr  Bridenstine noted that the earth science budgets during the first two years of the Trump administration were well funded   That is because Congress did not go along with the administration s proposed cuts   He also spoke of the changing climate and its effects on the planet without any hedging skepticism voiced by other administration officials  Carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere in levels we ve never seen before   Mr  Bridenstine said   We are responsible for that  It is a greenhouse gas  NASA has an obligation to continue studying these activities  The budget proposal makes only passing mention of the piece of last year s budget proposal that yielded the most controversy   the phasing out of the International Space Station by the end of 2024  Instead  the document states   By 2025  the budget envisions commercial capabilities on the International Space Station as well as new commercial facilities and platforms to continue the American presence in Earth orbit  Earlier reporting

The president proposes and Congress disposes So goes the standard description of the constitutional process by which our republic is governed  Judging from the news headlines  you might think this process has not been friendly lately to the scientific community  Again and again  the Trump administration has proposed drastic cuts to the research budgets of the Department of Energy  the National Science Foundation  NASA and other agencies Quietly  however  Congress often has gone the other way and handed out increases  In February  the Congress passed  and President Trump finally signed  a spending bill for 2019  averting another government shutdown  Lost amid the collective sigh of relief and the hoopla about President Trump s wall was the news that astronomers had won a key victory  A pair of cosmically ambitious telescopes were rescued from possible oblivion One of them  the James Webb Space Telescope  NASA s long promised successor to the Hubble Space Telescope  was designed to peer deeper into space and time than any optical eyes before it  to study the earliest stars and galaxies of the cosmos  But as of last year  it was deep in the red In the 1990s  the Webb telescope was expected to cost about  800 million  But the price kept growing  threatening to suck money from NASA s other science programs  In 2011  Congress put a hard cap of  8 billion on its cost  Then an accident in 2018 at Northrop Grumman  the telescope s main contractor  added another billion to the projected cost  putting the telescope or other NASA missions in danger of being trimmed or canceled The other telescope  the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope  or Wfirst  was designed to search for exoplanets  investigate the mysterious  dark energy  apparently speeding up the expansion of the cosmos and  perhaps  elucidate the fate of the universe  But Wfirst has always lived in the Webb telescope s political and budgetary shadow Each time Webb was delayed or over budget  the dark energy mission was pushed further into the uncertain future  Many astronomers feared that the Webb s most recent cost overrun would come at the expense of Wfirst  Indeed  last year in its 2019 budget proposal  the Trump administration recommended that Wfirst be canceled outright But in the new spending bill  Congress raised the cap on Webb by  800 million  making the project whole again  for now  And Congress endorsed the Wfirst mission  with a cap of  3 2 billion on its cost  That will make things tight  since the estimated cost of the telescope recently rose to  3 6 billion  But it beats cancellation  The bipartisan support in Congress has kept the mission alive   said David Spergel  an astrophysicist at Princeton and the Flatiron Institute in Manhattan  and co chairman of the Wfirst science team  said in an email A similar theme runs through the last couple of years   Over the past two budget cycles  Congress has indeed rejected the Trump administration s proposed topline budget cuts to federal agencies that fund science   said Mitch Ambrose of the American Institute of Physics  which tracks federal spending on research Consider the final 2019 budget  Mr  Trump proposed a 5 percent cut in NASA s space science  but Congress made it an 11 percent increase  to  6 9 billion  The president wanted to cut the National Science Foundation budget by 4 percent  but Congress raised it by the same amount  to  8 1 billion Sync your calendar with the solar systemNever miss an eclipse  a meteor shower  a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that s out of this world The Geological Survey saw an even more sizable transformation  The administration proposed cutting its budget by  250 million  or about 21 percent  That would have slashed support for Climate Science Centers  which study the regional effects of climate change  and for research on carbon sequestration  Congress rejected those cuts  allotting the climate centers  25 million  only a shade less than in recent years  The Geological Survey as a whole received a one percent raise  to  1 2 billion Even the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  with its politically sensitive mission to study climate and weather  received a 3 percent increase  worth  16 million  to its  566 million budget for science for 2019  The Trump administration had proposed a 41 percent cut   a potentially devastating blow to the agency  By comparison  the president s border wall would cost about  5 7 billion  Though this administration has regrettably chosen to ignore the findings of its own scientists in regards to climate change  we as lawmakers have a responsibility to protect the public s interest   Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson  a Democrat from Texas  said in a recent meeting of the House Science Committee  which she now heads Lamar Alexander  the Republican chairman of the Senate s Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies  expressed the same sentiment last spring in a statement to his committee  Over the last three years  Congress has developed quite a consensus on science and research   he said  noting in particular its agreement on medical research and supercomputing   I would tell President Trump and the Office of Management and Budget that science  research and innovation is what made America first  and I recommend that he add science research and innovation to his  America First  agenda  Not all is rosy in the realms of science policy  Since 1997  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been discouraged from studying guns and violence by the so called Dickey Amendment  which prohibits the C D C  from promoting gun control  Last year Congress affirmed that the C D C  could study the causes of gun violence  but provided no money for such research In an email  Julie Eschelbach  spokeswoman for the agency said   Although C D C  does not receive direct funding for firearm related research  C D C  has and continues to support data collection activities and analyses to document the public health burden of firearm injuries in the U S  And 86 percent of Americans  a majority of both Democrats and Republicans  favor spending more money on science  according to a recent poll by Hart Research and Echelon Insights Once upon a time   in Einstein s day  for example   it might have been considered unseemly for scientists to step outside their laboratories and make their case to the public  Today  organizations such as the American Astronomical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have programs that teach young scientists how to do just that That work is unlikely ever to be finished  Mr  Trump on Monday began unveiling his 2020 budget  and the cycle of cuts  cancellation and rescue may repeat itself again  Indeed  his new budget proposes to cancel Wfirst as well as a pair of missions devoted to studying Earth s climate  atmosphere and oceans  Scientists are going to have to work hard to make new friends in Congress   wrote Matt Mountain  former director of the Space Telescope Science Institute  which runs the Hubble and will run the Webb telescope  and president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy  in an email More practice in the art of the possible  Dr  Mountain said   more stuff they never taught us at graduate school  
WASHINGTON   If you re on federal disability payments and on social media  be careful what you post  Uncle Sam wants to watch The Trump administration has been quietly working on a proposal to use social media like Facebook and Twitter to help identify people who claim Social Security disability benefits without actually being disabled  If  for example  a person claimed benefits because of a back injury but was shown playing golf in a photograph posted on Facebook  that could be used as evidence that the injury was not disabling  There is a little bitty chance that Social Security may be snooping on your Facebook or your Twitter account   Robert A  Crowe  a lawyer from St  Louis who has represented Social Security disability claimants for more than 40 years  said he cautioned new clients   You don t want anything on there that shows you out playing Frisbee  In its budget request to Congress last year  Social Security said it would study whether to expand the use of social media networks in disability determinations as a way to  increase program integrity and expedite the identification of fraud  Since then  administration officials said  the White House has been actively working with Social Security to flesh out the proposal  in the belief that social media could be a treasure trove of information about people who are applying for or receiving disability benefits Some members of Congress  like Senator James Lankford  Republican of Oklahoma  and some conservative organizations  like the Heritage Foundation in Washington  have supported the idea as part of a broader effort to prevent the payment of disability benefits to people who are able to work But advocates for people with disabilities say the use of social media in this way would be dangerous because photos posted there do not always provide reliable evidence of a person s current condition  It may be difficult to tell when a photograph was taken   said Lisa D  Ekman  a lawyer who is the chairwoman of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities  a coalition of advocacy groups   Just because someone posted a photograph of them golfing or going fishing in February of 2019 does not mean that the activity occurred in 2019  Moreover  people are more likely to post pictures of themselves when they are happy and healthy than when they are in a wheelchair or a hospital bed More than 10 million people receive Social Security disability insurance benefits totaling more than  11 billion a month  Beneficiaries have paid into the system through payroll taxes President Trump is expected to detail several proposals to combat fraud in the program in his 2020 budget  to be issued on Monday Before he was an official presidential candidate  Mr  Trump said he would not cut Social Security When he announced his candidacy in June 2015  Mr  Trump maintained that position   Save Medicare  Medicaid and Social Security without cuts  Have to do it  Get rid of the fraud  Get rid of the waste and abuse  but save it  But his budgets in the last two years have proposed reductions in the disability insurance program  which has been part of Social Security since 1956 The president s budget director  Mick Mulvaney  who is now also the acting White House chief of staff  has suggested that Mr  Trump s campaign commitment does not cover disability benefits  Do you really think that Social Security disability insurance is part of what people think of when they think of Social Security   Mr  Mulvaney asked on CBS s  Face the Nation  in 2017   I don t think so  It s the fastest growing program  It was   it grew tremendously under President Obama  It s a very wasteful program  and we want to try and fix that  Brian C  Blase  a special assistant to the president for economic policy  has been coordinating development of the new proposals on Social Security  In 2014  Mr  Blase provided the staff work for a subcommittee investigation of the disability program led by Mr  Lankford  who was then a member of the House  Soon after he got to the Senate  Mr  Lankford proposed legislation to expand the use of  evidence obtained from publicly available social media  ImageMick Mulvaney  President Trump s acting chief of staff and budget director  has suggested that most people do not think of disability insurance as part of Social Security CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesAt present  disability examiners do not routinely look at social media  They can refer suspicious cases to the inspector general for Social Security  who may use social media to corroborate information from other sources in fraud investigations conducted with state and local law enforcement agencies The Trump administration contends that it could authorize greater use of social media by regulation  without action by Congress  Under pressure from the White House  Social Security has drafted a timeline that envisions publication of a final rule in the spring of 2020 Michael J  Astrue  the last Senate confirmed Social Security commissioner  has expressed misgivings about the idea  Social media sites are not exactly clear and reliable evidence   Mr  Astrue  who stepped down six years ago  said at a Senate hearing in 2012   Facebook puts up phony websites under my name all the time  That  he said  is  why you need professionally trained fraud investigators  to evaluate the information Few would say that the Social Security disability program was free of fraud  The government has secured guilty pleas from a number of people who concealed the fact that they were working in various industries while drawing Social Security disability benefits In one case  a 57 year old Louisiana man pleaded guilty last month to theft of government funds  He had received  2 177 a month in benefits   a total of  242 000   while employed by companies that did demolition work and job site cleaning  He also operated heavy construction equipment  He told federal investigators that the companies had been registered in the names of family members  rather than his own name   so y all wouldn t find out about it   according to court records In its latest financial report  Social Security estimated that it made  3 4 billion in overpayments to disability insurance beneficiaries in 2017  in part because of their failure to report work activities The program has been  riddled with problems  including fraud and abuse   said Rachel Greszler  a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation  When people who can work collect benefits  she said   it drains the system for those who truly cannot work and support themselves  The administration s focus on fraud comes as the number of Americans seeking Social Security disability benefits is plunging  The number of applications was down 29 percent last year from a peak of 2 9 million in 2010 A growing economy with strong demand for workers is one reason for the decline  officials say  In addition  they speculate that with new technology and the potential for teleworking  it is possible for some people to take jobs even though they have medical conditions that would have precluded work in the past Social Security officials are considering other changes that could make it more difficult for people to qualify for benefits They are working with the White House to overhaul the way Social Security weighs various  vocational factors    age  education and job experience   in deciding whether a person is able to work In November  Social Security proposed a new rule that would strip applicants and beneficiaries of their right to an in person hearing before an administrative law judge  after some judges came under scrutiny for leniency in allowing disability claims  In 2017  a former administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration pleaded guilty for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain more than  550 million in federal disability payments for thousands of claimants Under the November proposal  Social Security could hold the hearings by video conference even if a claimant objected  With video conferencing  the agency said  it could improve service to the public and reduce wait times  At present  it said  nearly 860 000 people are waiting an average of 19 months for hearings to appeal the denial or termination of benefits But top Democrats responsible for Social Security policy in Congress denounced the proposal in a letter to the acting Social Security commissioner  Nancy A  Berryhill  This change would deprive millions of Americans of their constitutional right to due process and result in hearings which are less fair and less efficient   said the letter  signed by Representative Richard E  Neal of Massachusetts  the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee  and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee  among others 
WASHINGTON   Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced Monday that she will no longer enforce a provision in federal law that bars religious organizations from providing federally funded educational services to private schools The move comes after the 2017 Supreme Court decision  Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia Inc  v  Comer  in which the high court found that Missouri had unconstitutionally engaged in religious discrimination when it denied a church run preschool publicly funded tire scraps for its playground Ms  DeVos said that after consultation with the Justice Department  education officials determined that a provision in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  the federal law governing the nation s elementary  middle and high schools  was also unconstitutional  The law calls for students in public and private schools to receive  equitable services   such as special education  tutoring or mentoring  and allows districts to hire contractors to deliver those services  But the law requires that those contractors be independent of  any religious organization   The Trinity Lutheran decision reaffirmed the long understood intent of the First Amendment to not restrict the free exercise of religion   Ms  DeVos said in a statement   Those seeking to provide high quality educational services to students and teachers should not be discriminated against simply based on the religious character of their organization  The Education Department said it would continue to enforce other provisions of the law that require contractors to be independent of a private school and that the services they provide be  secular  neutral and nonideological  Ms  DeVos sent a letter on Monday to Speaker Nancy Pelosi  the California Democrat  and several other congressional leaders outlining her decision Democrats said they were reviewing whether the move by Ms  DeVos was legal  House Democrats are carefully reviewing the legality of the administration s new policy   said Joshua Weisz  a spokesman for the House Education Committee Ms  DeVos  who made her announcement at a gathering of state officials for the Council for American Private Education  has signaled that she plans to scrutinize religious restrictions embedded in federal law in light of the Trinity decision  When the decision was announced  she said   we should all celebrate the fact that programs designed to help students will no longer be discriminated against by the government based solely on religious affiliation  Last May  the department announced that it would look to loosen federal regulations on religious colleges and universities in light of the court ruling  And in a speech last spring  Ms  DeVos anticipated that the decision would lead to the demise of state prohibitions called  Blaine Amendments  that prevent taxpayer funding from going to parochial education organizations that provide a public service The Trump administration has made extending protections to religious organizations a priority  Two years ago  the attorney general at the time  Jeff Sessions  issued guidance to all agency heads asserting that laws  must not discriminate against religious organizations in their contracting or grant making activities   Except in the narrowest circumstances  no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law   Mr  Sessions wrote   Therefore  to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law  religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government activity  including employment  contracting and programming  
BEIJING   A pending trade agreement between the United States and China could put few restrictions on Beijing s control over the strength of its currency  potentially inflaming trade hawks in Congress and within the Trump administration itself China s control over the value of its currency has long been a major point of conflict between Beijing and the West  though the issue has faded in prominence in recent years  Lawmakers and officials in other countries have contended that Beijing has unfairly weakened China s currency  the renminbi  compared with the American dollar and other currencies  giving Chinese companies and factories an advantage when selling goods abroad China has long denied the accusation Yi Gang  the governor of China s central bank  said at a news conference on Sunday morning in Beijing that during high level trade talks last month in Washington   the two sides reached consensus on many key and important issues  about currency markets The consensus included an understanding that both countries would avoid devaluing their currencies to achieve a competitive advantage for their exports  Mr  Yi said  Both countries would also continue to comply with previous currency agreements among the Group of 20 economies  he said  Both countries would also maintain close communication about currency markets and would disclose detailed information in accordance with International Monetary Fund standards  he added American officials have taken varying stances on the currency provisions  President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have expressed satisfaction with them  But Robert E  Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  cautioned Congress in testimony two weeks ago that nothing was fully resolved in the trade negotiations until everything had been settled Though the issue has ebbed as China s currency has strengthened in recent years  the trade war has given it new relevance  The renminbi fell 10 percent against the American dollar between February and October last year  to the intense annoyance of trade hawks in the Trump administration In effect  that partly offset the 25 percent tariffs the Trump administration imposed over the summer on  50 billion a year in Chinese goods  It fully offset  at least temporarily  the 10 percent tariffs that Mr  Trump imposed last fall on an additional  200 billion a year in Chinese goods But the renminbi s fall corresponded to a credit crunch in China and the precipitous slowing of the Chinese economy  Chinese officials contend that the renminbi s fall reflected the strength of the dollar  not currency manipulation on their part  Miao Yanliang  the chief economist at the Chinese central bank  the People s Bank of China  noted in a recent statement that the euro fell against the dollar at about the same pace as the renminbi from February to October last year  while the British pound fell even faster Since the end of October  the renminbi has recovered nearly half its losses during last year s slide  Foreign investors have poured money into China s stock market and bond market  They hope to profit from China s recent program of extra government spending and tax cuts  now being enacted to offset the economic slowdown The currency provisions of the evolving trade agreement are essentially a reaffirmation of the statement that the G 20 economies  including China  issued when the group s finance ministers gathered in Shanghai in February 2016 In the Shanghai currency accord  all the group s finance ministers agreed that they would not deliberately devalue their currencies with the purpose of achieving a competitive advantage for their exports  When a country s currency falls in value  that makes the country s exports less expensive and more competitive in foreign countries But the Shanghai currency accord  like the currency provisions in the Sino American trade agreement now being negotiated  still allowed currencies to move up and down for lots of other reasons  These reasons include differences in interest rates and varying investment flows  as well as trade surpluses and deficits China has long contended that these variables determine what happens to the value of its currency  and that it does not deliberately undervalue its currency to help exporters The Shanghai currency accord did not require China to peg its currency at a specific value with respect to the dollar  Nor did it require China to maintain stability in the value of its currency with respect to a weighted average of the currencies of China s trading partners Beijing argues that it is fairer to measure the renminbi s value against a so called basket of currencies of its trading partners  and not just against the dollar The Shanghai currency accord also required G 20 finance ministers to notify each other of major changes in currency policy  and to disclose data in compliance with I M F  standards In August 2015  China unexpectedly devalued its currency with no warning and very little explanation  It then quietly let the currency slide further from December 2015 through early January 2016 Japan had pushed hard for the Shanghai accord because of Japanese exporters  alarm over the Chinese devaluation That devaluation helped China s exporters a little  but it came at a very high cost to Beijing  Once the renminbi started sliding  it proved very hard to stop  The central bank ended up spending  1 trillion of its  4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves to stabilize the currency Mr  Yi said on Sunday that the central bank now had a target of maintaining foreign exchange reserves of at least  3 trillion  The reserves have fluctuated at about that level for the past three years and totaled  3 09 trillion in February That leaves very little room for the Chinese central bank to intervene again in currency markets without falling below the threshold set by Mr  Yi The accusation by American officials that China manipulates its currency is based on a period from early 2001 to the summer of 2014 when the Chinese central bank did sell renminbi and buy dollars on a massive scale to keep the renminbi weak and help exporters China s foreign reserves ballooned 24 fold in that period  rising to  4 trillion from  166 billion and dwarfing every other country s reserves But since then  Chinese officials have struggled to prevent the renminbi from falling  As the Chinese economy has slowed  many Chinese companies and families have looked for ways to send money out of the country  potentially destabilizing not just the renminbi  but also the Chinese financial system Beijing has responded since 2016 with increasingly draconian restrictions on capital movements  Using the formidable investigative and surveillance capabilities of the Chinese police  the government has jailed people involved in surreptitious movements of cash abroad The crackdown has almost completely halted what had been a flood of Chinese money into American real estate and even European soccer clubs in 2015 and early 2016  China now approves few overseas acquisitions by its companies except in areas where it could acquire a geopolitical or military advantage  such as aircraft production  heavy manufacturing  cybersecurity and artificial intelligence Mr  Yi spoke on Sunday at the annual news conference of the central bank s leadership  held in conjunction with the 11 day session of the National People s Congress

shrivel  few Americans were in a position to take a fresh flier on beaten down stocks     Even those who are invested are behaving differently  both in how they invest and what they re doing with the

What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  The authorities were conducting a routine inspection aboard the M S C  Carlotta last month when a worn  teal shipping container caught their eye  The pins that held the containers  doors in place appeared to have been doctored The Carlotta  a container ship  had just arrived in Newark from Buenaventura  Colombia  and the teal container was supposed to contain dried fruit  Instead  officers opened the doors to find something that stunned even the most experienced customs agents  60 tightly wrapped bundles of white powder  each the size of a small trunk The bundles turned out to be 3 200 pounds of cocaine  the largest drug shipment to be intercepted at Port Newark in a quarter century  a bounty worth  77 million on the street  the authorities said on Monday The discovery of the shipment underscored the reality that legal ports of entry  remain the main channel through which illicit drugs flow  even though President Trump has contended that drugs are pouring over the unsecured sections of the southern border to justify building a barrier there The seizure on Feb  28 also suggested the city s market for cocaine was resurging  officials said  after several years during which heroin and fentanyl  a powerful synthetic opioid  had dominated New York s illicit drug scene Ray Donovan  the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration office in New York City  said dealers have begun combining fentanyl with cocaine  creating a new and deadly product  He said the giant cocaine shipment was a sign that traffickers were pushing  to build an emerging customer base of users mixing cocaine and fentanyl   This record breaking seizure draws attention to this new threat and shows law enforcement s collaborative efforts in seizing illicit drugs before it gets to the streets and into users  hands   he said Investigators from the Department of Homeland Security were trying to determine where the drugs came from  and how they ended up in Newark  The authorities said on Monday that no arrests had been made The operation included officers from Customs and Border Protection  the D E A  and the New York Police Department  The port in Newark is one of the country s largest and is a hub for illicit drugs from China and Mexico to enter the United States Cocaine has taken a back seat in recent years to opioids like heroin and fentanyl  officials said  Heroin is often cut with fentanyl to make it more potent  a trend that has caused an increase in overdose deaths Recent months  though  have seen the same tactics being used to cut and increase the city s cocaine supply  It has concerned authorities enough that Mr  Donovan issued a public warning late last year to residents and tourists saying New York s cocaine supply may be laced with fentanyl 
For months  Juan Sanchez was at the center of the national uproar over family separations at the Mexican border because the nonprofit he founded  Southwest Key Programs  was housing migrant children taken from their parents  On Monday  facing intense scrutiny from his own organization and federal investigations over alleged financial improprieties  he stepped down after 32 years at the helm The charity s chief financial officer  Melody Chung  left last month after a New York Times article outlined allegations of mismanagement and possible malfeasance at the charity Southwest Key began an internal investigation after the article was published in December  The Justice Department also started investigating The Southwest Key shelter in a former Walmart superstore in Brownsville  Tex   known as Casa Padre  became a symbol of the Trump administration s family separation policy  with immigration advocates likening it to a warehouse for children  But it was also a generator of millions of dollars in federal grants at a nonprofit unusually concerned with its bottom line From its humble beginnings in Brownsville  the charity became the largest player in the shelter system for unaccompanied minors nationwide  In the last decade  Southwest Key was awarded almost  1 8 billion in federal money to care for those children  The nonprofit can house up to 5 000 children in its 24 shelters in Texas  Arizona and California  including the former Walmart Mr  Sanchez earned  1 5 million in 2017  the most recent tax return available  His wife earned  500 000  His daughter from a previous marriage also held a senior position  but her salary was not available  Ms  Chung earned  1 million But the modern day Horatio Alger tale of a shoeshine boy and Golden Gloves boxer turned Harvard doctorate and nonprofit chief executive came to an end with Southwest Key s announcement of Mr  Sanchez s departure The Southwest Key board  in consultation with Mr  Sanchez  decided it was time to begin a new chapter at the charity  Orlando Martinez  the board chairman  said in a statement   Our mission has never been more critical than it is today  and we must look carefully at what is required to evolve and grow as an organization   he said  This was a very difficult decision   Mr  Sanchez wrote in an email to employees that was obtained by The Times   Recent events have convinced me and our Board of Directors that Southwest Key would benefit from a fresh perspective and new leadership  Widespread misunderstanding of our business and unfair criticism of our people have become a distraction our employees do not deserve  and I can no longer bear  Mr  Sanchez s wife  Jennifer Nelson  remains as a top executive Mr  Sanchez s resignation came amid questions from The Times about Southwest Key s handling of charter schools spun off from the organization  Mr  Sanchez serves on the school board  It is unclear whether his resignation will change that As of February  there were more than 11 000 minors in the shelter system  housed in about 100 sites  As the number of unaccompanied migrant children continued to pose a crisis  Mr  Sanchez had been central to the administration s plans Southwest Key  which was sitting on  61 million in cash in the fall of 2017  also lent millions of dollars to real estate developers  acting more like a bank than a traditional charity  It has rented shelters rather than buying them  an unusual practice that has proved lucrative for shelter owners  including Mr  Sanchez and Ms  Chung  The Times reported in December Mr  Sanchez  Ms  Chung and a friend owned a shelter in Conroe  Tex   through a shell company  Asked by The Times last year about that potential self dealing   whereby the executives collected rent paid by the federal government   they announced that they would seek to sell their ownership stakes  There is no record that the property has yet been sold A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services  which oversees migrant shelter grants  said late last year that the government had hired forensic accountants to review the finances of shelter operators  including Southwest Key Joella L  Brooks  a longtime Southwest Key employee and the current chief operating officer  was named interim chief executive  Mr  Sanchez said that a  nationwide search  would begin for a permanent replacement  I m grateful for the opportunity to continue serving our dedicated employees and youth in need   Ms  Brooks  who joined the organization almost 30 years ago  said in a statement In 1987  Mr  Sanchez  who had grown up poor near the Mexican border  used his mother s address in Brownsville on founding documents for the nonprofit  The charity took out loans of  6 700 to buy a photocopier and a computer  Mr  Sanchez s salary at the time was a modest  35 000 While its initial business was in juvenile justice  it was in the housing of unaccompanied migrant children that its revenues exploded  Ms  Chung noted in her resignation letter to staff that when she started working at Southwest Key 20 years ago  the nonprofit had roughly 500 employees and gross revenue of  16 million  By the time she resigned  those numbers had grown to 8 000 employees and gross revenue of more than  400 million Ms  Chung closed her resignation letter last month   May the Lord continue to bless the company abundantly forever  
ALBUQUERQUE   New Mexico s governor is feuding with county sheriffs  accusing them of going  rogue  by refusing to enforce new gun control legislation  Counties in Oregon are passing militia backed measures against stricter gun laws  Washington State is warning sheriffs they could face legal action if they don t run enhanced background checks approved by voters As states have approved dozens of restrictive gun control measures since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Fla   last year  efforts to resist such laws have gathered strength around the nation as rural gun owners say their rights are being violated  This is just a gun grab measure   Shane Ferrari  the sheriff of San Juan County  said of a provision that requires background checks on most gun sales in New Mexico  signed into law this month by Gov  Michelle Lujan Grisham  a Democrat Sheriff Ferrari  a Republican  said he believed that the new law was a violation of the Second Amendment and the state s existing gun laws  and that he would not enforce it unless a court ruling told him to do so  And all but a handful of counties in New Mexico have expressed similar opposition The impasses   between local sheriffs and elected officials in states now controlled by Democrats   are raising the specter of a constitutional showdown over enforcement of the new gun laws  Some of the gun rights advocates say they are simply drawing inspiration from strategies employed by liberal critics of the Trump administration  They compare their efforts to declare  Second Amendment sanctuary  counties to so called sanctuary cities opposing the federal government s immigration crackdown  Critics are calling these new laws Gestapo style tactics when that s the furthest thing from the truth   said Victor Snover  the mayor of Aztec  a town in San Juan County that was shaken by a school shooting in 2017 in which a former student killed two students and himself Mr  Snover  a Democrat who is also a teacher at Aztec High School  called the measure  common sense and reasonable   He added   But unfortunately we live in a hyperpartisan time when avoiding tragedies isn t viewed as reasonable  In New Mexico and elsewhere  the disputes generally reflect tension between cities that support stricter gun laws and rural areas that want to bolster protections for gun owners  The pushback against new laws generally seeks to maintain existing gun ownership rights  most have not yet been challenged in court The disputes around the country over the gun control measures raise vexing questions about the rule of law  Governors claim that local sheriffs cannot pick which laws to enforce  but some states have already grappled with low compliance with other gun laws  There s a real tension on this issue between urban and rural identities that doesn t necessarily fit nicely into party loyalties   said Lonna Atkeson  a political science professor at the University of New Mexico  She noted that some of the counties vehemently opposing the state s new gun control legislation are solidly Democratic Elsewhere  dozens of counties in Illinois have approved  gun sanctuary  resolutions meant to signal local discontent with gun control measures approved by the State Legislature  which is dominated by Democrats ImageBob Ferguson  the attorney general of Washington State  has warned sheriffs that they have a legal responsibility to enforce the state s weapons law CreditTed S  Warren Associated PressAmong the measures approved by Illinois last year was one requiring a 72 hour waiting period for all gun purchases and a so called red flag bill  which allows relatives and law enforcement officials to ask courts to confiscate firearms from people deemed a threat to themselves or others In Oregon  where the State Legislature is currently debating several gun control measures   including a bill that would forbid the sale of assault rifles to people under 21   voters in eight counties have approved ordinances stating that residents have the right to own semiautomatic weapons and high capacity magazines  even if federal and state law bans them Some of the most public discontent  however  has come in Washington  where a divide between rural and urban areas has become a recurring political split In November  nearly 60 percent of Washington State voters approved an initiative prohibiting anyone under 21 from purchasing a semiautomatic rifle and requiring buyers to undergo enhanced background checks   State law already barred those under 21 from buying a handgun   Long guns that employ manual operations  including pumps and bolts  could still be purchased at age 18 The law also mandated a 10 day waiting period and completion of a firearms training course  The initiative also allowed prosecutors to charge gun owners with crimes if the gun was stored improperly and someone unable to legally own a gun used it to commit a crime Most of the law is scheduled to take effect July 1  though the Second Amendment Foundation  a nonprofit group based in Washington State that supports gun rights  has filed a lawsuit seeking to block it Already  though  more than a dozen sheriffs in Washington have said they will refuse to enforce the law That has set up a showdown between them and Bob Ferguson  the attorney general Mr  Ferguson has warned the sheriffs that they have a legal responsibility to enforce the new law in the same manner they are sworn to uphold other laws prohibiting criminal activity  Local law enforcement officials are entitled to their opinions about the constitutionality of any law  but those personal views do not absolve us of our duty to enforce Washington laws and protect the public   Mr  Ferguson wrote in a letter last month But Bob Songer  the sheriff of Klickitat County  a rural county in southern Washington  said that the law violated gun owners  rights  There is no way in hell I m going to be going after their guns if they are honest citizens   he said   What I ve told people is  I m not giving up my guns  and I don t expect them to give up theirs  The sheriff dismissed the pressure from the state s attorney general to abide by the law  They are not the boss of the sheriff   he said   The only bosses I have are the voters of Klickitat County

Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   The Trump administration on Friday finalized its plan to loosen Obama era protections on the habitat of the sage grouse  an imperiled ground nesting bird that roams across 10 oil rich Western states The plan  which would strip away protections for the bird on nearly nine million acres of land in the West   making it easier for oil and gas companies to drill on that land   was first detailed in a draft proposal published in December  The sage grouse plan is the latest step in a series of moves by the Trump administration to promote oil and gas drilling on public land  in support of what President Trump has called a policy of American  energy dominance   The architect of the plan  David Bernhardt  is a former oil lobbyist who now serves as acting head of the Interior Department Mr  Trump has nominated Mr  Bernhardt to formally assume the position of interior secretary   The plans adopted today show that listening to and working with our neighbors at the state and local levels of government is the key to long term conservation and to ensuring the viability of local communities across the West   Mr  Bernhardt said in a statement on Friday Environmentalists criticized the plan as a giveaway to the oil and gas industry that would devastate the nesting habitat of the bird  By punching oil rig sized loopholes through these plans  the administration will drive the sage grouse closer to an endangered species listing   said Jesse Prentice Dunn  policy director for the Center for Western Priorities  an advocacy group   Unfortunately for the grouse  Bernhardt is also leading a charge to gut the Endangered Species Act  Mr  Bernhardt has led an effort to overhaul the 1973 law  which was designed to protect the nation s wildlife  He has pushed for changes such as requiring the federal government to take into account the economic impact of placing a species on the endangered species list  Currently  the law only requires that regulators take into account the scientific evidence showing whether a species is threatened Under a sage grouse plan put forth in 2015  during the administration of former President Barack Obama  oil and gas drilling was banned or limited in 10 7 million acres where the bird lives  under a stringent designation known as  sagebrush focal areas   The new plan would limit that designation to all but 1 8 million acres  mostly in Oregon and Montana Gov  Kate Brown of Oregon  a Democrat  offered praise for the protections in her state afforded by the Trump administration s plan  Balancing sage grouse habitat protection and economic development requires mitigation of negative impacts   she said   This agreement is a critical step that marks a shift away from planning toward active conservation and landscape management to protect this iconic species  Oregon s bounty is beautiful and worth continuing to protect and fight for  More reporting on the sage grouse and endangered species actTrump Drilling Plan Threatens 9 Million Acres of Sage Grouse HabitatDec  6  2018Lawmakers  Lobbyists and the Administration Join Forces to Overhaul the Endangered Species ActJuly 22  2018Law That Saved the Bald Eagle Could Be Vastly ReworkedJuly 19  2018Interior Department to Overhaul Obama s Sage Grouse Protection PlanSept  28  2017For more news on climate and the environment  follow  NYTClimate on Twitter 
AVONDALE  Ariz    A hotel groundbreaking ceremony here in an old cotton field not far from Interstate 10 last month featured two United States senators  a hot catered lunch and a stream of speeches about driving economic investment to this corner of the Southwest that is still recovering from the Great Recession Whether they were celebrating the beginnings of a wave of investment in distressed parts of America  or just another Marriott property  could hinge on a coming decision by the Trump administration A new batch of tax regulations from the Treasury Department will establish the most comprehensive guidelines yet for what sorts of investments qualify for tax benefits associated with opportunity zones  which were created by the 2017 tax law  and how investors must proceed in order to take advantage of them Potentially billions of dollars are waiting on the Treasury s decision  Civic leaders in areas like Avondale  which is still hurting from the 2008 housing crisis  are hoping the rules will be broad enough to improve the odds of attracting new businesses that offer well paying jobs to residents  Investors  eager to put money into the tax advantaged opportunity zones  are also clamoring for guidelines that could determine the types of projects they can back Among the money dependent on the Trump administration s rules is  22 million in investment guarantees  to be announced Monday by the Kresge Foundation  to support two socially conscious investment funds that hope to pour  800 million into manufacturing  clean energy and other business development in Opportunity Zones The zones are a creation of President Trump s signature tax law that use tax advantages to lure capital to economically lagging cities  suburbs and rural areas  So far  they have stirred growing investor interest  including from Wall Street  and criticism from some tax experts who worry they will serve mostly as a handout to the rich Most of the projects spurred so far by the zone designations are real estate  like condominium developments  or hospitality  like the SpringHill Suites by Marriott project started here in Phoenix s west suburbs by a private equity group called Virtua Partners Whether the zones can ultimately spur other types of investment  like small businesses and start up technology companies  will depend on how the rules are structured  Treasury officials have sent the White House a draft version of what will be the second batch of regulations governing so called opportunity funds  which invest in Opportunity Zones  and what types of investments can qualify for the special tax treatment The tax break works by allowing investors to roll capital gains from other investments into the funds  Taxes on those original gains are deferred and  if the investment is held for several years  can be sharply reduced  Adding to the attraction is the potential for investors who hold their money in the opportunity fund for a full decade to be exempt from any capital gains taxes on that investment Conflict over the regulations reflects  in part  a tension among officials concerned most with limiting the potential for investors to exploit loopholes in the program in order to reduce their tax bills  and those most concerned with maximizing investment in struggling parts of America In the first batch of regulations  Treasury officials took a more restrictive approach  according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information request  But those were ultimately overruled by the White House  which prevailed on several points that investors had championed  those records show A recent Internal Revenue Service hearing on what will be the second batch of regulations was dominated by investors and civic leaders requesting changes and additions to the rules in several areas that could deter investment in start up companies Those include a provision that currently requires qualifying businesses to earn 50 percent of their income inside the zones  which would seem to limit businesses that make money by exporting goods or selling them online  Investors are also seeking flexibility to sell their stake in a business before the end of a decade and use the proceeds to invest elsewhere in an opportunity zone Investors also want to clarify a rule that forces them to  substantially improve  an asset in order to qualify for the tax benefit  to ensure that biotech  software and other start ups that deal largely with intellectual property can meet the test  The second tranche of regulations is a moment of truth for investors and communities   said John Lettieri  the president of the Economic Innovation Group think tank  who was an architect of the Opportunity Zone concept  The difference in potential investment in the zones between favorable and unfavorable regulations  he said   is orders of magnitude  While investors wait for clarity  the existing regulations have  frozen some of the market for business investment   said Steve Glickman  another architect of the concept who now runs an Opportunity Zone related consulting business called Develop L L C   and who has produced an Opportunity Zone Index to help investors find and select promising zones for projects The Kresge guarantees  for example  are meant to help two funds   run by Arctaris in Boston and Community Capital Management in Fort Lauderdale  Fla    deploy  800 million into Opportunity Zone projects like solar farm development in Flint  Mich  In exchange  the funds are committing to a set of rules that would require them to invest in creating living wage jobs  form community advisory boards and seek to avoid displacing residents from those zones  They will also compile and share data on the quality and impact of their investments  which is not currently required by the federal government But they are dependent on the outcome of the regulations  and whether they will encourage business projects   These are practical concerns for us   said Aaron Seybert  a social investment officer at Kresge   We need to quantify the risk that we re taking  The existing regulations have made that calculation relatively easy for real estate investors  who are accelerating previously planned projects in the zones and starting new ones that might not have worked without the special tax treatment  That activity has already paid off for incumbent landowners in Opportunity Zones  according to research by the real estate firm Zillow  Average sales prices in the zones jumped 25 percent last fall  compared with the year before City officials welcomed the new hotel to Avondale  a majority Hispanic city of 84 000 people that is still recovering from the burst housing bubble a decade ago  At one point  40 percent of the city s homeowners were underwater on their mortgage or had fallen into foreclosure Conditions have improved  slowly  and developers have added 200 000 square feet of new retail space in the last five years  city officials said  But Kenn Weise  the mayor  said the city still needed help   and real estate development won t do it alone The city  Mr  Weise said  needs to revitalize its historic downtown  which has fallen on hard times  and it needs businesses to employ the more than 80 percent of workers who live here but endure long commutes to other parts of the metro area  where the jobs are  This part of it is easy   Mr  Weise said under the shade of a white tent here recently  gesturing toward the row of shovels that were about to break ground on what will be the latest in a recent string of new hotels near the freeway in and around Avondale   This is the low hanging fruit  The more far flung dignitaries gathered for the ceremony made similar points  even as they praised Virtua and Hotel Equities  the company that will manage the new hotel   At the end of the day  real estate development is a very important step forward   Senator Tim Scott  Republican of South Carolina and the

WASHINGTON   The United States and China are pushing for a summit meeting in late April to complete a trade deal  while negotiators are still grappling over its terms and how they should be enforced Although much remains unsettled  one thing is becoming clear  The Trump administration will continue to hold the threat of tariffs over Beijing to ensure that it lives up to whatever commitments it agrees to in the final deal  That approach is prompting concern among American businesses that the economic damage and uncertainty caused by President Trump s trade war could persist even once negotiations are resolved On Friday  a report commissioned by the nation s biggest business lobbying group showed that the Trump administration s tariffs are actually damaging an industry the levies were intended to protect  The report  by the U S  Chamber of Commerce and the Rhodium Group  a research firm  said that Mr  Trump s tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods were eroding the competitiveness of the America information technology sector   including companies that manufacture computers  electronics and telecom equipment  as well as provide services like cloud computing  computer aided design and customer relations The report estimated that the tariffs  if they remain in place  would reduce United States gross domestic product by at least  1 trillion within 10 years  The American G D P  was about  20 5 trillion in 2018 The business community  along with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress  have been critical of Mr  Trump s tariffs but they have been willing to carry the costs of Mr  Trump s trade war if it brings about needed change  Executives across industries say they support efforts by Mr  Trump to reset an economic relationship that has too often put United States companies and workers at a disadvantage  There s no cheap way to pursue these kinds of policy objectives   said Daniel Rosen  a founding partner of the Rhodium Group  a research firm with extensive experience in China  and one of the authors of the report Businesses have long complained of unfair treatment in the Chinese market  including pressure to hand over valuable technology and discrimination against foreign companies operating there  The Trump administration has calculated that China s hacking intrusions and coerced acquisitions of technology cost American companies at least  50 billion a year alone But it remains unclear whether Mr  Trump s final deal will achieve the kind of change that would make the fight worth the cost  American negotiators have been pushing China for more substantive economic changes than it seems willing to accept  including rolling back subsidies to Chinese companies and lowering barriers to foreign competition China s lawmakers last week passed a sweeping rewrite to its laws on foreign investment  While the reforms are a nod to Mr  Trump s concerns  some China experts criticized the language as overly broad and say it represents only a step toward the kind of more transformative changes that are needed The president has insisted he could  walk  if America does not get what it wants from China  But he also wants to avoid further roiling a jittery stock market  which has fallen on news of a prolonged trade war  and to limit economic damage ahead of the 2020 election That is prompting concern among Republican lawmakers and American businesses that Mr  Trump could ultimately accept a weak deal that includes high profile purchases of American products like liquid natural gas and soybeans but only vague and ultimately unenforceable commitments in more important areas of structural reform On Thursday  Mr  Trump lauded the Chinese as  very responsible and very reasonable   and said there would be news on China  one way or the other  over the next three to four weeks  We could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory fairly easily here   said Stephen K  Bannon  President Trump s former chief strategist  He said that the president had succeeded in amping up leverage on China  but that the administration risked squandering that leverage for a deal that focused primarily on product purchases  Nobody thought Trump would be able to pull it off   he has   Mr  Bannon added   Now you might throw it away  The administration had been pushing toward a signing summit meeting with Mr  Trump and President Xi Jinping to resolve the trade conflict at the end of March  But outstanding differences over how the two sides would roll back their tariffs and enforce their agreement have prolonged the talks In a meeting last week  the president huddled with Vice President Mike Pence  the trade representative  Robert Lighthizer  and other advisers to discuss whether China is serious about offering concessions or if it was merely paying lip service to Mr  Trump  according to a person with knowledge of the situation Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  said Thursday that the administration was  pleased with the progress  of the talks and that  a lot of documents  were moving back and forth but acknowledged that a signing ceremony this month was out of the question  We still have more work to do   Mr  Mnuchin said   It s more important we get the right agreement and not rush it  but we re working diligently to try to do this as quickly as possible  The Chinese are now pushing for Mr  Xi s trip to take the form of a state visit to Washington  though plans are still in flux  people with knowledge of the discussions said Susan Shirk  chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California  San Diego  said it would take negotiators time to test which of the objectives the Chinese were able to give ground on  and which they were not  If my supposition that this is actually a more professional negotiation  a more serious one  is correct  then it s not surprising it would need more time   Ms  Shirk said   It doesn t mean things are bad  Mr  Trump s summit meeting in February with the North Korean leader Kim Jong un  which ended abruptly when Mr  Trump felt the other side was not producing enough concessions  may be another reason the United States China event has been pushed back  The Chinese are wary of sending their president halfway around the world only to return empty handed  They have been trying to iron out the details beforehand  We don t need another U S  North Korea summit  where so much was left unresolved  and in which both sides were hoping through the force of personality to persuade the other side to their viewpoint   said Gary Locke  an American ambassador to China during the Obama administration   You need all the minutiae negotiated ahead of time  A final deal could also be stymied by America s insistence that it be allowed to use tariffs against China if Beijing does not uphold its end of the agreement  China is pushing for the United States to lift all the tariffs the administration has already imposed and there is concern among Chinese officials about agreeing to a deal that does not remove all the tariffs or that allows the United States to impose additional levies in the future Mr  Trump has previously suggested the United States could keep some tariffs in place  even if a deal is reached  Without the tariffs  we wouldn t be talking   Mr  Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in January In testimony before Congress last week  Mr  Lighthizer declined to specify whether the administration would lift all of its tariffs when a deal is struck  or hold some of the levies in place and roll them back only once China accomplishes certain reforms  People familiar with Mr  Lighthizer s thinking say he prefers the latter approach  but he could yet be overruled if the White House is eager to secure a deal In China  the tone has turned more positive  potentially presaging a conclusion to the talks  Xinhua  China s state news agency  reported that Mr  Mnuchin and Mr  Lighthizer spoke with Vice Premier Liu He by phone on Thursday and made  further substantial progress  on the text of the deal 
WASHINGTON   The Trump administration s aggressive campaign to prevent countries from using Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications equipment in their next generation wireless networks has faltered  with even some of America s closest allies rejecting the United States  argument that the companies pose a security threat Over the past several months  American officials have tried to pressure  scold and  increasingly  threaten other nations that are considering using Huawei in building fifth generation  or 5G  wireless networks  Mike Pompeo  the secretary of state  has pledged to withhold intelligence from nations that continue to use Chinese telecom equipment  The American ambassador to Germany cautioned Berlin this month that the United States would curtail intelligence sharing if that country used Huawei The warnings stem from the United States  concern that Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies are a significant security threat given Beijing s control over the industry  Top officials have pointed to new Chinese security laws that require Huawei and other companies to provide information to intelligence officials  arguing China could gain access to the vast amounts of data that will ultimately travel over 5G  allowing Beijing to spy on companies  individuals and governments   an accusation Huawei has vehemently denied But the campaign has run aground  Britain  Germany  India and the United Arab Emirates are among the countries signaling they are unlikely to back the American effort to entirely ban Huawei from building their 5G networks  While some countries like Britain share the United States  concerns  they argue that the security risks can be managed by closely scrutinizing the company and its software The decisions are a blow to the Trump administration s efforts to rein in Beijing s economic and technological ambitions and to stop China from playing a central role in the next iteration of the internet American government officials are now looking for other ways to curb Huawei s global rise without the cooperation of overseas allies  including possibly restricting American companies from supplying Huawei with key components that it needs to build 5G networks across the world  It is looking dicey  We are running out of runway   said Mike Rogers  the former Republican congressman who led the House Intelligence Committee and who has long been a fierce critic of Huawei The United States is not ready to admit defeat  but its campaign has suffered from what foreign officials say is a scolding approach and a lack of concrete evidence that Huawei poses a real risk  It has also been hampered by a perception among European and Asian officials that President Trump may not be fully committed to the fight Mr  Trump has repeatedly undercut his own Justice Department  which unveiled sweeping criminal indictments against Huawei and its chief financial officer with accusations of fraud  sanctions evasion and obstruction of justice  Mr  Trump has suggested that the charges could be dropped as part of a trade deal with China  The president previously eased penalties on another Chinese telecom firm accused of violating American sanctions  ZTE  after a personal appeal by President Xi Jinping of China Those moves have only deepened concerns that the administration s fight against Huawei is not really about national security and instead reflects its political and economic ambitions European and Asian officials have complained privately that recent American intelligence briefings for allies did not share any sort of classified information that clearly demonstrated how the Chinese government used Huawei to steal information  according to people familiar with the discussions  European officials have told counterparts that if the United States has evidence the Chinese government has used its companies to do so  they should disclose it One senior European telecommunications executive said that no American officials had presented  actual facts  about China s abuse of Huawei networks Ren Zhengfei  the founder of Huawei  has accused the United States of having political motivations in leveling criminal charges against the company and has said the firm does not spy for China ImageVice President Mike Pence  in Munich last month  warned European allies about the risks of teaming up with Huawei CreditThomas Kienzle Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesUnlike the United States  European wireless networks are much more dependent on Huawei  so banning its equipment would be far more consequential  Many of the leading carriers  including Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom  use the company s equipment  and a widespread ban would result in costly changes that executives have warned may delay the debut of 5G in the region Garrett Marquis  a spokesman for the National Security Council  said the United States continued to work  with our allies and like minded partners to mitigate risk in the deployment of 5G and other communications infrastructure  Mr  Rogers said the notion that other nations could adequately manage the security risk was misplaced   They are so convinced they can get over the security problem  It defies logic   he said But he said Mr  Trump had not helped his administration s efforts by suggesting that a national security matter like Huawei could be wrapped into some type of trade pact with China  That is a big mistake   Mr  Rogers said   You have taken a national security issue and given it away in a trade deal  This is about the security of data  Europeans have their own China trade worries  which could also factor into reluctance to ban Huawei  Although European officials have grown increasingly suspicious of Beijing s growing economic might  China is still the European Union s second largest trading partner after the United States  This week  Mr  Xi is scheduled to be in Italy  I m not sure a ban is the solution   said Caroline Nagtegaal  a member of European Parliament from the Netherlands who helped write a resolution on the cybersecurity risks posed by China that avoided calling for a Huawei ban   We have to be very careful making a step like that  Many countries facing American pressure have not made any final decisions  In Britain  for instance  intelligence officials say the threat can be managed  but the government could ultimately overrule them To bolster its campaign  the administration has begun threatening retaliation against countries that do not agree to its demands Mr  Pompeo suggested in Hungary that the presence of Huawei could influence decisions on where to station troops overseas  noting that its adoption in wireless networks would make it  more difficult for America to be present   He followed up on Fox Business Network  saying if countries adopted Huawei technology  the United States  won t be able to share information  with them The American ambassador to Germany  Richard Grenell  expanded on Mr  Pompeo s public messaging with a letter to Berlin  warning of repercussions should it use Huawei  The letter was first reported by The Wall Street Journal Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany quickly shot back  saying her country was  defining our standards for ourselves  Andrea Kendall Taylor  a former American intelligence officer who is now the director of the Transtlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security  said administration officials had wrongly framed the decision for European powers as standing with either the United States or China  Countries in Europe  including Britain and Germany  do not want to make that choice  and instead want to maintain good trade relations with China  The U S  needs to approach this not as a black and white issue   Ms  Kendall Taylor said   The U S  should avoid generating more resentment in already fraught relations with the Europeans  To manage the China challenge we will need the Europeans on our side  so we need to work together  ImageA showcase for Huawei in Shenzhen  China  The American push against Huawei has suffered partly from what foreign officials say is a lack of concrete evidence that the company poses a real risk CreditWang Zhao Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has had some small victories  at least rhetorically  The Czech Republic s cybersecurity agency has issued warnings about Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies  though the government remains divided over a ban  Poland earned praise from Vice President Mike Pence for its actions against Huawei  which included arresting one of its employees on espionage charges  But as Poland courts Chinese investment  it is unclear if it will embrace a full ban The most decisive action against Huawei by an American ally is outside Europe  where Australia last year banned the company from its 5G networks The administration continues to look for other ways to put Huawei at a global disadvantage  including an executive order that would prohibit American companies from using Chinese telecommunications gear in 5G networks  Intelligence and security officials are also considering a more aggressive presidential order that would prevent American companies from supplying Huawei with components that it needs to build 5G networks While Huawei would eventually make its own version of those components  such export restrictions could slow down the company s 5G development  winning time for competitors to improve their own offerings American officials are also exploring ways to counter Huawei s biggest advantage  its low price and financing deals  Members of Congress and administration officials have discussed ways for the United States and its allies to offset the favorable financing deals China offers for its telecom equipment  Among the options under consideration is providing some type of financing to allied telecom companies building 5G networks While the United States has continued to talk tough  Mr  Trump has yet to sign any executive order that would curb Huawei s growth and his recent comments have created doubt about how far he is prepared to go Last month  the White House dispatched officials from the State  Defense and Commerce Departments and from the Federal Communications Commission to a wireless industry conference in Barcelona  Spain  to make the case against Huawei  But a few days before the convention started  Mr  Trump appeared to backtrack on his administration s position  posting on Twitter that he wanted American companies to win on their merits   not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies   The administration policy on Huawei and ZTE has been characterized by fits and starts and contradictions   said Representative Adam B  Schiff  Democrat of California  who has been a top critic of Mr  Trump   I am not sure I can make heads or tails of it  American and European officials said that behind the scenes  the negotiations were far more nuanced than the public threats  Some European officials believe that privately the White House has been more receptive to their arguments that the security threat of Chinese telecom companies can be tempered But the efforts to cajole or pressure European powers may have come too late  say current and former European and American officials  European officials have also told their American counterparts that there is no alternative to Huawei that offers better  more secure equipment  even at a higher price British officials have said the risk from Huawei can be mitigated without a ban  through tough oversight and restricting Huawei to less critical parts of its networks  The British government operates a security lab where it inspects Huawei s equipment and code for cybersecurity flaws  Last year  the inspections discovered problems with Huawei software code  but the authorities said it was not related to the Chinese government Germany is taking a similar approach  with Huawei opening a research center in the city of Bonn where security officials can review its products  The company has also opened a facility in Brussels Mark Sedwill  Britain s national security adviser  said it was more important to focus on the security of the system  not the origin of the company that made the equipment  Criminal hackers  not the governments of other countries  remain the biggest threat  he said  We think we have a pretty mature approach to this that so far   through regulation  through transparency  through setting very close standards   is protecting our interests and securing economic benefits   Mr  Sedwill said this month during a speech at the Atlantic Council

WASHINGTON   Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said on Monday that cyberthreats against the United States were a national security crisis that she described as her top priority   not the situation for which President Trump last month declared a national emergency  On top of my list of threats  that many of you can guess  the word  cyber  is circled  highlighted and underlined   Ms  Nielsen said in a speech outlining her department s focus in the coming year   The cyberdomain is a target  a weapon and a threat vector all at the same time  Mr  Trump has called the increasing flow of immigrants to the southern border one of the most urgent national security issues threatening the United States  Last week  issuing his first veto against legislation that would have blocked him from diverting Defense Department funds to build a border wall  the president described a recent spike in migrants crossing the border as an  invasion  The Department of Homeland Security oversees customs officers and immigration agents who are on the front lines of the Trump administration s campaign to close the border to illegal immigration Ms  Nielsen did dedicate a portion of her speech on Monday to what she called a  humanitarian and security catastrophe  of Central American families traveling to the border  She also noted that the projected number of migrants who may be apprehended at the southern border this month was expected to rise to 100 000  up from 76 000 in February But mentions of digital threats were dispersed throughout her approximately 35 minute address to an auditorium of various Department of Homeland Security officials Among global jihadists and transnational criminals  Ms  Nielsen listed  cyberthugs and hackers and resurgent nation state rivals  as an emerging threat to the United States  She asked two cybersecurity officials who helped safeguard the 2018 elections to stand for a round of applause Ms  Nielsen also assailed President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia and the Kremlin  for a concerted effort to undermine our elections and our democratic process using cyberenabled means   And she said the average American citizen or company was  no match  for virtual threats from Russia  China  North Korea and Iran  I am more worried about the ability of bad guys to hijack our networks than their ability to hijack our flights   Ms  Nielsen said   I am concerned about them holding our infrastructure hostage  stealing our money and secrets  exploiting children online and even hacking our democracy  John Cohen  a former acting under secretary for intelligence during the Obama administration  said law enforcement could no longer look at the threats in the digital world and the physical world as separate issues  Extremist groups now circulate videos on the internet to inspire terrorist attacks  and drug traffickers are using the dark web   something Ms  Nielsen also highlighted in her speech Mr  Cohen said he remained unclear on how Ms  Nielsen proposed combating cybersecurity threats  There is an incredible amount of talent at D H S    said Mr  Cohen  also a senior adviser at the agency during the George W  Bush administration   My concern is that talent and those capabilities are being underutilized  because in the eyes of many at the White House  the sole purpose for D H S  is to conduct its immigrant and border security activities  Ms  Nielsen said the department was focused on increasing collaboration with the private sector  citing a summit meeting held in New York last year for industry and government officials  She said she expected the cooperation between various homeland security agencies to improve when the department consolidates at a former mental hospital next month She praised the department s work in defending the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections and said she was confident in her department s ability to secure the 2020 presidential vote  Ms  Nielsen also said homeland security would continue to pursue prosecutions against foreign entities that hack the American digital infrastructure  What worries me  though  is not what these threat actors have done   Ms  Nielsen said   but what they have the capability to do  
WASHINGTON   Vice President Mike Pence was doing just fine in the background  Then a Democrat called him  decent  In their search to present themselves as the antidote to the Trump administration  a raft of Democratic presidential hopefuls are targeting Mr  Pence  an evangelical Christian and comparatively sedate figure who has showcased President Trump s hard line policies to the rest of world with a smile But a compliment last month from Joseph R  Biden Jr   the former vice president on the verge of announcing his own candidacy  thrust Mr  Pence into the 2020 conversation After Mr  Biden referred to him during a speech as a  decent guy   several Democrats lined up to say the opposite Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in an interview with MSNBC that Mr  Pence was  not an honorable person  Senator Kamala Harris of California said that she found it  outrageous  that Mr  Pence refuses to take meetings with any woman who is not his wife  a claim his office denied And Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend  Ind   a long shot presidential contender  said last week in a CNN town hall that Mr  Pence  a former governor of Indiana with whom Mr  Buttigieg used to work  had  become the cheerleader for the porn star presidency  Mr  Biden eventually walked his compliment back Lightning Rod is a new role for Mr  Pence  who has so far perfected his good cop appearance  On Friday  as Mr  Trump issued the first veto of his presidency  rejecting legislation that opposed his declaration of a national emergency to fund a wall along the southwestern border  the vice president was there to heap praise  I don t know that I ve ever been more proud   Mr  Pence told Mr  Trump   than to be standing next to you today  But his willingness to stand behind the president  coupled with the assault on his beliefs by Democratic candidates  has only further highlighted a key truth about Mr  Pence  He is less a good cop than he is a good soldier  It s possibly the case that just because the show has become so mesmerizing  there hasn t been enough attention for there to be scrutiny on him and what he represents   Mr  Buttigieg said   But there s a nontrivial chance of Pence becoming the president  any day  and we should understand what we re getting there  Mr  Buttigieg said that Mr  Pence was a politician  whose views are very much out of the mainstream   He ticked off issues like gay marriage  Mr  Pence has said he is opposed to it   climate change  Mr  Pence has said the causes of it remain to be seen   and evolution  Mr  Pence has said God created heaven and earth  as policy issues on which the vice president needed to clarify his positions Mr  Pence declined to comment publicly  but a senior administration official familiar with his thinking said he does not plan to take the bait   He just lets the criticism roll off   said that official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as to not disclose private conversations But Mr  Biden  who is seen in the White House as Mr  Trump s most formidable potential 2020 challenger  earned a public rebuke from the vice president  Well  look  they ve got an awfully big field   Mr  Pence said on Thursday in an appearance on  Fox   Friends   adding that  the way Joe Biden caved in to liberal activists after making a kind comment for me is evidence of the pressure that all of their candidates are going to face  Still  some observers of the race say the scrutiny of Mr  Pence may continue  I m surprised he hasn t been in the middle of it more   said Tim Miller  a longtime Republican strategist and a  Never Trumper    He s skillfully avoided  to a certain degree  the amount of association he should have with Trump  But Mr  Miller said the backlash to Mr  Biden s comment also  reinforces what a lot of Republicans would say  which is the fact that no matter who the Republican nominee or president or vice president would be  the Democrats would demagogue him  Hilary Rosen  a Democratic political strategist  said that Mr  Pence is a smaller target than Mr  Trump  but his conservative politics present a punch list for liberal voters  The issues Pence is most identified with   Ms  Rosen said   are ones that a majority of voters  including independents  strongly support  So he will be vulnerable  Since becoming vice president  Mr  Pence has done little to clarify his beliefs  but his office has pushed back on some of the more enduring assertions about them  like the claim by Ms  Harris that he would not take meetings alone with women That criticism stems from a 2002 interview in which Mr  Pence  then a congressman from Indiana  said that he did not dine with women who were not his wife  Karen  He absolutely meets with women   Alyssa Farah  Mr  Pence s spokeswoman  said on Friday   That s just not the case  Some Democratic candidates are also hoping to seize on Mr  Pence s track record on gay rights  and have pointed to several examples as fodder for what they think are restrictive and harmful policy decisions Privately  Mr  Pence and his aides have tried to signal that his views on gay rights are not as extreme as critics have said  and at least one defender in the Trump administration has spoken publicly in support  Richard Grenell  the United States ambassador to Germany  who recently announced an initiative to decriminalize homosexuality worldwide  For those of us in the LGBT community who deal in facts  we are chilled by recklessly repeated gossip   Mr  Grenell wrote on Twitter   Mike Pence is a humble Christian who loves God  and all His creation  I know him  You obviously don t  Mr  Buttigieg  who is gay  said that he and other Democrats would welcome an explanation from Mr  Pence  Until he does   Mr  Buttigieg said   I don t think anybody s going to be convinced that he s moderated or become any less extreme  
President Trump s new budget calls for less spending on Medicare and food stamps and more on defense and on a wall on the southern border Democrats condemned the proposal  and the dispute raises the prospect of another government shutdown this year  That might seem to be a dicey proposition for the economy  but the administration doesn t seem worried about a slowdown any time soon The president has described the current moment as  the greatest economy in the history of our country   and the official forecast is rosy  around 3 percent growth in gross domestic product every year for the next decade  and even more in 2019 and 2020 Yet some serious people remain nervous Job growth last month came in wildly below expectations  G D P  growth  which hit an annualized rate in excess of 4 percent in the second quarter of last year  has been fading ever since  The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta s GDPNow forecast suggests that the current quarter s annual growth rate might even be below 1 percent Faced with data like this  the Federal Reserve has backed off from its plan to aggressively raise interest rates and shrink its balance sheet It is worth asking  If a trade war with China or another government shutdown remains possible  are we one wrong turn away from a recession The Trump administration says these potential problems just aren t big enough to derail a  20 trillion economy  But the last several decades of American economic history provide a sobering reminder that recessions don t come only from large  foreseeable events Modest  unpredictable incidents can cause economic downturns if they lead businesses or consumers to freak out  And trade wars and government shutdowns have caused some glaring panics in the past Still  it is easy to understand the administration s perspective  First  officials remain confident that they can strike a deal that will avert a major trade war entirely  Second  even if there is a trade war  it might not damage the United States that much  After all  exports account for only 12 percent of the nation s economy  while China is less than a tenth of that Those numbers imply that even a full blown trade war that cut commerce between the United States and China in half would have a direct impact of less than 1 percent of G D P The same basic math can be applied to government shutdowns  The administration estimated that the last one  which ended in January  cut only about 0 1 percentage point from the annualized economic growth rate per week The 800 000 affected federal workers were fewer than one half of 1 percent of the nation s total work force  so even when government contractors are added  the shutdown affected just a sliver of the country s G D P  No worries there But that analysis is far too simple Seemingly small events can cause enormous problems  Think back to 2001 and the last recession of a  normal  size   The recession that started in December 2007 was  by far  the deepest and longest since the Great Depression   about as far from normal as a recession can be  The 2001 recession developed when the internet bubble popped  or at least that s how we tend to remember it  But go back and check the numbers  The internet accounted for  at most  about 2 percent of the economy then  If we use the logic we ve been applying to trade wars and government shutdowns  it would seem that popping the internet bubble shouldn t have been enough to cause a recession  But it did The reason it did was that the pop freaked out people outside just the internet sector  Consumer confidence plunged  and businesses stopped investing  The recession spread far beyond its origin In this sense  virtually every recession in the last 40 years coincided with a signal of fear  like a significant drop in consumer confidence  Sometimes confidence fell and didn t spiral into recession  but all recessions have started with a confidence spiral The very biggest drops in confidence in the last 40 years came from major events like the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the popping of the internet bubble  which led to recessions  but close on their heels were episodes of government dysfunction  which did not necessarily culminate in recessions  These include the debt ceiling crisis of 2011 and the government shutdown of 2013 The most recent shutdown seems no different in this respect  In the last survey before the government reopened  consumer confidence fell the most it had in almost three years  and confidence among chief executives dropped to the lowest level in seven years  The shutdown doesn t seem to have caused a recession  but it would be unwise to celebrate Another government shutdown could spiral into something far more damaging than the small decline in workers  share of the economy that the simple math suggests  An escalating trade war with China could ignite a recession  even if the numbers show that trade isn t a large share of the United States economy  These events just need to spook consumers or businesses into putting off spending  and then more dire consequences can start to snowball So let us all hope for excellent jobs numbers in the months to come  along with a rebound of G D P  growth  That may well happen  but it would be a mistake to be overconfident and assume that the economy will automatically weather a major policy blunder  If something scares people enough  it can start a recession  and you probably won t know until it s too late That s because recessions are hard to recognize at the start  Looking back  for example  we know that a recession officially began in April 2001  yet scarcely anyone understood that then  In June 2001  only 7 percent of economists in the monthly Blue Chip survey believed a recession was underway  In the months before that 2001 recession began  only 16 percent of economists expected that a recession would start within the next year  Now  25 percent of economists in a Wall Street Journal survey say they expect a recession within the next year  and anxiety seems to be growing The great pitcher Satchel Paige once advised   Don t look back  Something might be gaining on you   Had he been an economist  he might have added   And don t start a trade war  either  
WASHINGTON   Oleg V  Deripaska  a Russian oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin  sued the United States government on Friday  demanding it lift sanctions that he claimed have cost him billions of dollars  made him  radioactive  in international business circles and exposed him to criminal investigation and asset confiscation in Russia In a lawsuit filed in United States District Court in Washington  Mr  Deripaska said that the sanctions  leveled in April by the Treasury Department  should be struck down because they deprived him of due process and relied on unproven smears that fell outside the sanctions program The lawsuit called Mr  Deripaska  the latest victim of this country s political infighting and ongoing reaction to Russia s purported interference in the 2016 U S  presidential elections   and asserted that  the general hysteria surrounding Deripaska prevents him from having a meaningful opportunity to challenge  the sanctions  through the normal channels for doing so  The sanctions were imposed in retaliation for  a range of malign activity around the globe  by Russia  including its election interference and its incursions into neighboring Ukraine  Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  said at the time The sanctions hit seven oligarchs and their companies  including Mr  Deripaska  the giant aluminum company he controlled  Rusal  as well as the holding company that owns it  EN   and another company it controls After an intensive lobbying and legal campaign  Mr  Deripaska s companies   but not Mr  Deripaska personally   were granted sanctions relief late last year by the Treasury Department Yet Mr  Deripaska argued in Friday s lawsuit that he did not think he could get a fair shake from the same appeals process because of  overt bias  demonstrated against the oligarch by Mr  Mnuchin and his department  The lawsuit was filed against the secretary  the Treasury Department  its Office of Foreign Assets Control and Andrea M  Gacki  the director of that office A Treasury Department spokesman said that the agency  does not generally comment on pending litigation  Sanctions experts gave the lawsuit low odds of success Such a suit  gets to presidential authority that usually isn t able to be challenged like that   said Brian O Toole  who served during the Obama administration as a senior adviser to the Office of Foreign Assets Control   Gonna be a lot of lawyers  fees for no result   he wrote on Twitter The lawsuit came even as Democrats continued demanding information from Mr  Mnuchin and the Treasury Department about the deal under which Mr  Deripaska s companies were removed from sanctions The deal was billed by Treasury as penalizing Mr  Deripaska by separating him from the companies  while allowing the companies   which play an important role in global aluminum markets   to survive But a binding confidential document signed by both sides revealed that the deal would leave Mr  Deripaska and his allies with majority ownership of EN   The agreement would transfer 1 64 percent of the shares of the company  valued at about  100 million  to an entity called the Liberi Foundation  which company officials said is a trust for Mr  Deripaska s children At a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday  Senator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon  questioned Mr  Mnuchin about the transfer of shares to the trust  It sure looks like Mr  Deripaska s children are benefiting from a sanctions effort meant to punish him   Mr  Wyden said  calling the sanctions relief deal  a Keystone Kops level sanction enforcement  Mr  Mnuchin rejected the characterization  I can assure you it wasn t a Keystone Kops effort   he said  explaining that career Treasury officials at the Office of Foreign Assets Control worked hard to draft a deal that would sufficiently punish Mr  Deripaska Mr  Mnuchin said he would follow up with Mr  Wyden next week with more information about the transfer of shares to the trust fund for Mr  Deripaska s children The Treasury Department spokesman on Friday evening said that the agency  has been fully transparent  about the transfer of shares to the Liberi Foundation  noting that it was listed in the confidential document that was provided to Congress  But the document did not specify that the organization was a trust fund for Mr  Deripaska s children   and that information was not publicly available On Friday  Mr  Mnuchin announced sanctions against six Russian officials and eight entities related to  Russia s continued and ongoing aggression in Ukraine   including its seizure of Ukrainian naval vessels in a shared waterway late last year Defenders of the Trump administration s approach to Russia sanctions pointed to Mr  Deripaska s lawsuit as evidence that the Treasury Department has not gone easy on the oligarch The lawsuit claims that the effect of the sanctions  has been the wholesale devastation of Deripaska s wealth  reputation and economic livelihood   That includes reducing his net worth by more than  7 5 billion   or approximately 81 percent   while pushing his remaining businesses  to the brink of collapse   the lawsuit said The Treasury Department justified the sanctions partly by citing accusations against Mr  Deripaska of bribery  links to organized crime and even murder  But Mr  Deripaska s lawyers described the accusations as  nothing more than false rumor and innuendo and originate from decades old defamatory attacks originated by his business competitors   and  completely untethered  from the claims of aiding Russia s malign activities The Treasury Department  Mr  Deripaska contended  did not try to link him to  the interference of democratic processes  nor has Deripaska been charged anywhere in the world for doing so  
Bill Clinton had a consequential presidency when it came to the economy  He brought down the Reagan era deficits  helping spark the strongest economic boom in decades  and he made the tax code more progressive Barack Obama had an even more consequential presidency  He halted the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression  He did so in part by signing a stimulus bill full of spending on education  wind energy and other programs with lasting benefits  He also put in place new regulations for Wall Street and extended health insurance to almost 20 million people Yet for all that both men accomplished  neither changed the fundamental direction of the American economy By the end of Obama s eight years  G D P  growth was still disappointing  Middle class and poor families were still receiving less than their fair share of that growth  Median household wealth was lower than it had been two decades earlier  In the most shocking sign of struggle  average life expectancy has declined in recent years  Rich Americans  on the other hand  continue to thrive  amassing Gilded Age level concentrations of wealth  The resulting frustration helped make possible the rise of Donald Trump  This history suggests that the Democratic Party s economic agenda needs to become more ambitious  Modest changes in the top marginal tax rate or in middle class tax credits aren t enough  The country needs an economic policy that measures up to the scale of our challenges RelatedOpinionOne on One With Elizabeth WarrenAn interview with the Massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential contender March 13  2019So far  only one candidate among the 2020 contenders has an agenda with this level of ambition  Elizabeth Warren  Her platform aims to reform American capitalism so that it once again works well for most American families  The recent tradition in Democratic politics has been different  It has been largely to accept that big companies are going to get bigger and do everything they can to hold down workers  pay  The government will then try to improve things through income taxes and benefit programs  Warren is trying to treat not just the symptoms but the underlying disease  She has proposed a universal child care and pre K program that echoes the universal high school movement of the early 20th century  She favors not only a tougher approach to future mergers  as many Democrats do  but also a breakup of Facebook and other tech companies that have come to resemble monopolies  She wants to require corporations to include worker representatives on their boards   to end the era of  shareholder value maximization   in which companies care almost exclusively about the interests of their shareholders  often at the expense of their workers  their communities and their country Warren was also the first high profile politician to call for an annual wealth tax  on fortunes greater than  50 million  This tax is the logical extension of research by the economist Thomas Piketty and others  which has shown how extreme wealth perpetuates itself  Historically  such concentration has often led to the decline of powerful societies  Warren  unlike some Democrats  comfortably explains that she is not socialist  She is a capitalist and  like Franklin D  Roosevelt  is trying to save American capitalism from its own excesses  Sign up for David Leonhardt s daily newsletter with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web   Sometimes  bigger ideas are more possible to accomplish   Warren told me during a recent conversation about the economy at her Washington apartment   Because you can inspire people  Before I go further  I want to offer two caveats  One  Warren s grasp of the country s problems does not necessarily mean that she should be the Democratic nominee for president  Politics is not an expertise competition  The nominee should be  and most likely will be  the candidate who best inspires voters  Maybe that will be Warren  or maybe it will be someone else Two  I don t agree with all of Warren s proposals  Her plan to break up the big technology companies seems too uniform  for example  Her plan to put workers on corporate boards may not be as practical as  say   a big federal push to increase workers  bargaining power ImageSenator Warren s proposals include a universal child care and pre K program  and a wealth tax CreditGabriela Bhaskar for The New York TimesBut whatever my   or your   specific objections  Warren is identifying the right problems and offering a coherent vision for a post Obama Democratic agenda   Clinton and Obama focused on boosting growth and redistribution   Gabriel Zucman  a University of California  Berkeley  economist who has advised Warren  says   Warren is focusing on how pretax income can be made more equal  She isn t simply proposing larger versions of Obama s  worthy  tax cut for middle class and poor families  as several 2020 candidates have  Her plans are also much more detailed than those of Bernie Sanders  who  to his credit  pushed the party to become bolder   And she has avoided getting trapped in the health insurance wonkery that too often dominates progressive policy debates  The future of the republic does not actually depend on the relative sizes of Medicare  Medicaid and the private market It may  however  depend on whether Americans  incomes and living standards are consistently rising  In the months to come  I hope that every other 2020 candidate offers answers to the questions that Warren has taken on  How can corporate America again help create a prosperous  growing middle class  as it did from the 1940s through the 1970s  How can the power of giant corporations   over consumers  workers and smaller businesses   be constrained  How can the radical levels of wealth inequality be reversed  How can the yawning opportunity gaps for children of different backgrounds be reduced  How can the next president make changes that will endure  rather than be undone by a future president  as both Obama s and Clinton s top end tax increases were It is not surprising that Warren has jumped out to an early lead in the ideas primary  The main theme in her life  both professional and personal  has been economic opportunity  Her father was a carpet salesman at Montgomery Ward in Oklahoma City in the 1960s  until he had a heart attack  He had to switch to lower paying work as a janitor  and her mother got a minimum wage job  answering phones at Sears Warren s three older brothers all went into the military   That was their chance to make it into the middle class   she told me  Warren went to college and became a teacher  until the school chose not to renew her contract rather than give her maternity leave  She then went to a public law school   for  450 per semester   and became a bankruptcy expert  early on at the University of Houston and ultimately at Harvard  The way I see it is  I have lived opportunity   she said   I ve lived the kind of opportunity that comes from a government that invests a little in its kids  a government that tries to keep the playing field a little bit level for folks like my family  Her theory of political change has been shaped by two experiences   one failure and one success  As a professor in the 1990s  she served on a federal bankruptcy commission and fought against legal changes that favored banks over borrowers  The fight went on for a decade  and Warren s side lost  The defeat left her believing that a technocratic legislative debate    the inside game   as she calls it   almost always favors industry lobbyists The success came during the Obama administration  when she pushed for an agency to protect consumers against banks  misbehavior  The idea was new  It was also simple enough for voters to understand  She hawked it on  The Daily Show With Jon Stewart   This time  Warren s side won  Trump has since constrained the agency  but it still exists and is still doing good Those experiences help explain why Warren thinks that bigger changes are sometimes more feasible than modest ones  Bigger changes   tangible  new ideas   can overcome voter cynicism   A lot of people don t believe you can actually make any change on economics   Warren says  I would add another  even larger  example to the pattern  Obamacare  Trump has undone many of Obama s more modest changes  on taxes  climate and other areas  But Obama s grandest accomplishment endures  For all its flaws  it proved too popular to kill Warren s agenda is a series of such bold ideas  She isn t pushing for a byzantine system of tax credits for child care  She wants a universal program of pre K and child care  administered locally  with higher pay for teachers and affordable tuition for families And to anyone who asks   But how will you pay for that   Warren has an answer  Her wealth tax would raise more than  250 billion a year  about four times the estimated cost of universal child care  She is  in her populist way  the fiscal conservative in the campaign The wealth tax proposal has shifted the national debate more than any other 2020 proposal so far  It has made people realize the most middle class families pay an annual tax on their largest asset   called the property tax  But the wealthy do not  because financial holdings aren t taxed the way real estate is  Some center left economists have criticized a wealth tax as too disruptive  potentially threatening some family owned businesses  but many others have praised it   This type of wealth tax   Gene Sperling  the former top economic adviser to Obama and both Clintons  has said   is essential  Perhaps the biggest reason to be hopeful about Warren s larger agenda   separate from her fate as a candidate   is that it s popular  Americans are deeply divided on social issues like abortion  religion and  to some extent  immigration and guns  But a clear majority favors a wealth tax  A clear majority favors universal child care  A clear majority favors aggressive government action to check corporate power and create decent paying jobs  On economic issues  as Warren says   The progressive agenda is America s agenda  To other 2020 candidates  I d say  Be ambitious  Tell the country how you would end the new Gilded Age and improve people s lives  Presidential campaigns are the time for big ideas  More from Opinion

WASHINGTON   A long running federal investigation into a former White House counsel in the Obama administration is reaching a critical stage  presenting the Justice Department with a decision about whether to charge a prominent Democrat as part of a more aggressive crackdown on illegal foreign lobbying The case involving the lawyer  Gregory B  Craig  was transferred in January from federal prosecutors in New York to those in Washington  The previously undisclosed move was driven by Justice Department officials in Washington  and reflects an eagerness within the department to prosecute violations of lobbying laws after the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  focused on foreign influence in his investigations A decision about whether to prosecute Mr  Craig  who was White House counsel for President Barack Obama during his first year in office  is expected in the coming weeks  people familiar with the case said  The investigation centers on whether Mr  Craig should have disclosed work he did in 2012   while he was a partner at Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom   on behalf of the Russia aligned government of Viktor F  Yanukovych  then the president of Ukraine The work was steered to Mr  Craig by Paul Manafort  who was then a political consultant collecting millions of dollars from clients in former Soviet states  Mr  Manafort  who went on to become President Trump s campaign chairman in 2016  was sentenced this month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr  Mueller s team related to obstruction of justice and violations of banking  tax and lobbying laws stemming from his work in Ukraine The Manafort case  and others developed by Mr  Mueller  marked the first high profile criminal charges in years under the Foreign Agents Registration Act  or FARA  The 1938 law requires Americans to disclose detailed information about lobbying and public relations work for foreign governments and politicians It had rarely been used in prosecutions  even as prominent Washington lobbyists  consultants  lawyers and former public officials collected ever larger  often six  and seven figure paydays from foreign interests looking to burnish their sometimes unsavory reputations in the United States capital Mr  Manafort s case  and the investigations into Mr  Craig and other high profile consultants who worked with Mr  Manafort  have left Washington s K Street lobbying corridor scrambling to deal with the heightened scrutiny The Justice Department recently signaled that its enforcement efforts were just getting started  indicating that scrutiny of foreign influence in American politics will continue after Mr  Mueller s investigation  which began with a focus on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign One of the first significant initiatives under the new attorney general  William P  Barr  was the reorganization of the unit that oversees FARA  suggesting that enforcing laws on foreign lobbying will become a priority of his tenure The prosecutor brought in to run the unit  Brandon L  Van Grack  worked until recently in the special counsel s office  The unit falls within the Justice Department s national security division  which investigated Skadden Arps s Ukraine work and must approve any charges against Mr  Craig Mr  Craig  74  would be the first Democrat to be charged in a case spinning out of the special counsel s investigation   a distinction that could be used to rebut accusations leveled by Mr  Trump and his supporters that the investigation is a partisan witch hunt An Ivy League educated lawyer who moved easily between elite law firms and government for more than four decades  Mr  Craig worked on foreign policy and other issues during the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Obama  and joined Skadden Arps in 2010 to create a division focused on what he called  international troubleshooting  His Democratic bona fides and ties to the Obama administration were among the main reasons he was recruited by Mr  Manafort as part of an effort to build support in Washington for Mr  Yanukovych  according to lobbyists who worked on the account  They were told to emphasize to Democratic members of Congress and the media that Mr  Craig was involved in the effort For Skadden Arps  the work was lucrative  Mr  Manafort arranged for the firm to be paid more than  5 2 million in 2012 and 2013  primarily from a Ukrainian oligarch  In exchange  a team led by Mr  Craig was to produce a report that Mr  Manafort intended to use to quell Western criticism of the prosecution and jailing by Mr  Yanukovych s government of one of his rivals  the former Prime Minister Yulia V  Tymoshenko  and to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case Mr  Craig and the other Skadden Arps lawyers who worked on the account did not register as foreign agents under FARA  despite inquiries from the Justice Department at the time about whether they should have  The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was obligated to register  but it reversed itself the following year after Mr  Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine The issue started getting renewed scrutiny from the Justice Department in 2017 as Mr  Mueller s team traced the flow of overseas cash to fund Mr  Manafort s lobbying efforts  The special counsel had subpoenaed or requested documents from Skadden Arps and two lobbying firms recruited by Mr  Manafort s team to help build support for Mr  Yanukovych s government  and Mr  Mueller s investigators had interviewed people who worked with all three firms  including Mr  Craig  But last year  Mr  Mueller s team referred the matters related to the three firms to federal prosecutors in Manhattan for potential prosecution as FARA violations ImageThe investigations into Mr  Craig and others who worked with Mr  Manafort  President Trump s former campaign chairman  have left Washington s K Street lobbying corridor scrambling CreditBrian Snyder ReutersAccording to people familiar with the case  Manhattan prosecutors have retained control of the investigations of the two lobbying firms  They are Mercury Public Affairs  whose lead partner on the account was Vin Weber  a former Republican member of Congress  and the Podesta Group  led by Tony Podesta  a prominent Democratic fund raiser whose business collapsed in 2017 under the glare of Mr  Mueller s scrutiny The prosecutors have interviewed lobbyists who worked with Mercury and Podesta on the Ukraine account as recently as January  but people familiar with the interviews said the prosecutors provided no clues about their plans The investigation of Mr  Craig  on the other hand  was moved in January to Washington  where the government has signaled that it is moving quickly toward a decision about an indictment  people familiar with the case said The Justice Department s national security division announced a settlement with Skadden Arps in January that brought even more attention to Mr  Craig  He left the firm last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr  Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort In exchange for a pledge by the Justice Department not to prosecute Skadden Arps  the firm agreed to pay  4 6 million  to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA  to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on Ukraine The settlement accused Mr  Craig of working with Mr  Manafort to hide the funding from the Ukrainian oligarch for Skadden Arps s work  and of making  false and misleading  statements to other partners at the firm and the Justice Department about his interactions with a reporter for The New York Times related to the Tymoshenko report  Those representations led the Justice Department s FARA unit to conclude in January 2014 that Skadden Arps was not required to disclose the work under FARA  according to the settlement In announcing the settlement  John C  Demers  the head of the Justice Department s national security division  said Skadden Arps s failure to register under FARA  hid from the public that its report was part of a Ukrainian foreign influence campaign   depriving Americans of the ability  to consider the identity of the speaker as they evaluate the substance of the speech  Neither the settlement nor Mr  Demers named either Mr  Craig or The Times and its reporter  David E  Sanger  but their identities are clear from the context  At issue is whether Mr  Craig proactively contacted Mr  Sanger to provide and promote the report  which could fall under the public relations prong of FARA  or merely responded to inquiries from The Times and other media outlets about Skadden Arps s analysis William W  Taylor III and William J  Murphy  lawyers for Mr  Craig  said their client  did nothing that required him to register in connection with his work on the Tymoshenko report  The Skadden settlement was done without his knowledge  and the assertion that he made intentionally false statements to the FARA unit is entirely untrue  Mr  Craig s allies reject the characterization that he was integrally involved in the public relations strategy surrounding the report  And they say that in his conversation with Mr  Sanger  Mr  Craig was not speaking on behalf of the Ukrainian government  but rather correcting mischaracterizations of the report as exonerating Mr  Yanukovych s government from accusations that it prosecuted Ms  Tymoshenko for political reasons Supporters of Mr  Craig bristled earlier this month when Mr  Demers appeared to again call out both Mr  Craig and Skadden Arps at an American Bar Association conference in New Orleans  The firm  was on the hook  for FARA violations because it  made a series of representations to the Justice Department that were not accurate  based on Mr  Craig s misleading statements  Mr  Demers said  though he did not identify Mr  Craig by name He said at the conference that FARA would no longer be considered  an administrative obligation  by the Justice Department  but rather would now be regarded as  an enforcement priority  Mr  Craig s allies contend that the case against him is inconsistent with the Justice Department s previous interpretations of FARA Statements made by Justice Department leaders have contributed to this view  In the summer of 2017  Adam Hickey  an official in the National Security Division  told lawmakers that FARA was designed to make foreign influence campaigns transparent   not to discourage that conduct itself  His description of FARA focused largely on transparency through voluntary registration and ongoing records keeping   Although it contains a criminal penalty for certain willful conduct   Mr  Hickey said   the statute s focal point is an administrative reporting regime  A different statute  Section 951  was designed to punish and deter criminal behavior  he said While the Justice Department would not comment on Mr  Craig s case  a spokesman said that there is no discrepancy between Mr  Demers s comments and Mr  Hickey s testimony  The purpose of enforcement is increased transparency  and  lying to the government has always been a crime   said Marc Raimondi  a Justice Department spokesman   That is not new  nor should it be portrayed as such  
WASHINGTON   Facing billions of dollars in cleanup costs  the Pentagon is pushing the Trump administration to adopt a weaker standard for groundwater pollution caused by chemicals that have commonly been used at military bases and that contaminate drinking water consumed by millions of Americans The Pentagon s position pits it against the Environmental Protection Agency  which is seeking White House signoff for standards that would most likely require expensive cleanup programs at scores of military bases  as well as at NASA launch sites  airports and some manufacturing facilities Despite its deregulatory record under President Trump  the E P A  has been seeking to stick with a tougher standard for the presence of the chemicals in question in the face of the pressure from the military to adopt a far looser framework How the administration resolves the fight has potentially enormous consequences for how the United States is going to confront what a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called  one of the most seminal public health challenges  of the coming decades The problem is not limited to military bases  An estimated five million to 10 million people in the country may be drinking water laced with high levels of the chemicals  known as Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances  or highly fluorinated chemicals  They include thousands of people who live near military bases in states including Michigan  Pennsylvania and Massachusetts PFAS  as the chemicals are most commonly called  are present in a vast array of products  including food packaging  nonstick pans  clothing and furniture  They have been linked in recent years to cancers  immune suppression and other serious health problems But since the 1970s  the Defense Department has been one of the most frequent users of PFAS  The chemicals are a key ingredient in firefighting foam employed at bases nationwide  with military crews spraying large amounts during training exercises  and on emergency calls  into unlined basins that drain into the soil and then into groundwater In 2017  after military communities around the country began to report alarming levels of PFAS in their drinking water  the Pentagon confirmed that there were 401 known military facilities in the United States where it was used Further study by the Pentagon concluded that the PFAS contamination had turned up in drinking water or groundwater in at least 126 of these locations  with some of them involving systems that provide water to tens of thousands of people both on the bases and in nearby neighborhoods  In some instances  the Defense Department is providing temporary replacement water supplies The military and many airports nationwide have relied on PFAS based firefighting spray because it can more quickly put out liquid fuel fires and it works when mixed with both fresh water and seawater The Defense Department has been moving in recent years to phase out the use of the most worrisome version of these chemicals and replace them with a formulation that does not break down in the environment as easily or build up as much in the bloodstream if it ends up in drinking water  But this replacement chemical is also generating health concerns The E P A    after intense criticism from communities facing contaminated water  as well as from both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill   is moving toward creating two new PFAS standards to address the problem nationwide The first would establish guidelines for when cleanups will be required at federally controlled sites to try to prevent that contamination from reaching drinking water supplies The second would set a legally binding  maximum allowable drinking water level for PFOS and PFOA  two of the most common forms of PFAS  Separately  the E P A  is preparing to designate these chemicals hazardous substances  meaning areas contaminated can be designated Superfund sites  formalizing the cleanup effort The E P A  completed its work on the first step  the proposed groundwater cleanup standard  last August  and transferred it to the White House Office of Management and Budget for approval  with a prediction that it would be finalized and made public by last fall But federal officials briefed on the negotiations  including the office of Senator Thomas R  Carper  Democrat of Delaware  the ranking member of the Senate committee that oversees the E P A   said major objections were raised by the Pentagon  as well as by NASA  another major user of PFAS  and the Small Business Administration Among the sites that could be subjected to a cleanup are NASA s launch sites at Cape Canaveral  Fla   and Wallops Island  Va The E P A   Mr  Carper said  proposed that contaminated sites be cleaned up to a level equivalent to the E P A  s current drinking water health advisory of 70 parts per trillion of PFOS and PFOA  citing information provided to his office ImagePFAS foam at the Van Etten Creek dam last year in Oscoda CreditJake May The Flint Journal  via Associated PressBut the Pentagon  in a report to Congress last year  indicated that it believed that an appropriate cleanup level for PFAS would be 380 parts per trillion  or nearly six times the proposed E P A  advisory drinking water level  That 380 parts per trillion is also more than 30 times a level suggested as safe for drinking water by the Department of Health and Human Service s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry   One part per trillion is equivalent to one drop of water in 20 Olympic size swimming pools  The Defense Department has also argued that the two variants of these chemicals   PFOS and PFOA   should be counted separately  as opposed to the E P A   which wanted the combined total to be used as the groundwater standard  Mr  Carper said in a letter sent this week to the E P A The Pentagon has agreed to clean up groundwater to the 70 parts per trillion standard  if contamination of either of the chemicals at a site is found above 400 parts per trillion  according to Mr  Carper s letter  That would mean many sites that would have been subject to cleanup requirements based on the E P A  s original proposal would now be able to avoid such remediation efforts   and costs   potentially polluting drinking water in the future  Many of these sites have languished for years  even decades  How can these Americans prosper if they cannot live  learn  or work in healthy environments   Mr  Carper said in his letter  quoting Andrew Wheeler  the E P A  administrator  in his own words during Mr  Wheeler s recent confirmation hearing  as Mr  Carper urged Mr  Wheeler not to give in to pressure from the Pentagon  Please take prompt action to finalize groundwater clean up guidelines for PFAS that live up to your stated objectives and reject efforts by other federal agencies to weaken them   Mr  Carper wrote Patrick M  Shanahan  the acting secretary of defense  was asked about the matter on Thursday during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing  Mr  Shanahan told Senator Jeanne Shaheen  Democrat of New Hampshire  where there is also a military base related contamination problem  that he was not aware if the Pentagon was trying to weaken the groundwater standard  But he said he would look into it  very quickly  Frustration is only increasing across the United States as the Trump administration moves slowly to confront the challenge Just Wednesday  the Vermont Senate voted 29 to 0 in favor of legislation that would create a new limit on PFAS in drinking water that at 20 parts per trillion is far tougher than even the current E P A  drinking water advisory standard  The legislation will also require annual testing by public water systems in the state The move was motivated in part by widespread contamination caused by a manufacturing plant in Bennington  Vt   called Chemfab  that once made fabrics and roofing materials coated with the chemicals  Chemfab is now closed Maureen Sullivan  the deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment  told a House panel last week that a  very  very rough  back of the envelope calculation  yielded an estimate that the Pentagon was facing a  2 billion cleanup effort  But the price tag depends a great deal on what the government decides represents  clean  Heather Babb  a Pentagon spokeswoman  declined to address what specific number the Defense Department is urging the White House to adopt as the new groundwater cleanup standard The department  will work in collaboration with regulatory agencies and communities to ensure our resources are applied effectively to protect human health across the country as part of a national effort led by E P A    she said in a written statement   However  we do not discuss the details of our interagency coordination  A NASA spokeswoman and a spokesman for the White House s Office of Management and Budget both declined to comment Jennifer McLain  the acting director of the E P A  s Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water  declined to discuss the different proposals  but she did not dispute that the E P A  and the Pentagon have different points of view  Each one of those agencies has a different mission and will be looking at the issue from a different perspective   she said Several state and local governments   including the Security Water District in Colorado  the city of Newburgh  N Y   and the state of New Mexico   have already filed lawsuits against the Defense Department In Oscoda  Mich   a community near the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base  use of the

For Muslims  Friday Prayer is like Sunday Mass for Christians  It s the day of community prayer  We travel to our local mosques  our religious sanctuary  Our families gather in the early afternoon to pray as a community  Kids run through the halls as the imam recites the Quran in Arabic  We eat together and mingle outside This week  as those of us in the United States attend Friday Prayer  the Muslims in Christchurch  New Zealand  are preparing for funerals People around the world are praying for the dead in Christchurch after terrorist attacks at two mosques  The authorities say a 28 year old Australian walked into two mosques with assault rifles and killed at least 49 people  New Zealand s prime minister  Jacinda Ardern  called it  an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence  Thoughts and prayers are not enough  These attacks are the latest manifestation of a growing and globalized ideology of white nationalism that must be addressed at its source   which includes the mainstream politicians and media personalities who nurture  promote and excuse it If the gunman s 74 page manifesto and social media posts are to be believed  he was inspired by a thriving online ideological structure that recruits and radicalizes mostly men to save  Western civilization  from a foreign  invasion  We ve seen this before  The gunman s justifications for his act of terrorism were similar to those in the 1 500 page manifesto that the Norwegian Anders Breivik posted before he killed 77 people in 2011  Mr  Breivik wanted to punish Europe for its multiculturalism and welcome of Muslim immigrants  His manifesto and attacks are said to have inspired the white nationalist Christopher Hasson  who was recently arrested on charges of stockpiling weapons with the desire to commit mass murder  especially against Muslims If the idea that Muslims are a threat sounds familiar  it s in part because it was used by President Trump to argue for a wall to protect America from a  caravan  of Central American migrants seeking asylum  He asserted that  Middle Easterners  were in the caravan  a claim he admitted he could not back up  During a summer trip to England  Mr  Trump warned that Britain was losing its  culture  and that immigration had  changed the fabric of Europe   and unless you act very quickly  it s never going to be what it was  Arguing for his travel ban aimed at mostly Muslim countries  Mr  Trump said   I think Islam hates us   lied about seeing Muslims celebrate the Sept  11 attacks  and retweeted a fringe anti Muslim group s fake videos of Muslim refugees committing violence  No wonder the Christchurch manifesto praised Mr  Trump as  a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose  It s clear that the dangers of white nationalism aren t limited to the United States  This attack is a reminder that this dangerous ideology also threatens immigrant communities worldwide  and that it s fueled by leaders around the world Australia  where the gunman is said to be from  has plenty of its own anti Muslim  xenophobic rhetoric In 2015  a movement called Reclaim Australia organized protests against the  enforcing of Shariah law in Australia  and  the teaching of Islam in government schools   The Conversation reported that placards displayed by the group at a rally read  Islam is an enemy of the West   A key policy goal of the far right political party Australian Liberty Alliance is to  stop the Islamization of Australia   Its website warns   Islam is not merely a religion  it is a totalitarian ideology with global aspirations  While Australia s prime minister  Scott Morrison  described the suspect as  an extremist  right wing  violent terrorist   an Australian senator  Fraser Anning  responded to the Christchurch attack by blaming  the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place  It seems the senator shares similar sentiments with mass murderers ImageAmbulance workers transported a man outside a mosque in central Christchurch  New Zealand  on Friday CreditMark Baker Associated PressIn his manifesto  the gunman  who referred to himself as a  regular white man   wrote that he was carrying out the attack to  directly reduce immigration rates to European lands by intimidating and physically removing the invaders themselves  The manifesto reveals an obsession with white supremacy  discussing the Battle of Vienna in 1683  which is glorified by white nationalists and Mr  Breivik as the critical moment when Europe staved off the Ottoman Empire s advance and protected itself from Islam  Text scrawled on the gunman s weapons appears to refer to military battles such as the 1189 Siege of Acre  a victory for the Christian Crusaders seeking to retake Jerusalem from Muslims  He mentioned Alexandre Bissonnette  who shot and killed six people in a Quebec mosque in 2017 and was a known white nationalist with anti immigrant and anti Muslim resentment His ideas   and their sources and supporters   were familiar to me  As a researcher for the Center for American Progress Action Fund s 2011 investigation  Fear Inc   The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America   I connected fringe anti Muslim conspiracies   such as the made up threat of Shariah law in America   to the funding sources  think tanks  media personalities  grass roots groups and politicians who created and promoted them These entities have worked together to reinforce the message that Muslim Americans are inherently radical and represent a  demographic time bomb  that will overtake the white population  Mr  Breivik repeatedly cited these groups and people  many of them now closely linked to the Trump administration  Although they should not be blamed for Mr  Breivik s violence  Marc Sageman  a former C I A  officer and a consultant on terrorism  said Mr  Breivik nonetheless emerges from the same ideological network Among white nationalists  major motivators is  the great replacement  conspiracy theory  They fear that Jews  blacks and Muslims will replace white people and eventually subordinate them  Jews are often viewed as the diabolical head of the cabal  the nerve center  who use their infinite wealth and power to reduce and weaken the white man In October  Robert Bowers walked into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and killed 11 Jewish worshipers  He posted on the right wing social network Gab that the Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS  likes to bring invaders in that kill our people  and  I can t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered   He also re shared a post about punishing  filthy evil Jews  for bringing  filthy evil Muslims into the country   This echoed the anti Semitic conspiracy theory that Jewish billionaire George Soros funded the migrant  caravan    a lie that was promoted by President Trump and other prominent conservatives Representative Steve King  an Iowa Republican  recently asked   White nationalist  white supremacist  Western civilization   how did that language become offensive  He once tweeted   We can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies   referring to the children of Latino immigrants  Steve Bannon  President Trump s former chief adviser and former head of Breitbart News  has recommended the racist  dystopian novel  Camp of the Saints   in which brown immigrants invade and take over France While news of the New Zealand shooting was breaking  President Trump tweeted a link   which he has since deleted   to the home page of Breitbart News  a site that has regularly published anti Muslim and anti immigrant conspiracy theories Upon learning about the massacre in Christchurch  a Muslim friend messaged me   How will we keep our kids safe  I didn t have a good answer  But I know the threat we re facing isn t just individual terrorists  It s the global ideology of white nationalism and white supremacy  We have to take it seriously  and call out politicians  academics and media personalities who give it a platform under the guise of exploring both sides  fostering debate or avoiding political correctness The cost is too great  Just look to Christchurch and the 49 worshipers who should have returned home to their families and community instead of attending their last prayer RelatedOpinion   Charlie Warzel  The New Zealand Massacre Was

A United States Navy veteran held in Iran since July while visiting an Iranian girlfriend has been sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges that he insulted the country s top leader and posted a private photograph on social media  his family s lawyer said Friday The lawyer  Mark Zaid  said the family had been informed earlier this week by the State Department of the sentencing of the veteran  Michael R  White  46  of Imperial City  Calif The information was conveyed to the State Department by Swiss diplomats who represent American interests in Iran  Mr  Zaid said in a telephone interview  He said Mr  White  who has been incarcerated in the northeast city of Mashhad since his arrest eight months ago  has twice been granted Swiss consular visits Mr  White served in the Navy for 13 years and is the first American imprisoned in Iran since President Trump took office more than two years ago The arrest has thrust a new irritant into what has become an increasingly confrontational relationship between the Trump administration and Iran ImageMichael R  White  an American Navy veteran  in an undated photograph Creditvia Joanne WhiteMr  Zaid said Mr  White had been given two hearings in an Iranian court  on March 6 and March 9  and was sentenced to two years for insulting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  the country s top leader  and 10 years for the posting of a private photo  He said it appeared that the sentences were to run concurrently Iranian officials have not explained further details of the two charges  Nor has Mr  White been permitted direct communication with his family  Mr  Zaid said Mr  White s family has said he traveled to Iran with a valid visa and his sole purpose was to visit a woman with whom he had fallen in love  Precisely how they met  and additional details about the woman  have not been disclosed Mr  White s mother  Joanne White  has repeatedly said she fears her son is in failing health and may have suffered a cancer recurrence while in Iran At least three other Americans have been imprisoned by Iran   Siamak Namazi  since October 2015  Baquer Namazi  since February 2016  and Xiyue Wang  since August 2016  All are accused of spying and sedition related activities  which they have denied  Another American  Robert A  Levinson  has been missing in Iran since 2007 Their families in the United States  increasingly bitter about the apparent inability of American officials to secure their release  attended a congressional hearing last week to voice their grievances and urge the government to do more  including establishing a dialogue with Iran  After three very different presidential administrations  we are no closer to bringing Bob home than when we started   Christine Levinson  Mr  Levinson s wife  said during her testimony   We have nothing  
WASHINGTON   The relationship began in the most Washington way ever  on the set of C Span Will Fischer  then the director of government relations for VoteVets  the liberal political action committee  was tapped to face off with Dan Caldwell  the executive director of the conservative Concerned Veterans for America  It was a continuation of a yearslong and contentious dialogue over veterans issues  including disputes over health care  which candidates care more about matters important to veterans  as well as their dueling views on the nefarious nature of the Republican or Democratic parties But then the two found an unanticipated policy bridge  and have now gone on to work together to persuade Congress to finally revoke authorizations of military force passed after Sept  11  2001  which both believe have been bent and stretched to justify wars far beyond Congress s intentions nearly two decades ago  I honestly did go into the interview expecting a combative conversation   Mr  Caldwell said   but when we started talking about foreign policy  it was clear there were some areas of alignment especially on war powers  The wheels started turning in my head  and we came together and decided to pursue some of these shared goals  Both groups   who are wolf to the other s sheepdog on nearly every other policy issue   intend to share a legislative agenda this year that presses for changes to war authorization measures and an end to the United States  presence in Afghanistan  They plan to more strongly tie their substantial financial and news media support in 2020 to candidates  views on foreign policy  There are only two vets groups in America that spend money on policies like this   said Jon Soltz  chairman of VoteVets   We bring a real cinder block to this house that is going to be built around this issue  Congress has been debating how to deal with its role in the use of military force for nearly a decade  Lawmakers voted in 2001 to authorize force in response to the Sept  11 attacks and  in 2002  for the invasion of Iraq  But under three presidents  the executive branch increasingly stretched that authority to justify combat action far from Afghanistan and Iraq Many lawmakers believe that both authorizations are being extended well beyond their intent and now usurp the role of Congress under the Constitution to decide when the country will go to war  Yet both political parties have been unable to agree on how much to curtail the executive branch and have been reluctant to move forward to end the agreements Lawmakers in each party have already demonstrated an increasing desire to curb Mr  Trump s decisions in Syria  Yemen and beyond  The large increase of veterans in the House  matched with the firepower behind these two organizations on both ends of the political spectrum  means that lawmakers who have long pushed for changes to the authorizations believe their time has come  I think with the Democrats now in control of the House it is much more likely we will have focused attention on pulling congressional powers away from the White House into the Congress   said Senator Tim Kaine  Democrat of Virginia  who repeatedly pushed to repeal and replace the Sept  11 authorization He has written a proposal with Senator Todd Young  Republican of Indiana  that would revoke a different  lingering war authorization from the 1991 Persian Gulf war along with the 2002 Iraq war law   We see an increasing uneasiness with the way a president thinks he can go to war without us   he said Representative Max Rose  a moderate Democrat from New York who served in the Army in Afghanistan  is already a co sponsor of a longstanding measure written by Representative Barbara Lee  Democrat of California  that would repeal the current authorization for Iraq ImageTwo veterans organizations with opposite political views are collectively pressing for changes to war authorization measures and an end to the American presence in Afghanistan  like this deployment in Helmand Province CreditAndrew Renneisen Getty Images We ve given presidents of both parties too much authority to go anywhere at any time without oversight or approval   Mr  Rose said   I refuse to commit another generation s worth of blood and treasure to intractable conflicts for which we have neither a clear national security interest nor a viable exit strategy  Several other veterans said they also supported revisiting the issue Representative Daniel Crenshaw  Republican of Texas  using the abbreviation for the authorization for the use of military force  said that Congress should be receptive to modifying such measures   We should always be open to updating A U M F s   he said   The question will be  What is the best way to do that without disrupting the ongoing operations around the globe that serve our national security interest  The subjects of war powers and congressional authority have long made strange bedfellows  Senator Rand Paul  Republican of Kentucky  is now aligned with Senator Tom Udall  Democrat of New Mexico  to wind down the 17 year military campaign in Afghanistan   I have talked to the president about 20 times about this   Mr  Paul said  noting that Mr  Trump has been publicly opposed to forever wars   Part of the problem is the people around him  But these issues have rarely had the clout of political groups like VoteVets   which played an instrumental role in pushing lawmakers to turn on the war in Iraq and spent  17 million on candidates in the last election cycle   and the Concerned Veterans for America  which has the ear of the Trump administration on veteran affairs and substantial backing by the billionaire Charles G  Koch  who has given millions to political races and policy fights  The Koch network has invested substantially in advancing their foreign policy vision over the past few years   Mr  Caldwell said  adding of his group   When we engage on an issue  we do it in a way where we can make the most impact  Also  one thing we will be weighing more heavily when considering supporting candidates is their alignment with us on foreign policy  Representative Eliot L  Engel  Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs  has been slowly seeking to build consensus among Democrats around the contentious issue by pushing measures like the one to end American military aid to Saudi Arabia  Congress has constitutional authority over war powers  but for too long  we ve ceded that responsibility to the executive branch   he said   I m working to reclaim our prerogatives and increase transparency about American military involvement  Public support for Congress asserting its authority in war powers would be  very meaningful to members   said one Democratic aide  when told of the alliance between the two veterans organizations Senator Jim Risch  Republican of Idaho and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  has been an ally of the Trump administration  which has opposed new authorization measures But he said that may come before his committee anyway   We may get there   he said  calling war authorization  one of the most interesting yet vexing issues  he has seen in his entire public service career   I would love someone to come up with a silver bullet   he said In the meantime  the two veterans organizations  which took opposite sides in expensive and bruising Senate battles last year  will continue to try to destroy each other outside these matters  We might disagree on 99 percent of things   Mr  Soltz said   but if we agree to get that one perfect thing done  we have credibility because of our work on those other issues

delivered to your inbox  I love La Gordiloca  and I love her truck By Simon Romero in Laredo  Tex Some here in the Texas border city of Laredo drive special edition Texas themed trucks  Others prefer a reliable old Ford or tricked out lowrider style pickups But one of the most recognizable trucks in all of Laredo belongs to Priscilla Villarreal  the border news reporting sensation and scourge of local authorities also known as La Gordiloca  Her ride  A rickety 1998 Dodge Ram held together  it seems  with not much else except for spit and glue The dashboard in her Dodge is crumbling  The seatbelts don t work  And what about air conditioning  in a city where summer temperatures regularly hover around 100 Fahrenheit  Just roll down the windows   said Ms  Villarreal  34  as she guided me around Laredo last month for the  profile I wrote for The New York Times  We spent the afternoon racing to the scene of a tractor trailer accident  following up leads on graft scandals and stopping for a refreshment of nieve de garrafa  a delicious frozen treat Ms  Villarreal   whose nickname could be translated  she says  as Crazy Fat Lady   is one of Laredo s most famous journalists  The news she broadcasts to her 120 000 followers on Facebook is salted with curses in equal parts English and Spanish  and it s delivered by live stream from the pickup truck she affectionately calls the Blue Demon The vehicle  for which she paid the princely sum of  700  is more than just a means of transportation for Ms  Villarreal   it s her calling card Upon seeing Ms  Villarreal s truck  motorists in Laredo often roll down their own windows and shout greetings  Parking attendants scramble for the keys when Ms  Villarreal shows up for lunch at La Posada Hotel  I love La Gordiloca  and I love her truck   said Ramón Santoyo  31  an air conditioning technician who walked up to Ms  Villarreal and took a selfie with her   It shows she s authentic and hard working  You have to respect that  Throughout the day I spent with Ms  Villarreal in her Dodge  we roamed the parts of Laredo where  if news is happening  she s most likely to find it She drove us through the gritty Las Cruces neighborhood where she was raised  past warehouses where people buy used clothing to sell in Mexico and down along the Rio Grande  near the site where a gunman had recently fired rounds at Border Patrol agents from across the border in Nuevo Laredo Ms  Villarreal arrived too late to that story to get shot at herself  but while there are no bullet holes in the Blue Demon  there s very little else that hasn t happened to it  The truck bears the marks of storms  potholes  high speed rushes to crime scenes and abrupt parking jobs  Laredo s a tough town   she said   To do what I do  you need a tough truck  Simon is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border  Each week they ll be sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people who

 Senate rejects Trump s declaration of emergencyThe Senate on Thursday afternoon voted 59 41 to reject President Trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border  Over the

most   people around the world will never visit the border  will never know firsthand what it s like  Instead  their experience is filtered through popular films and television shows   far more accessible than a plane ride to El Paso And so we spoke with Chris Vognar  a writer based in Texas  who recently wrote this piece for The Times about what happens when American filmmakers try to cross the border  He told us what filmmakers get wrong  and right  when telling stories from the border  and what works are worth your time The New York Times  If I had just one afternoon and wanted to spend it watching a movie or a television show to understand the border  what should I watch Chris Vognar  I don t think any one movie or show can sum up the complexities of the border  but I still love  El Norte   It manages to look at both the dream and the nightmare of border crossing  Read a 1984 New York Times article about the making of  El Norte   in which the director recounts how armed men seized negatives from the crew  Now let s flip that  What movie or TV show has gotten it so abjectly wrong that I should delete it from my queue I like  Narcos  O K   but it s a prime example of using the border for showcasing the carnage and destruction wrought by the drug war  Nothing wrong with that  but it s pretty limited in thematic scope Your piece is mostly about American films  Is there a project from the southern side of the border you would recommend I really like the imagination of the Mexico America coproduction  Sleep Dealer   2009   It conjures dystopian images and ideas that also fit in with current debates and issues  including the link between immigration and labor  From 2009  watch an Anatomy of a Scene feature narrated by the  Sleep Dealer  director Alex Rivera  Number of the week  245It was nearly nine months ago that the Trump administration  prompted by an intense backlash  officially rescinded its policy of separating migrant families at the United States Mexico border Since then  according to the latest data  245 children have been removed from their families  under circumstances that officials with Customs and Border Protection said were legal But government officials told the Times journalists Miriam Jordan and Caitlin Dickerson that some employees had raised concerns over separations that appeared to have little or no justification  And a failure to maintain accurate records suggests that more children could have been separated than the 245 currently known Read their full story here Read earlier installments of Crossing the Border here

To the Editor  Will Mr  Trump Trade Away the Future    editorial  March 10  sets up soybeans as a scapegoat if the administration removes its tariffs under an initial deal that doesn t resolve structural concerns with Chinese trade and business practices  To suggest that farmers are pushing the administration to accept a lesser deal is unfair The American Soybean Association has been vocal that the retaliatory tariff imposed by China on imports of United States soybeans must be removed in any agreement  But we have also supported addressing long term structural issues with China  We are skeptical of one off commitments by China to buy American soybeans and have advocated for tariff and nontariff barriers to be removed so that we can compete on a level playing field Long before China s trade practices became an issue for the national media and a political football in Washington  American soybean farmers were working to establish a relationship with China s livestock industry and government that has fostered greater interdependence between our two countries  Any agreement that dials back the current tariffs should not be criticized as a political concession to our industry  It should be recognized as a necessary step toward finding better balance in a difficult but essential trade relationship Davie StephensClinton  Ky The writer is president of the American Soybean Association  
The chief executive of Boeing backed down on Wednesday  He called President Trump to recommend that the United States temporarily take the company s best selling jet out of service  following two deadly crashes in less than five months  Hours later  the president announced that the plane had been grounded It was a stark reversal for Boeing  an industrial juggernaut that has enjoyed a decade of rapid growth and has deep ties in Washington  Just the day before  the chief executive  Dennis A  Muilenburg  had urged the president to keep the plane flying  as regulators around the world banned the jet The plane  the 737 Max  was deeply rooted in the company s psyche  a reflection of its engineering prowess and its enviable safety record  But it was also born out of necessity as the company competed aggressively with its European rival Airbus The stakes for Boeing are high  with 4 600 pending orders that promise to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars  All that is at risk as regulators and lawmakers begin to investigate what went wrong with the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight and an earlier one on Lion Air  Some carriers are already reconsidering their purchases

biggest and most important rival coming up with this fuel efficient jetliner natalie kitroeffBoeing scrambles to respond quickly archived recording MUSIC  We are making a decision to invest in the 737 family natalie kitroeffAnd within months  the company comes up with an upgrade of its own archived recordingMax efficiency  which leads to profitability  max reliability  and to the flying public  max passenger appeal natalie kitroeffIt s going to be a fuel efficient version of their 737 workhorse  It is going to have bigger engines  And it s going to save airlines money on this fuel archived recordingThe best single aisle airplane in the world   MUSIC natalie kitroeffAnd they re going to call it the 737 Max  And one of the main goals of this engineering process is to keep this new plane as similar to its predecessor as possible michael barbaroWhy natalie kitroeffPart of the reason is that Boeing is competing with Airbus  And they re competing with them on every single cost item  And a plane is not just metal and technology  It s also what it costs to operate the aircraft and to train pilots to fly it michael barbaroHm natalie kitroeffIf the 737 Max turned out to be so different from its predecessor that it required training on a flight simulator  one of these giant machines where you have a cockpit and it mimics the experience of flying the plane  it would cost airlines tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft  It s incredibly expensive  So if Boeing were to say  we have this beautiful new jet  but it s going to require twice the amount of training that the Airbus model requires  the executives might pause on that  So as the company is manufacturing this plane  it wants to find ways to make it fly exactly the way that its predecessors did michael barbaroSo that there is not a need for training natalie kitroeffExactly  And there s a little bit of a problem  music natalie kitroeffThere is something that is fundamentally different about this plane  Its engines are bigger  and those engines need to be mounted farther forward on the wings  And that changes the aerodynamics of the plane  So the placement of those engines makes the nose of the plane push upward in certain circumstances  And that can lead to a stall  which is a dangerous situation  So Boeing has to come up with a solution to make the plane act the way its predecessor did and to counteract that force  So what it does is it comes up with this system  this software michael barbaroAnd what does the new system do natalie kitroeffThe new system automatically corrects for that upward motion of the nose  And it pushes the nose down automatically  And it s supposed to be working in the background  in a way that pilots don t even notice  correcting for an issue that was not in the prior model of this plane  And it s supposed to be something that is just keeping the pilot in a position where he or she feels as though the plane is flying in the same exact way under the same conditions that the prior model did michael barbaroSo Boeing thinks even though the engines are different  that they have developed a system that makes the engines operate essentially the same way the old 737 did  And from a pilot s point of view  therefore  there would be no need for new training natalie kitroeffYes  Boeing believed there was no need for extra training for pilots who had flown the previous model  And the Federal Aviation Administration agreed  In March 2017  the F A A  certified the plane  It did not require flight simulator training for pilots who had flown the prior model  And regulators around the world followed suit  Two months later  Boeing shipped out its first 737 Max out of Seattle  And the company decided that it does not need to fully inform pilots that this new software even exists michael barbaroHmm  So they don t even tell the pilots  They think it is so unimportant to the operation of the plane from the experience of a pilot that they don t even need to know natalie kitroeffYes  music michael barbaroSo what happens next  This plane is certified  on the market  What happens archived recordingWell  it s wheels up for Boeing s new 737 Max natalie kitroeffOrders come pouring in from across the globe archived recordingBoeing says the Max 8 is the company s fastest selling plane in its history  with nearly 4 700 orders for more than 100 customers across the world natalie kitroeffAnd carriers make this the best selling Boeing jet ever archived recording100 737 Maxes expected to be sold to AerCap  That s a lessor from the Netherlands  Also  Korean Airlines expected to order 30 of those natalie kitroeffPilots love it archived recordingIt flew beautifully  Its engines were extremely quiet natalie kitroeffIt is a hit archived recording 1Still  take a look at shares of Boeing  which  archived recording 2Are up  And up today natalie kitroeffThey re enjoying a ton of success in the stock market archived recording 14Logged orders or commitments for almost 400 aircraft  with a total sticker price of more than  37 billion natalie kitroeffInvestors love them  customers love them   until October 29  2018  when Lion Air Flight 610  a 737 Max carrying 189 people  takes off and  12 minutes later  crashes into the Java Sea archived recordingThree days after Lion Air Flight JT610 mysteriously disappeared before plummeting into the sea  there may be hope for answers michael barbaroWhat do we learn about what went wrong on that flight archived recordingMilitary personnel have found one of the black boxes natalie kitroeffSo a picture begins to emerge of this flight that suggests that the pilot may be fighting with that system archived recordingFlight data shows the on board computers were pushing the plane s nose down  Then the pilots aimed the nose higher  That happened 26 times  with the crew never following procedures to correct the problem natalie kitroeffSo while the software is pushing the nose down  the pilot is trying to push it back up over and over and over again  multiple times  That is the picture that begins to emerge  But we do not have full conclusive evidence yet michael barbaroSo it seems like the pilots on this flight are fighting a flight control system  a self correcting one that s supposed to keep the nose from going up  that they don t even know exists  right natalie kitroeffThat s exactly right  And what experts believe was happening was that this system was taking in a faulty sensor reading  So it was responding to bad data  And that is why it kept triggering over and over and over again  despite the pilot s best efforts to get the plane back on course michael barbaroAnd eventually those pilots lose their battle against the system natalie kitroeffEventually  the plane plunges into the sea  killing all 189 people on board  music michael barbaroWhat  Natalie  is the reaction among the airlines that have bought this line of planes to this emerging realization that Boeing hadn t revealed what turned out to be this important piece of information  the existence of this system that may likely have contributed to this crash natalie kitroeffPilots are furious   livid  in fact   that they have not been informed that this thing even exists  So they have these meetings  in which they told Boeing officials that this was a breach of trust and that it was disrespectful michael barbaroSo I have to assume that these angry pilots  in addition to just wanting to be sure everyone knows about this system  are demanding training so that they can properly respond to this system natalie kitroeffNo  they re not  The F A A   Boeing  nobody is recommending more training on this system michael barbaroWhy not natalie kitroeffThe American pilots that I ve talked to  they believe that because they ve been informed about the system  now that they know how it works  they are able to safely fly this plane  They know how to deal with this software if it becomes an issue on their flights  And they feel confident about flying the plane  This is a confidence that s  in part  based on statistics and experience  There has been only one fatality on U S  airlines in the last decade  Boeing has an enviable safety record  In many ways  they had good reason to be confident  And they re also promised a fix to the software that pushes the nose down  That s going to come within the next several weeks  They will be informed of it  And they feel confident that that is enough michael barbaroO K   so after this Lion Air crash  the only thing that changes is that Boeing vows to fix the system  But no additional training is ordered for any pilot anywhere  And the 737 Max planes are free to keep flying natalie kitroeffYes archived recording 1A jet has crashed  and the tragedy is being felt around the world archived recording 2U S  aviation investigators and a technical team from Boeing are headed to Ethiopia tonight  That s where a new 737 Max 8 jetliner crashed today  minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa archived recording 3Killing everyone on board  Flight 302 was en route to Nairobi  Kenya  when it crashed in the town of Bishoftu just six minutes after takeoff  The plane was carrying 149 passengers and 8 crew members natalie kitroeffImmediately  it becomes apparent that there are some similarities between this flight and the Lion Air crash archived recording 1Preliminary data shows a  quote   clear similarity  to the Lion Air Max 8 crash off Indonesia in October archived recording 2Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts archived recording 3What we now understand is what people had suspected  that there are certain similarities between the Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian crash earlier this month michael barbaroWhat are those similarities natalie kitroeffSo the pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported flight control problems  So that was a first clue  The plane is also moving in the same way that the Lion Air plane was  up and down  The speeds are changing rapidly  suggesting that the pilot may have been fighting with this system  again  with the pilot trying to pull the nose up  and the system pushing it down  Then there is physical evidence recovered at the site of the crash that seems to suggest that the nose was being pitched down  We don t know why  But again  it all points to this system being involved  potentially contributing to another tragedy michael barbaroAnd so what is the reaction this time  after the second crash of a 737 Max natalie kitroeffBoeing stands firm behind the plane  And American carriers are right there with them  But  archived recordingChina has grounded its entire Boeing 737 Max fleet natalie kitroeff  regulators around the world seem a little less confident  The Chinese and Indonesians quickly ground the 737 Max archived recordingMore countries following China s lead and grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet natalie kitroeffOnce the Europeans follow  archived recordingEuropean Aviation Safety Agency  they have banned flights of the 737 Max series  adding to similar groundings by China  Indonesia  Australia  Malaysia  the U K   Singapore  New Zealand  France  Germany  Italy  Ireland  Netherlands  Turkey  I could go on natalie kitroeff  American regulators are all of a sudden under immense pressure for the F A A  to ground these planes archived recording  donald trump Boeing is an incredible company  They are working very  very hard right now  And hopefully  they ll very quickly come up with the answer  But until they do  the planes are grounded michael barbaroAll of this looks very bad for Boeing  obviously  And it seems to stem from this original motivation  as you described it  to avoid classifying this new energy efficient plane that would compete against Airbuses as fundamentally different from older models of the 737 that would require expensive training of the pilots  even though a very crucial part of the plane was different natalie kitroeffThat s right  This motivation to keep this plane as similar as possible to its predecessor permeated the entire engineering process  Remember  this is how Boeing needs to compete with Airbus  It s also raising questions about the entire process for certifying aircraft in the United States  There is renewed scrutiny on the closeness between the F A A  and Boeing  The F A A  and Boeing work together to certify planes  The F A A  actually relies heavily on Boeing employees to help certify its aircraft michael barbaroAnd is that basically industry practice  Companies that make these planes work with the Federal Aviation Administration on the approval process natalie kitroeffThat s exactly right michael barbaroHmm natalie kitroeffI mean  folks were talking about this  right  But nobody was kind of raising red flags  I mean  it wasn t like people were up in arms about the way that this certification system works  But now there s been two crashes of the same model in less than five months  And we re hearing more and more from regulators and former regulators about how this close relationship may be too cozy michael barbaroNatalie  what do we know about the role that Boeing s employees played specifically in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max natalie kitroeffWe know that Boeing plays a critical role in helping to certify its aircraft  And we are learning more and more about the role that it played in the case of the 737 Max  The Seattle Times recently reported that not only was the F A A  relying heavily on Boeing in this case  but that Boeing itself was turning out an analysis that was downplaying the potential risks of a software system that is now at issue after these two crashes michael barbaroHmm natalie kitroeffThe F A A   like any federal agency  has a limited budget  And there s a reason why it would want to rely on the people who are most informed about the inner workings of increasingly complex aircraft in order to determine whether that plane is airworthy  You can see why you would need a relationship  and one where there is a lot of information sharing  right  Because the one side can t employ as many people as Boeing does  And the other side has a ton of expertise  But is that relationship too close michael barbaroRight  And there seems to be a lot of trust at the center of this system you re describing that allows Boeing to basically be like a co regulator of itself  And the most important trust involved here seems to be that a business will always put safety above profits  And I guess the question here is whether in a system with that much trust  that balance could get out of whack  and safety might lose out to profits  And the only way we would know that is when there s a tragedy or two tragedies natalie kitroeffBoeing doesn t want planes to crash  So their motivations are  in many ways  exactly aligned with their customers   But what s emerged after these two crashes   I mean  you heard the pilots  They said this was a breach of trust michael barbaroRight natalie kitroeffI think a lot of people are feeling that right now  that feeling of questioning of this process  And this isn t to say anything about Boeing s motivations  We are at the very beginning of investigating these two flights  and we do not want to rush to conclusions  But you re asking the questions that the people at the front line of this industry  the pilots  the crew  they re asking that right now  How do we regain trust in Boeing  And how do we know for sure that we are being told everything we need to know in order to fly these planes michael barbaroWe ve been talking about trust  the trust that the F A A  had in Boeing  that the airlines  their pilots and crews had or didn t have in this plane  But I m wondering now about the trust that we  as the flying public  have in these planes  And it s kind of hard to imagine wanting to fly on a 737 Max anytime soon  Let s say that the software gets fixed  And Boeing and the F A A   through their certification process  they all sign off on everything being safe  Why should we trust them after that  Why should we trust them  kind of  ever natalie kitroeffI think that coming up with the software fix is manageable for Boeing  an industrial juggernaut that has dealt with these issues before  And you ll remember  the 787 Dreamliner was grounded for three months in 2013  when it had battery fire problems michael barbaroAnd that was a Boeing plane natalie kitroeffRight  a Boeing plane  And we all fly on it  It s possible that people will be wary right now  But Boeing has the capacity to fix this thing and probably will  The bigger question is whether these two tragedies lead to a more wholesale transformation in the process for regulating the aircraft manufacturers in this country  What  if anything  is going to change in the process by which we determine  in the United States  that planes are safe to fly  music michael barbaroNatalie  thank you very much natalie kitroeffThank you  Michael One area of focus is whether the training procedures on Boeing s jet  greenlighted by the Federal Aviation Administration  left pilots unprepared to deal with new software on the plane  When the plane was introduced  Boeing believed that pilots who had flown an earlier model didn t need additional simulator training and regulators agreed  The F A A  didn t change those rules after the Lion Air crash in October and there are no plans to do so now Although the investigations are continuing  preliminary evidence and data suggest potential similarities between the crashes  raising questions about the new software on which pilots weren t trained  Evidence at the Ethiopia crash site suggests there could have been a problem with the software  an automated system designed to help avoid a stall  which has also come up in the Lion Air disaster When Airbus announced in 2010 that it would introduce a new fuel efficient and cost effective plane  Boeing rushed to get out its own version  The strategy depended heavily on building a plane that worked essentially the same as the previous generation  Regulators agreed that it was a derivative model and that it didn t require additional simulator training  a significant savings for airlines ImageJim Albaugh and Nicole Piasecki  Boeing executives at the time  talking to reporters in 2011 about plans for the Max  Today  there is only one simulator specifically designed for the Max in the United States CreditStephen Brashear Associated PressFor many new airplane models  pilots train for hours on giant  multimillion dollar machines  on the ground versions of cockpits that mimic the flying experience and teach them new features  But in the case of the Max  many pilots with 737 experience learned about the plane on an iPad  We would have liked to have had a simulator  from the start  said Jon Weaks  the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association   But it wasn t practical  because it wasn t built yet  As Boeing pushed to get the plane done  flights simulators designed specifically for the Max weren t ready  Greg Bowen  the training and standards chair at the Southwest pilots association  said that senior leadership at the carrier told him the engineering data necessary to design simulator software was still being finalized right up until the plane was nearly completed  They were building the airplane and still designing it   Mr  Bowen said   The data to build a simulator didn t become available until about when the plane was ready to fly  When United was set to take delivery of the 737 Max in 2017  a group of pilots put together training materials without ever flying the aircraft or a full simulator  James LaRosa  a 737 captain and union official who helped lead the training group  said he flew to a Boeing training center in Seattle to learn about the new plane on a mock cockpit that didn t move like typical simulators In addition to a two hour iPad training course from Boeing  he and colleagues used their experience in the cockpit to create a 13 page handbook on the differences between the Max and its predecessor  including changes to displays and the engines  The training materials did not mention the new software that later became a focus of the Lion Air crash investigation ImageIndonesian rescue personnel recovering the wreckage of an engine from the Lion Air flight CreditUlet Ifansasti Getty ImagesImageIndonesian emergency workers after the crash of a 737 Max 8 last year CreditUlet Ifansasti Getty Images When you find out that there are systems on it that are wildly different that affect the performance of the aircraft  having a simulator is part of a safety culture   said Dennis Tajer  a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union and a 737 pilot   It can be the difference between a safe  recoverable flight and one that makes the newspapers  Boeing said in a statement that  the 737 Max was certified in accordance with the identical F A A  requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives   The F A A  s aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs   the regulator said in a statement After the Lion Air crash that killed all 189 people aboard  the new software on the plane became an area of focus for investigators and pilots The new engines on the planes were bigger  part of Boeing s competitive push to make it more fuel efficient  To compensate for the different aerodynamics that were the result of the larger engines  Boeing installed a system  known as MCAS  that automatically pushes the plane s nose down in certain circumstances  A central concern in the Lion Air disaster is that the system may have malfunctioned  based on faulty sensor readings After the crash  it was clear that pilots of the 737 Max had not been fully informed about the new software  Shortly after Thanksgiving  pilot unions from Southwest and American met separately with Boeing officials  The unions wanted answers  The first thing we talked about was the break of trust   said Mr  Tajer  the American pilot union spokesman   We called it disrespectful  According to Mr  Tajer  Boeing officials told American s pilots that they hadn t mentioned the new software because they didn t want to  inundate  them with information The union told Boeing that it was now demanding simulators for its pilots   We don t really care what the F A A  requires   Mr  Tajer said  recalling the meeting Pilots at American Airlines  who began asking for simulators for the new model as soon as they started flying the planes  ramped up their requests after the Lion Air crash ImageFlowers left at the site in Ethiopia where a Max 8 crashed last weekend  Pilots in the United States have expressed frustration that they weren t told earlier about a new automated system on the plane CreditMulugeta Ayene Associated PressBoeing officials promised American and Southwest pilots a software fix within several weeks  but added that extra training was not necessary  Notifying the pilots of the nature of the software fix and how it would function would be enough The airlines agreed  After those meetings  the pilots from both unions said that they were certain that they could keep flying the plane safely  even without simulators  Once they had been told how the new software worked  they believed they had  all the information on the system and the ability to interrupt it if it went afoul   said Mr  Tajer Representative Peter A  DeFazio  Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House transportation committee  said he asked F A A  officials after the Lion Air crash why more substantial training was not required  I said   This is essentially a different airplane  and how is it that it was certified without requiring pilot retraining    Mr  DeFazio recalled  He said the F A A  defended what had been decided as the work of pilots and others who  came to a consensus decision  ImageA Max 9 being built in Renton  Wash   two years ago  Boeing has halted deliveries of new Max planes CreditJason Redmond ReutersThe F A A  bases its rules for training around the typical experience of a pilot in the United States  explaining that  the average caliber  skill and training of U S  pilots is extensive  with countless hours of flight time and training both on the flight deck and in simulators   But other countries tend to follow the lead of the United States in terms of training  leaving less experienced pilots potentially vulnerable  Overseas  pilots in some cases have a tiny fraction of the training that our pilots have   Mr  DeFazio said   Our pilots may all be good enough to recover with an MCAS problem with a bad sensor  After the Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people  Boeing made calls to airlines  reassuring them that it was taking the situation seriously  Still  it said  it had full faith in the plane  We are confident in the safety of the 737 Max   Mr  Muilenburg wrote in an email to employees on Monday   and in the work of the men and women who design and build it  The tragedy consumed Mr  Trump  according to a person familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations  He talked about it repeatedly and brought up other major aviation disasters  including the 2015 Germanwings crash  which left 150 dead after the pilot deliberately slammed into the French Alps After his first call with Mr  Muilenburg  Mr  Trump was leaning against banning the flights  according to the person  But aides urged the president to intervene  telling him that the United States couldn t be the only country to allow the planes to keep flying Instead of letting the F A A  announce the grounding  Mr  Trump blurted it out during an event about drug trafficking   The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern   he said  He added of Boeing   They are working very  very hard right now and hopefully they ll very quickly come up with the answer  but until they do  the planes are grounded  It is unclear when the planes will start flying again  The company is expected to roll out a software fix by April  which will modify features of the jet around the automated system But Boeing isn t planning to overhaul its training procedures  And neither the F A A   nor the European Union Aviation Safety Agency  are proposing additional simulator training for pilots  according to a person familiar with the deliberations  Instead  the regulators and Boeing agree that the best way to inform pilots about the new software is through additional computer based training  which can be done on their personal computers While many pilots in the United States are still committed to the plane  they are pushing for Boeing to be more proactive ImageA Max 8 landing at Tulsa International Airport in Oklahoma  American  Southwest and United are the three airlines in the United States with Max planes in their fleets

American Airlines pilots union and a 737 captain   But I would like to see the fix done and have a full briefing from the manufacturer about what this thing is really going to do and how it s going to do it  And airlines are getting flight simulators  even if they aren t required by regulators  One flight simulator maker has received 40 orders It will be months before pilots in the United States can use them Hours after the Ethiopian Airlines crash  Mr  Tajer  the American Airlines union spokesman  spoke with the carrier and asked for an update on the simulator request  The reply  One had been ordered  and pilots would be able to train on it by the end of this year United Airlines  the world s third largest carrier  was told that it has to wait until 2020 for one  Today  there is only one simulator specifically designed for the Max in the United States 
WASHINGTON    Wonder Woman   the 2017 film that Steven Mnuchin helped produce before becoming Treasury secretary  hauled in about  90 million at the box office in China  It was the film s most successful international market and a roaring success for an American superhero export  But because of China s strict laws for foreign films  the studio behind the movie  Warner Bros   received just a small fraction of those revenues Now  as Treasury secretary and one of the lead negotiators in trade talks with China  Mr  Mnuchin has been personally pushing Beijing to give the American film industry greater access to its markets   a change that could be highly lucrative to his former industry  While Mr  Mnuchin divested from his Hollywood film production company after joining the Trump administration  he maintains ties to the industry through his wife  the actress and filmmaker Louise Linton In 2017  Mr  Mnuchin sold his interest in the company  StormChaser Partners  to Ms  Linton  who at the time was his fiancée  In his 2018 disclosure  which was obtained from the Treasury Department through a records request by The New York Times  StormChaser is listed as one of Ms  Linton s assets Since they are now married  government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr  Mnuchin  And while the documents show that Mr  Mnuchin sold his stake to Ms  Linton for  1 million to  2 million  he is now owed that same amount  in addition to interest  from StormChaser in 2026  according to the 2018 form  Read Mr  Mnuchin s financial disclosure documents here  Mr  Mnuchin s remaining ties to the film industry are raising questions among ethics officials and lawmakers about whether a conflict of interest exists  At a congressional hearing on Thursday  Mr  Mnuchin was questioned by a top Senate Democrat about those continuing financial ties  The Office of Government Ethics still has not certified his 2018 financial disclosure  which is the first since his marriage to Ms  Linton Access to China s film market has not been a primary issue in the trade talks  which have focused largely on Beijing s treatment of foreign companies  including its requirement that firms hand over valuable technology  its barriers to foreign business and its subsidies to Chinese firms But Mr  Mnuchin has championed more equitable treatment of American films in China  viewing existing restrictions on foreign entertainment as part of the problematic behavior the Trump administration is trying to correct Under the current system  foreign companies must secure Chinese partners to enter China s market and they are restricted in how much they can earn as part of the arrangements  China applies a strict quota for the number of Hollywood films it lets into its theaters  For most box office showings  Chinese companies take in 75 percent of all revenue  leaving the remainder to Hollywood  To operate in the tightly managed Chinese entertainment sector  American companies have also had to form a vast network of complicated ties with Chinese state owned firms Since the trade talks began last year  film lobbyists have met with Mr  Mnuchin s top deputies  as well as with officials from the Commerce Department and the office of the United States Trade Representative  Mr  Mnuchin has been especially responsive to lobbying from the film industry  according to people familiar with the discussions  given his background and understanding of the challenges that American moviemakers face in China At a congressional hearing last month  Robert Lighthizer  President Trump s top trade negotiator  said increasing the revenue share earned by American film companies in China was  absolutely  a priority in the talks  and he highlighted Mr  Mnuchin s role  Secretary Mnuchin has been very much involved   Mr  Lighthizer added   He of course knows a great deal about that industry  a lot more than I do  On Thursday  Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee  raised concerns about Mr  Mnuchin s financial ties to the film industry and asked the Treasury secretary whether he had  in fact  really divested himself of the StormChaser asset listed on his disclosure form Mr  Wyden also suggested that the transaction might have been more of a loan to Ms  Linton than a true financial separation from StormChaser  What we have wondered is if there has been an exchange of an asset for a loan rather than a divestment   Mr  Wyden said Mr  Mnuchin declined to discuss details of the transaction  but said that his financial disclosures were certified by career ethics officials in the Treasury Department  I am advised by people at Treasury that I am fully in compliance and I have no ethical issues   Mr  Mnuchin said When asked by reporters after the hearing why his StormChaser ties did not represent a conflict of interest  Mr  Mnuchin said that he would not discuss any specific assets Treasury noted separately that Mr  Mnuchin s disclosure was certified internally on June 27  2018  and that the department was working with the Office of Government Ethics to obtain its certification ImageGal Gadot in a scene from  Wonder Woman   which Mr  Mnuchin helped produce CreditClay Enos Warner Bros  EntertainmentMr  Mnuchin and Ms  Linton  who married in 2017  brought Hollywood glitz to Washington  but their continuing links to the film industry have also brought complications After working for 17 years at Goldman Sachs  Mr  Mnuchin in the last decade became a big name in Hollywood as a film investor  His companies  Dune Entertainment and later RatPac Dune  helped produce and finance dozens of films that were box office smashes in China  including  Avatar    Gravity    Dunkirk    Wonder Woman  and  Ready Player One   Mr  Mnuchin was also a co chairman of Relativity Media  a fledgling Hollywood studio that had a joint venture in China During his confirmation hearing in 2017  Mr  Mnuchin said that Relativity s joint venture in China was  not particularly successful   He said that he was not aware of direct Chinese investment in the business but that  in the future  Chinese investments in Hollywood may need to be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  which the Treasury secretary oversees Mr  Mnuchin agreed to divest from dozens of investments in early 2017  after he was nominated by Mr  Trump  Later that year  he sent a letter of apology to the Office of Government Ethics after appearing to promote one of his movies when he said at an event   Send all your kids to  Lego Batman   This month  the Center for Public Integrity reported that Mr  Mnuchin s most recent financial disclosure  which Treasury approved last June  has yet to be certified by the ethics office  That has raised questions about the reason for the delay Ethics experts have pointed to Mr  Mnuchin s continuing ties to StormChaser Partners as a potential reason for the holdup  It certainly creates a significant appearance issue   said Virginia Canter  a former senior ethics counsel at the Treasury Department   Not just because he previously was in the entertainment business  and may in fact go back into it at some point when he leaves Treasury  but because his spouse appears to have holdings in these films and is part of the film industry and may benefit if favorable terms are negotiated with China  According to a report in The Hollywood Reporter this year  Ms  Linton spends much of her time in Los Angeles  where she has been writing  directing and producing a comedy called  Me  You  Madness   She has also been busy reshooting  Serial Daters Anonymous   a 2014 satire that was never released in which she had a starring role  She told the magazine that financing for her films comes from  a variety of investors  While Mr  Mnuchin s role in pressing for the film industry has raised some concerns  there is broad support in the United States to push for changes to China s film regulations  The film industry supports more than two million American jobs  according to industry data  and Hollywood has been a powerful force for exporting American culture around the world  Even if concessions are made in trade negotiations there s a long way to go  because the business environment continues to keep Hollywood from operating on an equal plane   said Aynne Kokas  an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of  Hollywood Made in China  Still  the China market has been lucrative for Hollywood  offering a rapidly growing box office and a ready source of financing  at a time when the American industry faces pressure from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime and a saturated film market in the United States Hollywood has found the lure of the China market irresistible  even though operating in China means enduring censorship and unfair treatment as well as working with state owned companies Hollywood has long been a victim of rampant piracy in China  including from bootleg DVDs distributed in back alley stores and online streaming services  But China has done a better job of policing these forms of piracy in recent years as its own industry has developed  said Stanley Rosen  a professor at the University of Southern California  As their films are being pirated  they are now beginning to enforce copyright protections of their own films   Mr  Rosen said Despite better intellectual property protection  the playing field for foreign companies is far from even  China still limits the number of Hollywood films that can appear in its movie theaters  the dates those films can appear and the distributors they can use to reach the theaters  And Chinese censors only welcome films that show their country in a positive light   censorship that has led American studios to make editorial choices like depicting North Koreans as villains rather than the Chinese  or smashing the Taj Mahal rather than the Great Wall of China Even for box office hits  Hollywood studios receive a quarter of ticket proceeds  with the rest going to Chinese partners  Increasing that to the global average  which is around 40 percent  is one of the industry s biggest requests  Last month  Mr  Lighthizer said that this was a  key issue  that  had not been resolved  in negotiations Mr  Lighthizer also described restrictions on distribution as complicated  saying   There should be some changes there  too  but what we haven t done is challenge control  It s not something we want to bring into this  the idea of challenging control in China  In another congressional hearing this week  Mr  Lighthizer reiterated that the United States was renegotiating the amount of Chinese box office revenue shared with American firms  saying it was a  very unfair situation  Like many other American industries  Hollywood has grown frustrated with China s pattern of promising to open its film market  only to fail to do so  As early as 2001  the World Trade Organization urged China to open up its film market  An agreement between the two countries governing China s rules for Hollywood films expired in February 2017  and it has not been renegotiated Some lawmakers hope that Mr  Mnuchin and Mr  Lighthizer will be able to finally change that  This is our opportunity to even the playing field here to some extent   Representative Judy Chu  Democrat of California and a member of the Ways and Means Committee  said in an interview   The U S  film industry clearly has been at a disadvantage  
At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war  Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Friday Where is the United States at war  It s a hard question to answer  Inevitably though  at least in the last four years  this sentence has changed little  American troops are fighting in Iraq  Afghanistan and Syria  But with a steady stream of airstrikes  militant deaths  alleged civilian casualties and two American troops killed in Eastern Africa since 2017  another country has since crept onto the list  Somalia On Sunday  my colleagues Eric Schmitt and Charlie Savage published a story about the escalating war there against the Al Qaeda affiliated group Shabab  and how the number of American airstrikes in the country have steadily increased under the Trump administration  In 2018 alone  there were 47 strikes that killed 326 people  And 2019 is already on pace to exceed last year s tallies And despite documentation that quantifies the Pentagon s efforts in Somalia  there is no public record of the C I A  s activities in the country  including if it has its own drone program to search for and to kill Shabab militants  But the agency is undoubtedly intertwined with the military s efforts in the region  according to defense officials  often piggybacking off American outposts and American backed militias to support their own clandestine activities How did we get here  Like most chapters of the United States  counterterrorism campaign that began in the aftermath of the Sept  11 attacks  the new war in Somalia started with a small influx of 50 American troops in 2016 and has ballooned to 500  now spread across the country in small outposts and aided by thousands of forces from neighboring African countries including Kenya and Uganda Trump Administration Steps Up Air War in SomaliaEven as the Trump administration pulls back from counterinsurgency operations elsewhere  airstrikes targeting Islamist militants in Somalia have soared March 10  2019The last time the United States had an enduring military presence in Somalia was in 1993  but that ended after 18 Americans troops were killed in the capital  Mogadishu  in a violent gun battle  known as the Black Hawk Down incident  Two helicopters were shot down  and their pilots  bodies were dragged through the streets Since then  the Shabab has grown and spread across the country  pledging allegiance to Al Qaeda in 2012 and threatening Somalia s fragile government  In response  the Pentagon ramped up American drone strikes and Special Operations raids  Now as President Trump seeks to withdraw some of the roughly 7 000 American troops on the African continent to ready for great power conflict with Russia and China  the war in Somalia has turned into a small version of Afghanistan Special Operations troops patrol in mine resistant vehicles  heavily armed gunships patrol the night sky and  despite a torrent of attacks and militant body counts often championed in

TRIESTE  Italy   For centuries  this cosmopolitan port city at the northern tip of Italy s Adriatic coast acted as a geographic pivot point between empires  Then  for nearly 70 years  Trieste s geopolitical star dimmed and its old world mishmash of central European cultures grew stale  like an old strudel in one of its elegant cafes Now  courtesy of a rising China  Trieste appears ready to return to the center of a realigning world This week  President Xi Jinping of China arrives in Rome for a state visit in which Italy is expected to become the first Group of 7 nation to participate in China s vast One Belt  One Road infrastructure project  The symbolism is striking   a powerful China drives a crack in the economic alliance that once dominated the globe and delivers a major blow to a Trump administration that has been critical of the Belt and Road Initiative For Italy  the deal would open the country to greater Chinese infrastructure investment  particularly in ports like Trieste  Officials here say they expect Beijing backed conglomerates  such as the China Communications Construction Company  to bid hundreds of millions of euros for infrastructure concessions ImageThe old port in Trieste  For China  having a toehold in one of Europe s historic ports would bring favorable customs conditions  a faster trade route to the heart of the Continent and direct access to railroads for moving its goods into the European Union CreditNadia Shira Cohen for The New York TimesFor China  having a toehold in one of Europe s historic ports would bring favorable customs conditions  a faster trade route to the heart of the Continent and direct access to railroads for moving its goods into the European Union  Fundamentally  what s happening is that the port of Trieste is returning to the logistical role for Europe that it had for the old Austro Hungarian empire   said Zeno D Agostino  the president of the Trieste port authority  whose office is sprinkled with gifts from Chinese delegations and a book about European Chinese cultural relations To walk through Trieste is to witness how the city has already opened to China  Chinese tourists shop for the city s trademark Illy coffee and take pictures with their Huawei phones of the elegant Caffè Degli Specchi  A brand new cruise ship  built in nearby shipyards expressly for Chinese passengers  is docked in the central waterfront piazza  preparing to set sail on Marco Polo s path to the Far East Most significant  construction workers in scuba gear have been laying foundations near the site where a new pier is expected to become China s home in the industrial port  In the years after World War II  the Americans held great sway in Trieste  and Washington has now sought  so far unsuccessfully  to stop Italy s deal with Mr  Xi  characterizing the Belt and Road Initiative as an economic and potentially military threat While other members of the European Union  including France and Germany  have also expressed reservations about the deal with China  supporters in Italy say that there is nothing to worry about and that the critics are merely upset that Trieste   and other Italian ports  like Genoa and Palermo   are going to cut in on their business  They reject comparisons to the port of Piraeus in Greece  which China essentially bought  and say Italian law makes such an acquisition or the laying of Chinese debt traps impossible ImageConstruction on a platform at the Trieste port  one of the projects that could benefit from a Chinese Italian economic accord CreditNadia Shira Cohen for The New York TimesMichele Geraci  an Italian economic development minister who is running the negotiations with Beijing  said in an interview that Chinese ships carrying materials from home or its vast network of interests in Africa through the Suez Canal simply needed to get their goods to central European markets as quickly as possible  Trieste meets that requirement swiftly   he said Italian officials say their American counterparts initially seemed disinterested in the deal  Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio  the leader of the Five Star Movement  has made several trips to China in recent months  nearly signing the accord during a November visit to Beijing  they said  After the fact  American diplomats began making their case  but the Italians said the deal was noticeably not on the American radar during recent high level meetings in Washington But this month  Garrett Marquis  spokesman for the American national security adviser  John R  Bolton  sharply attacked the deal in a Twitter post and in several interviews  while the National Security Council s official Twitter account also issued a reproach on March 9  Endorsing BRI lends legitimacy to China s predatory approach to investment and will bring no benefits to the Italian people   the tweet stated  referring to the Belt and Road Initiative The Americans have also tried to pressure leaders of the nationalist League party  which is part of the governing coalition in Italy  This month  Trump administration officials and  separately  the former White House official Stephen K  Bannon  met with party leaders  Mr  Bannon said that he had warned his Italian allies in the League against what he called China s  British East India Company model of predatory capitalism  ImageThe Piazza Unità d Italia  the main square in Trieste  Participating in Beijing s vast Belt and Road Initiative would open Italy to greater Chinese infrastructure investment CreditNadia Shira Cohen for The New York TimesAwakened to the growing Chinese influence  American officials have had more success pushing Italy to avoid using the new 5G networks of the Chinese electronics giant Huawei  which Washington warns could be used by Beijing to disrupt and spy on communications networks  In recent days  the Italians have excised any mention of technology and communications from the Belt and Road agreement  people familiar with the negotiations said In Trieste  city leaders are focused on the economic benefits to the port Beyond its convenient location  the city on Monday celebrated the 300th anniversary of Emperor Charles VI of Austria declaring it a  free port   That status still confers special privileges  with no customs charges or time limits on storage for goods If the deal goes through  proponents say they envision Chinese companies working with Italian counterparts  hiring local laborers to assemble imported goods before putting them on trains to the rest of Europe or on ships back to China  If the amount of work and components used measure up to customs requirements  those products could be labeled Made in Italy But some business leaders say that fully embracing the Belt and Road program would bring risks and could complicate efforts to bring other investment to Trieste Vittorio Petrucco  chairman of I CO P  a construction company doing work in the port  said he and a former Microsoft consultant in Trieste  which has a vibrant research sector  had begun exploring his  dream  of building an underwater data center that would cool the servers of American tech

meets that requirement swiftly   he said CreditNadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times I prefer to look West instead of East   Mr  Petrucco said of his project  planned for an area near an old ironworks factory that looms above the pier envisioned for use by the Chinese  He added that both projects would take years to build and worried that all the American opposition and controversy surrounding the Belt and Road agreement would poison the waters for his proposal  It s sad   he said   but there s nothing I can do about it  Roberto Dipiazza  the mayor of Trieste  said that the United States could scuttle the deal if it really wanted to  He said that his city had much to gain from closer ties to China  but that the Chinese had even more to gain from his port s deep harbors  customs benefits and rail yards  We will find a point of agreement between China and the U S    he said  showing off a Make America Great Again cap signed by President Trump that he had received as a gift  Italy  he noted  was caught  in the middle  Some of Trieste s most entrenched political players think Italy is compromised by such a position Giulio Camber  a veteran lawmaker considered by many to be the political boss of Trieste  said he no longer had any interests in the port  and that his opposition to the deal was motivated by his distrust of what he called China s Communist dictatorship As light sliced in through the closed curtains of his office  illuminating his cigarette smoke  gilded furniture and oil paintings  Mr  Camber said the Chinese were behind many of the Turkish businesses exporting goods into the port  Beijing  he said  would feast on the Italians just as they did on the Greeks before them  They are the weakest   he said of the Mediterranean countries Mr  Camber dismissed the local and national assurances about Chinese expansion  saying that Beijing would easily outmaneuver officials in Rome  It s like the world champion in chess playing with a couple of guys who play for fun at the Caffè Degli Specchi   he said  referring to the famous cafe in Trieste s main square  the Piazza Unità d Italia   You can t imagine what the world s best chess player

After Hurricane Sandy flooded Lower Manhattan and caused massive damage to the city s financial center  climate scientists agreed it was only a matter of time before a new superstorm would bring the same kind of damage   or worse That realization  in part  led Mayor Bill de Blasio to embrace an unconventional solution  Make Manhattan bigger To safeguard the area from the effects of climate change  including storm surges and rising sea levels  the city is proposing artificially extending the southern tip of Manhattan The idea would be to use landfill in front of the financial district and South Street Seaport to extend the coastline of the island by as much as 500 feet into the East River  creating a rising berm that would  at its highest point  be well above future sea levels The plan is similar to a 2013 proposal by Mr  de Blasio s predecessor  Michael R  Bloomberg  who called for creating a development  much like Battery Park City  along the East River  which would have been at least partly financed by developers interested in building residential or office towers on the new land But Mr  de Blasio s plan and an accompanying study were short on details  and the mayor said the city did not have the estimated  10 billion it would take to pay for it  It would also have to go through environmental reviews and would be subject to input from the community  all obstacles that could alter or block the plan ImageThe plan calls for extending Manhattan s coastline  which would create a rising berm that would  at its highest point  be well above future sea levels CreditNYC Mayor s OfficeThe mayor said the project should be financed by the federal government  which he said was unlikely as long as President Trump was in office  given Mr  Trump s skeptical view of climate change Mr  de Blasio initially revealed the proposal in an online essay posted by New York Magazine on Wednesday night  headlined  My New Plan to Climate Proof Lower Manhattan   He wrapped the plan in the cloak of the Green New Deal  the proposal for a massive federal program to finance alternative energy technology and other initiatives aimed at building an ecologically sustainable economy  championed by  among others  Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Mr  de Blasio  a Democrat  has been toying with the idea of running for president  and since the start of the year he has made bold announcements aimed at gaining national attention  Earlier this year  he announced what he said was a universal health care system for city residents  but on closer scrutiny it amounted to a relatively small increase in the budget for the city hospital system The climate proposal  although couched in planet saving terms  was largely a variation of earlier plans Mr  de Blasio said on Thursday that he did not know what would go on the new land created under his plan  He said that it might be open space and parks or that it could also contain buildings  Our focus is not private sector development as it was  in the previous administration  Mr  de Blasio said at a news conference on West Street   Our focus is on resiliency  He called his plan  audacious   adding   We had to come to grips with the sheer magnitude of what had to be done  ImageMr  de Blasio s plan is similar to a plan proposed in 2013 by the former mayor  Michael R  Bloomberg CreditJohn Taggart for The New York TimesMargaret Chin  a councilwoman who represents Lower Manhattan  said she was  sounding the alarm  about the potential for development on any new land that is created  You want to extend the shore line to protect the inland and not allow private developers to seize the opportunity to build tall buildings and take all the views   said Ms  Chin  The area should remain as open space and the federal government should pay for resiliency measures  she added Mr  de Blasio s plan also included some less ambitious elements for which the city has the financing  The city will spend  165 million to elevate the wharf and esplanade in Battery Park and to create a protective berm at the back of the park  And the city committed spending  200 million to build what officials called  flip up barriers  along a nearly mile long stretch of shoreline north of the Brooklyn Bridge  which could be activated to block a storm surge Construction of both those projects would begin in 2021  They re certainly right to identify the climate and flooding risks to New York City and to Lower Manhattan  but I question the extent they re considering the impact on the rest of the city   said Nilda Mesa  a former director of the Mayor s Office of Sustainability under Mr  de Blasio  who is now an adjunct professor at Columbia University   Water goes where it will and you cannot contain it  If you re going to keep it from coming ashore in one place it still has to move and what does that mean for Brooklyn  Queens and New Jersey and the Bronx  In pointing out the need for the plan  Mr  de Blasio emphasized the importance of Lower Manhattan for the city and the country  citing the area s  60 billion worth of property  and characterizing it as  one of the core centers of the American economy  that contains one out of every 10 jobs in New York City  The security of Lower Manhattan should be a national priority   the mayor said But Francisco Moya  a city councilman from Queens  called the city s resiliency planning too  Manhattan centric   It can t be a tale of two cities  The outer boroughs should not suffer because of rich development happening in more affluent areas   Mr  Moya said in an interview   The people of Queens pay taxes and we should not be ignored when it comes to the issue of climate change  
WASHINGTON   No issue animated the Democrats  2018 congressional campaigns like health care and the promises to expand access to insurance and to lower costs  But as House Democrats sit down to draft their vision of governance in the coming weeks  lawmakers find themselves badly divided on the issue that delivered their majority Centrists from swing districts  with the tacit support of Speaker Nancy Pelosi  favor incremental moves to shore up the Affordable Care Act and to lower the out of pocket costs of prescription drugs and medical care  They are pushing a variety of measures  such as shutting down cheap  short term insurance plans that do not cover pre existing medical conditions and allowing people to buy into Medicare at age 50 or 55  We have very practical solutions that we can implement immediately   said Representative Kim Schrier  Democrat of Washington  who is also a pediatrician   We don t have the luxury of time right now to wait for a full overhaul of our health care system  But they are butting up against an aggressive and expanding group of more than 100 outspoken Democrats   as well as at least four of the party s presidential candidates   who want to do just that  upend the whole system with a single government insurance plan for all Americans   the old concept of single payer  now called Medicare for all  I reject the idea that single payer is impossible   said Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  Democrat of New York The fight will play out in the coming weeks as the new House majority assembles its first budget  a policy document that will not hold the force of law but will carry significant political weight  revealing Democrats  intentions not only on health care but on taxation  climate change  Social Security and other hot button issues as well  But more than any other subject  Democrats  achievements or failures on health care may well define them as they try to defend their fragile majority next year  Health care was on the ballot   Ms  Pelosi declared in November   and health care won  The idea of Medicare for all is immensely contentious  It would greatly expand the federal role in health care  Critics say it would require a big increase in federal spending  and proponents have not said how they would pay for it  Some versions of Medicare for all could wipe out much of the health insurance industry and replace employer sponsored health plans that now cover more than 155 million Americans  Supporters say the proposal would guarantee universal coverage and put health care on a budget  reducing what consumers and employers spend  But insurance companies  along with many hospitals and doctors  are waging a vigorous campaign against it  believing that it would reduce the payments they receive for providing care Image Social Security didn t pass overnight  Medicare didn t pass overnight   said Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  who is a proponent of Medicare for all CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesMs  Pelosi cannot afford to put moderate freshmen in Trump friendly districts on the spot by putting Medicare for all up to a vote  Most people receive health care from their employer   said Representative Scott Peters  Democrat of California and a vice chairman for the New Democrat Coalition  a centrist group   They do not want to replace it with an untested government system  But that view is being challenged from some surprising corners of the party  Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan and no one s idea of an upstart firebrand  is now a champion of the Medicare for All Act  She said the government was already delivering health care to significant areas of the population   the elderly  the poor  service members  children and veterans  We ve got Medicare  we ve got Children s Health Insurance  and now it s time for everybody   said Ms  Dingell  whose husband  John  and his father before him  pressed for universal health care when they served in Congress  Before her husband died last month  she said  he told her to  bring it over the finish line  The debate reflects how much the political climate around health care has changed since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010  Former President Barack Obama had promoted the idea of a public option   a government run health program to compete with private insurance on a federally run insurance marketplace   but moderate Democrats balked  and it was not included in the final law Senator Bernie Sanders  independent of Vermont  almost single handedly put the idea of Medicare for all on the agenda during his 2016 presidential campaign  Since then  the concept has become a kind of litmus test for liberals  Republicans  dismissal of it as socialism has only emboldened the new wave of liberal freshman Democrats in the House Backers of Medicare for all say that  if framed correctly around saving health care costs  it can appeal to voters in more moderate districts ImageSenator Bernie Sanders  independent of Vermont  almost single handedly put Medicare for all on the agenda during his 2016 presidential campaign CreditErin Schaff The New York Times Progressives have done a very good job making the moral case for Medicare for all   said Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California   What we now need to do is make the economic case  But with Republicans in charge of the White House and the Senate  the centrists argue that Congress needs to start with more incremental initiatives that could be slipped into larger bills  such as restoring money to enroll people in health plans on the Affordable Care Act s exchanges  Other bills have bipartisan support  a measure drafted by Senator Susan Collins  Republican of Maine  would create state based reinsurance programs to help pay large health insurance claims  thus lowering premiums on the act s exchanges  After years of damage done to the A C A  from past Republican Congresses and the administration  we must start by reversing the sabotage   leaders of the New Democrat Coalition wrote in a letter to the chairmen of three House committees responsible for health legislation Ms  Pelosi has publicly stayed out of the fight  but with hearings on Medicare for all and other proposals scheduled in the coming weeks  that stance may not be sustainable  People close to her say she has serious reservations about the single payer bill and believes the nation can achieve the goal of universal coverage at a more manageable cost by building on the framework of the Affordable Care Act  which she worked tirelessly to secure in 2010 Polls show the idea of a government sponsored plan is broadly popular  the Kaiser Family Foundation  which tracks attitudes on health care  reported in January that 56 percent of respondents were somewhat or strongly in favor of a plan such as Medicare for all  in which all Americans would get their health care from the government  Even more   roughly three fourths   were somewhat or strongly in favor of allowing people to buy into various government health plans When respondents were asked what they wanted Congress to work on  they prioritized keeping protections for people with pre existing medical conditions and lowering prescription drug costs ahead of enforcing Medicare for all  And the polls show support for Medicare for all falls off when people are asked or told about details of the plans  including possible tax increases to pay for it Even so  Adam Green  a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee  a liberal advocacy group  said that support for Medicare for all had become  a mainstream position  among Democrats ImageFor Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who must bring her fractious caucus together  the Medicare for all debate is politically perilous CreditErin Schaff The New York Times I don t think the split is as much between progressives and more conservative Democrats   Mr  Green said   I actually think the bigger split is between Democrats who just ran and had competitive races in 2018 and a bunch of old timers who didn t experience the dynamic of 2018 and are still operating in yesteryear  where Medicare for all was seen as more of a fringe position  Many Democrats focused their election campaigns around protecting people with pre existing conditions  and they want to move quickly to votes on proposals to do that   in part to test Republicans who made similar pledges during their campaigns  The full House has yet to vote on legislation on pre existing conditions  though in the first 10 days of the new Congress  it voted twice to intervene in a lawsuit that threatens to eliminate the Affordable Care Act s protections for people with such conditions The three House committees with jurisdiction over health care   Energy and Commerce  Ways and Means  and Oversight and Reform   have channeled their energies into numerous hearings on how to lower prescription drug costs  how to expand coverage and protect people with pre existing conditions and how to override actions by the Trump administration Legislation is coming  Democrats are considering restricting the sales of short term insurance policies  approved by the Trump administration  that do not have to comply with the Affordable Care Act  which means they do not have to provide essential health benefits and can discriminate against those with pre existing conditions  Democrats are also looking for ways to cooperate with Republicans on proposals to lower prescription drug prices and to outlaw tactics used by brand name companies to delay competition from generics Hearings on Medicare for all will begin as early as April  according to Representative Pramila Jayapal  Democrat of Washington  who is leading the push for the Medicare for All Act Under the bill sponsored by Ms  Jayapal and Ms  Dingell  the secretary of health and human services would establish a  national health budget   specifying the total amount to be spent each year  and a national fee schedule for health care providers  Republicans have recently been demanding hearings on it  in the belief that they can score political points by showing that the proposal would be immensely expensive and disruptive Ms  Dingell said she intended to travel the country to push for the proposal  For her  it is carrying on a family legacy  Her husband s father  John Dingell Sr   introduced the first universal health care bill in 1943 when he served in Congress  when the younger John Dingell was elected in 1955  he took up the cause and presided 10 years later when Congress passed the law enacting Medicare  A self described pragmatist  Ms  Dingell acknowledged that the current bill may be only the beginning of a longer conversation  Social Security didn t pass overnight   she said   Medicare didn t pass overnight  
WASHINGTON   In announcing the United States  annual list of the world s worst human rights violations  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this past week singled out South Sudan and Nicaragua for government sanctioned atrocities against their own people Over the past year in South Sudan  Mr  Pompeo said   military forces waged sexual violence against civilians based on their political allegiances and their ethnicity   In Nicaragua  he said  when citizens peacefully protested Social Security benefits  they were met with sniper fire  But the Department of Homeland Security has sought to limit the number of immigrants who left South Sudan or Nicaragua for safety  seeking to temporarily live and work legally in the United States The apparent contradiction shows the Trump administration s competing priorities and how they affect foreigners facing government corruption and violence Even as homeland security has sought to tighten American borders and strictly enforce immigration laws  the State Department is highlighting some of the very systematic abuses that have sent people fleeing to the United States That  perfectly illustrates the unfairness inherent in this administration s approach to temporary protected status   said Ahilan Arulanantham  the senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California  referring to a program that gives immigrants short term residency  He is representing plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the administration s efforts to pull those protections from immigrants Homeland security officials defended its approach to limit   and in many cases revoke   temporary protected status on a country by country basis The policy  first enacted in 1990  allowed people from countries suffering from war  natural disasters  epidemic or  extraordinary and temporary conditions  to live and work in the United States until their homelands stabilized  The Trump administration has sought to restrict it  saying the protections have allowed immigrants to gain long term residency One homeland security official said the policy was never intended to give permanent relief to immigrants  who could otherwise apply for refugee grants or benefit from American political pressure or direct intervention on their home countries  The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a policy that is being challenged in court An estimated 2 500 Nicaraguans are living in the United States under temporary protected status and have been ordered to leave  adjust their immigration status or face deportation  They have been given a reprieve as a federal court in California considers their case  along with immigrants from El Salvador  Haiti  Sudan  Honduras and Nepal who are also challenging the administration s deportation order  which they say is racially motivated Temporary protected status was first opened to Nicaraguans in 1999 after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch  and extended for years afterward  As part of its decision to withdraw the protections  homeland security officials concluded that conditions are now safe enough in Nicaragua for the immigrants to return The State Department report  however  found that clashes in Nicaragua that began last April between the police and protesters have so far killed 325 people and injured 2 000 more  Hundreds have been illegally detained and tortured  and more than 52 000 exiled  the report found  Some of those who were detained were raped by government officials  lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender as well as indigenous people were attacked  Human rights deteriorated markedly during the year   the report on Nicaragua concluded The disparity between the two agencies  assessments of South Sudan is slightly blurrier ImageA funeral

who were already in the United States before January 2016 to remain for another 18 months  It was the second time since temporary protected status  commonly referred to as T P S   was granted to South Sudan in 2011 that the United States limited its extension to only some of the immigrants   The first  more limited extension of the temporary protections was granted to the country in 2017  Ms  Nielsen  determined the ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions that support South Sudan s current designation for T P S  continue to exist   the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement But the protections did not extend to those from South Sudan who came to the United States after January 2016  Warring factions in South Sudan reached what the United Nations has described as a fragile peace agreement in 2018  after five years of ethnic violence in South Sudan That has infuriated pro immigration advocates who said hundreds of immigrants who had hoped to win temporary legal residency  and are already in the United States  now face imminent deportation to South Sudan  While the warring parties were able to come to a peace agreement  many people are still being displaced from their homes due to fighting and insecurity and there is substantial work to be done to address the longtime suffering of the South Sudanese people   said Martin Omukuba  who oversees South Sudan policy at the International Rescue Committee  a humanitarian aid group The State Department described a range of atrocities in South Sudan throughout 2018   many at the hands of government officials or security forces They included  rape and gang rape employed as a weapon of war  arbitrary detention and torture  enforced disappearances  explosive remnants of war  forced displacement  the mass destruction of homes and personal property  widespread looting  and use of child soldiers   the department s report found At least 382 000 people have been killed in the conflict in South Sudan  according to the report  which cited figures from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine There is a history of tension between the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security over ending or otherwise limiting temporary protected status for immigrants In a 2017 email exchange obtained by the A C L U   a senior diplomat raised concerns over how homeland security officials would announce the end of the protections for immigrants from Sudan The diplomat  Paul Sutphin  then a senior adviser for the State Department focusing on Sudan and South Sudan  wrote that language about the policy that was being prepared for publication in the Federal Register might encourage  the Sudanese government to take actions that could exacerbate the ongoing armed conflicts in South Sudan  Mr  Sutphin said the Sudanese government could view the language as a  green light  to force displaced people to  deadly conflict affected areas  and pushed homeland security officials to make clear that there was still an internal conflict in South Sudan Asked for comment  Mr  Sutphin said in an email   State and D H S  did not agree on whether the situation on the ground in Sudan merited ending T P S  In a subsequent email  another State Department official said diplomats were caught off guard by the Department of Homeland Security s announcement in September 2017 that it would end temporary protected status for immigrants from Sudan The State Department report released last week found that in Sudan last year   human rights issues included unlawful or arbitrary killings  forced disappearance  torture and arbitrary detention  
Weeks after a deadly crash involving a Boeing plane last October  company officials met separately with the pilot unions at Southwest Airlines and American Airlines  The officials said they planned to update the software for their 737 Max jets  the plane involved in the disaster  by around the end of 2018 It was the last time the Southwest pilots union heard from Boeing  and months later  the carriers are still waiting for a fix  After a second 737 Max crashed  on Sunday in Ethiopia  United States regulators said the software update would be ready by April  Boeing was going to have a software fix in the next five to six weeks   said Michael Michaelis  the top safety official at the American Airlines pilots union and a Boeing 737 captain   We told them   Yeah  it can t drag out   And well  here we are  This delay is now part of the intense scrutiny over Boeing s response after the first air disaster  a Lion Air accident that killed 189 people in Indonesia  The second crash  involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people  bore similarities to the first  pointing to potential problems with the automated system that requires the update The planned fix was  designed to detect the problem   said Jon Weaks  the president of Southwest s pilot union   and keep it from recurring   Boeing officials told Southwest union leaders that they didn t believe any extra training was necessary beyond informing the pilots of how the software fix would function The potential similarities between the two crashes were central to regulators  decision to ground the whole 737 Max line  a family of planes that has been in service for nearly two years  Boeing is now in damage control mode  as carriers cancel flights and try to limit disruptions  Boeing declined to comment for this article Along with the grounding  Boeing has been forced to halt deliveries of the jets  one of its best selling planes  Authorities are trying to determine exactly what went wrong

in the 21st century  After two fatal Max crashes  all of the Max aircraft in the world are believed to have been grounded CreditCreditChang W  Lee The New York TimesThe lawmaker  Representative Peter A  DeFazio of Oregon  the chairman of the House transportation committee  has said he will investigate the Federal Aviation Administration s certification of the 737 Max  including why the regulator did not mandate more substantial training for pilots To qualify to fly the plane  the pilots at American were given a 56 minute iPad training and about a dozen white papers on the differences between the Max aircraft and previous 737 jets  union officials said  Mr  Weaks of Southwest said his members were trained with an e learning module on a company issued iPad that consisted of under three hours of video presentations Both Southwest and American now say they expect to have simulators including the 737 Max systems by the end of this year  American ordered the simulator after the Lion Air crash The meetings last year between Boeing officials and the unions were cordial but direct  The pilots from Southwest and American who met with Boeing were frustrated that they hadn t been notified of the newly installed software system in the 737 Max planes before the crash in Indonesia  The so called maneuvering characteristics augmentation system  or MCAS  is an automated system intended to prevent the plane from stalling  It was a very frank discussion   said the American union s safety chairman  Mr  Michaelis   This is to our knowledge the first time pilots were not informed of a major system on an airplane that could affect flight controls  The pilots demanded more information about the system  Mr  Michaelis said it had been mentioned once in the appendix of the official aircraft manual  but without any explanation about what it was or did In response to the pilots  request  Mr  Michaelis said  Boeing concurred  The company has since provided the American pilots with basic information about MCAS  but it hasn t updated the official manual with a full explanation about how it works Mr  Michaelis said Boeing had partly attributed the delay to the recent government shutdown  which caused a backlog at the F A A  Daniel K  Elwell  the acting administrator of the F A A   said on Wednesday that the 35 day partial government shutdown that stretched from December until late January  did not cause any delay in work on the software  For days after the Ethiopian crash  Boeing and the F A A  stood by the safety of the plane  As regulators around the world grounded the plane  the F A A  resisted doing the same ImageA Boeing 737 Max 8 at Miami International Airport on Thursday  Some of the jets were allowed to fly to be better situated for long term parking CreditJoe Raedle Getty ImagesMr  DeFazio said he stepped out of a hearing on Wednesday morning to speak with Mr  Elwell about the plane  Mr  DeFazio said Mr  Elwell assured him there was no cause for alarm Within hours  President Trump announced the Max would be grounded  One of my staff  her phone went  bing  and there it was   Mr  DeFazio said Mr  Elwell and the F A A  s top safety official  Ali Bahrami  visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to brief members of the House and Senate about the agency s decision making after the crash in Ethiopia  Mr  Elwell also made the rounds on morning television shows as his agency continued to face questions about its response to the crash as well as the earlier accident in Indonesia  We re confident in the safety of the airplane   he said on  CBS This Morning    What we don t know is if there s a linkage between those two accidents  and now that we have the new evidence to suggest there very well may be  we grounded the airplanes to find the linkage  Mr  Trump  at the White House on Thursday  said he hoped the Boeing planes would be back in the air soon   They have to figure it out fast   he said   They know that  They re under great pressure  The three American airlines that operate 737 Max aircraft   American and Southwest operate Max 8s and United flies the Max 9   have scrambled to limit any disruptions caused by the groundings  The airlines have shifted other available aircraft to replace the jets  canceled less popular flights to use those aircraft for busier Max routes  and rebooked some fliers on other airlines  Cancellations will vary by the day based on the availability of other aircraft American  which has 24 Max 8 jets  canceled 85 flights out of 6 700 on Thursday  but it was able to limit the disruption by scrapping emptier flights on routes where it could rebook those passengers on later flights  For instance  it canceled flights from Dallas to Sacramento and Tucson  booking those fliers on later planes  and used those aircraft to instead operate busier routes between Miami and New York Southwest  which has 34 Max 8 jets  said it was able to shift enough planes around to cancel just 39 out of its 4 000 scheduled flights on Thursday  And United  which has 14 Max 9 jets  was able to avoid any cancellations from the grounding on Thursday because it shifted many planes from its hub in Denver  where a snowstorm was already disrupting flights There were still some 737 Max jets flying in American skies on Thursday  The F A A  granted the airlines permission to ferry their empty Max jets to new airports for long term parking  American flew its planes from places like Miami  New York and Tampa  Fla   to places like Tulsa  Orlando  Fla   and Mobile  Ala 
Good Monday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Prosecutors and regulators circle BoeingIn the wake of two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max 8 airplane that shared similarities  Boeing finds itself with prosecutors and regulators inspecting its development processes and safety assessments   A grand jury in Washington  D C   issued a subpoena dated March 11   the day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash   seeking documents from at least one person involved in the development of the 737 Max jets  the WSJ reports   The Transportation Department inspector general s office was also reportedly examining the plane s design certification before the second deadly crash   An investigation by The Seattle Times found that the F A A  delegated wide responsibility for the 737 Max safety assessment to Boeing itself  The resulting analysis included  crucial flaws   according to the investigation   And Bloomberg reports that as early as seven years ago  F A A  employees warned that Boeing  had too much sway over safety approvals of new aircraft  Boeing said in a statement on Sunday that  aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs

In his first appearance before a House committee controlled by Democrats  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross faced pointed questions on Thursday about his sworn testimony on his decision last year to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census Democrats at the hearing  held by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  expressed incredulity at Mr  Ross s insistence that he had sought the question at the behest of the Justice Department  an explanation that two federal judges have said was not credible Representative William Clay  a Missouri Democrat  said one explanation of Mr  Ross s deliberations  does not pass the laugh test   and disclosed that a draft of the Justice Department s request had been written by a former member of the Trump administration s political transition team The committee s questioning came ahead of a Supreme Court hearing next month on the legality of the citizenship question  which has been challenged by attorneys general for 17 states  the District of Columbia and a host of cities and counties  Critics say that adding the question will discourage immigrants from filling out the form and will improve Republican political fortunes The census count will determine which states gain or lose seats in the House of Representatives when redistricting begins in 2021 Republicans on Thursday fulminated that Democrats were staging a political sideshow aimed at tainting the Supreme Court hearing  For his part  Mr  Ross rebuffed questions by repeatedly citing a six page memo he used to announce the citizenship question in March 2018  and by largely refusing to elaborate The memo said that the Justice Department needed to know where noncitizens lived to better determine whether the racial or ethnic composition of political districts met the mandates of the 1965 Voting Rights Act  But a federal judge in Manhattan ruled in January that Mr  Ross and his aides clearly had decided to add the question shortly after taking office in February 2017  and that they had recruited Justice Department officials  to launder their request through another agency   that is  to obtain cover for a decision that they had already made  Mr  Ross s efforts to refute that drew scorn from some Democrats  Asked about an email from May 2017 in which he complained about inaction on  my months old request that we include the citizenship question   Mr  Ross said he was actually frustrated over the Justice Department s slowness in telling him whether it needed citizenship data No conclusive alternative explanation for including the question has emerged in lawsuits  But plaintiffs in lawsuits have claimed   and some Democrats suggested on Wednesday   that the real reason for asking census respondents about their citizenship was to frighten noncitizens and even some legal immigrants from filling out the form  That would depress the population count among groups that traditionally vote Democratic  and skew the next reapportionment of the House of Representatives and other political districts in 2021 Noncitizens are counted for reapportionment of the House under the 14th Amendment  which requires that apportioning be based on  the whole number of persons in each state   Mr  Ross said  as court documents already showed  that he had both discussed and received information on the impact of noncitizens on reapportionment  But he said he had not considered that information when considering the citizenship question The citizenship question has been challenged in federal courts in three states  and courts in New York and Maryland have already ruled against its inclusion in the 2020 head count  Judge Jesse M  Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan said Mr  Ross had broken  a veritable smorgasbord  of federal rules  A second ruling in a federal court in Maryland stated that Mr  Ross s decision violated the constitutional requirement to conduct an accurate count of the population because it would depress the response to the census 
Alexandra Rojas was shocked  So was Waleed Shahid The two vocal leaders of Justice Democrats  an advocacy group whose uncompromising style has made it a nuisance among Washington traditionalists  had a meeting request from aides to Senator Elizabeth Warren  who was fresh into her presidential campaign  As Ms  Warren sought to push the party to the left by proposing expansive liberal policy ideas  her team was prepared to seek counsel from organizations that did the same  They want us in their court   Ms  Rojas said   They know that if they want to win  they need to have the support from the grass roots energy  Ms  Warren s willingness to look outside the traditional pool of political aides underscores the extent to which activism and ideology are shaping the makeup of campaign staffs for Democratic candidates  even at the highest levels  Neither Ms  Rojas nor Mr  Shahid received a job offer  but in a crowded field where candidates are looking to stand out  activists fluent in the language of social movements are gaining value as important allies Julián Castro hired as his campaign manager Maya Rupert  a campaign novice who made her name in organizing with the Center for Reproductive Rights and the National Center for Lesbian Rights  Senator Bernie Sanders has expanded his close knit group of strategists and tapped Faiz Shakir  the former political director for the American Civil Liberties Union  to run his new look presidential campaign As the primary process kicks into full swing  some Democrats are bypassing the kind of experienced Washington  wiseguys  who operated in the caldron of beltway politics   famous strategists like David Axelrod  James Carville and  more recently  Robby Mook  Instead  campaigns are increasingly filling senior positions with a new generation of activist driven operatives  whose political formation took place in grass roots movements The shift has resulted in greater staff diversity than in previous cycles  but it has also influenced strategy  according to campaign officials  New voices are joining with election cycle veterans to bring fresh ideas and political approaches to the presidential stage ImageMs  Warren has

political risks  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  Mr  Sanders is emphasizing his personal biography more and engaging in more explicit discussions of racial inequality  Senator Kamala Harris  the California Democrat who has often relied on a trusted group of California advisers  has taken pains to find senior staff members with grass roots credentials as she attempts to fashion herself as the candidate  for the people   The shifts that we re seeing in the Democratic Party are a lot of folks demanding that their leadership take ideas that have been considered on the fringe and push them to the center   said Ms  Rupert  Mr  Castro s campaign manager   And that s the way movements operate  Mr  Castro s campaign is also paying its interns a  15 minimum wage and said it would support any effort among staff members to form a union  And Mr  Sanders s campaign announced last week that its staff would become the first presidential campaign work force to be unionized Kelly Dietrich  the longtime Democratic consultant  said the surge in Democratic voter enthusiasm since President Trump s election has helped issue driven activists become more interested in traditional electoral politics  It has also forced campaigns to take new ideas more seriously  he said  Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker   We re seeing a lot more people across the spectrum  both in terms of diversity and political agenda  step forward and want to make change   said Mr  Dietrich  who founded a campaign training organization called the National Democratic Training Committee  They are  fed up or scared  they are frustrated and are ready to fight back  The Democratic Party needs to bring in these activists  Mr  Dietrich said   so that five years  10 years  15 years down the road  this is the norm  ImageAlexandra Rojas  the 24 year old executive director of Justice Democrats  was asked to meet with Senator Elizabeth Warren s campaign CreditJonathan Bachman ReutersThe shift reflects a growing realization among many Democrats that the party s most fervent energy resides on its left flank  Democrats swept to power in the House in last year s midterm elections  and the most popular members of the party s new class are the women of color who pushed the party even further left  empowered by groups including Justice Democrats Rather than fight that new energy  some 2020 hopefuls have decided to court it  Richard McDaniel  who helped engineer the surprise victory for Senator Doug Jones of Alabama in 2017  joined Ms  Warren s campaign as field director  Rebecca Pearcey  formerly of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee  an organization that works to elect Democrats to state legislatures  was a surprise choice as Ms  Warren s national political director In terms of racial diversity  Ms  Harris has led the way  with 12 senior staff members who are women of color  out of 17 total  That includes Julie Chavez Rodriguez  the activist granddaughter of the labor leader Cesar Chavez  Ms  Rodriguez was instrumental in helping Ms  Harris secure the endorsement of Dolores Huerta  the California labor leader who  along with Mr  Chavez  founded the United Farm Workers Another member of Ms  Harris s team is Laphonza Butler  the former president of the Service Employees International Union in California  She said activists were more likely to see electoral politics as valuable in this era because of the moral urgency that Mr  Trump s administration has instilled among liberals  We re asking ourselves these really existential questions about what are we going to be as a nation   said Ms  Butler  who is a senior adviser to Ms  Harris   And I had to choose how to best continue the work that I ve been doing as an advocate for workers and a voice for workers   and working for Senator Harris is a continuation of that  Mr  McDaniel  Ms  Warren s field director  said the shift had been building since President Barack Obama ushered in an era of internet driven  grass roots organizing  The rule book went out the door with President Obama  kind of  how you engage communities   Mr  McDaniel said   It s old school tactics  but you need to have a new mind frame of thinking  ImageJulián Castro  a former cabinet secretary  plans to diverge from the traditional early primary state road map in favor of a tour of all 50 states CreditEtienne Laurent EPA  via ShutterstockBut some in the party have warned that the embracing of activists could be more about optics than an actual shift in political power and that the bulk of decision making will still reside with the political strategy firms that have long been influential in electoral politics  Ms  Harris s campaign  for example  has deep ties to big political names such as the longtime California consultant Averell Smith  the Democratic strategist also known as Ace who helped her orchestrate several campaigns in advance of her presidential run  The proof will be in the pudding   said Jess Morales Rocketto  the political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and a former staff member on Hillary Clinton s 2016 campaign   Like who s getting to decide the budgets  who s getting to decide where the candidate goes  who s getting to decide the targeting  Is that the people of color that they hired  Ms  Morales Rocketto urged the campaigns to see employees from non Washington backgrounds as more than just an attempt to  check boxes   She said one current presidential campaign had explicitly told her recently that it was calling her because it needed a  senior Latina with movement credibility   It would be a damn shame if all they did was catch up to the optics   she added Heather McGhee  the former president of the progressive advocacy group Demos has not signed onto a 2020 campaign but said she had been contacted personally by Ms  Harris and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey   though she remains a close ally of Ms  Warren s  Her counsel was particularly valued after Demos s political arm published a much lauded 2018 paper on how candidates should fuse analysis of race and class  a key focus of the progressive message  To see the soul of the new Democratic Party  you can look to the candidate s advisers and ask whether they came from activism or professional consultant class   Ms  McGhee said One new idea was on display when Ms  Harris held a recent campaign rally in Nevada  During the event  aides passed out headsets to Spanish speaking residents so that the candidate s words

The Trump administration may not be the most unimpeachable source when it comes to human rights  but the head of the State Department s bureau for human rights  Michael Kozak  was dead on when he said China s mass incarceration of Muslim minorities was  just remarkably awful  Mr  Kozak made the comments on Wednesday as the State Department presented its annual report on human rights around the world  an event at which his boss  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  declared that China was  in a league of its own when it comes to human rights violations  That s a tough call in today s world  But China s brutal campaign to strip Uighur and other Turkic minorities in the Xinjiang region of their culture  religion and identity through a network of secretive re education camps must rank among the more outrageous continuing violations in the world  What makes it all the more galling is the Beijing government s feigned umbrage whenever the camps are mentioned  and its absurd efforts to depict them as China s contribution to the war on terrorism After initially denying the existence of the camps  China in October began a campaign to portray them as  campuses    vocational training centers  and  boarding schools  intended to bring Uighurs into the modern era China has made direct news reporting from Xinjiang all but impossible  giving access only to carefully monitored official tours  On one  Reuters reported that camp inmates praised their new life and sang  in English   If you re happy and you know it  clap your hands  Reports from survivors  Uighur dissidents  the Uighur diaspora  satellite imagery and other sources depict something far more akin to the gulag than a happy boarding school  with at least 120 000 and possibly more than a million Uighurs  out of a population of more than 10 million Muslims in Xinjiang  forced to undergo Cultural Revolution style coercion to adopt state sanctioned norms of political thought and behavior Writing in The Times  Mustafa Akyol  a senior fellow on Islam at the Cato Institute  described camps at which  people are forced to listen to ideological lectures  sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write  self criticism  essays   He said survivors told of sleep deprivation  solitary confinement  beatings and torture Conquered and incorporated into China in the 18th century  Xinjiang has long been a thorn in China s side  The Chinese government attributes scores of violent events  including bombings and assassinations  to Uighur separatists  Violent riots in July 2009 in Urumqi  the Xinjiang capital  escalated into attacks on Han Chinese people and a vicious crackdown and several death sentences But trying to extinguish national identity through what amounts to mass brainwashing is an atrocity that smacks of some of the worst experiments of our time   including China s own Cultural Revolution   with some thoroughly modern twists  A key part of China s campaign to control the Uighurs has been collecting DNA from members of the minority under the guise of a free health check Sadly  Muslim nations have been reticent about supporting the Uighurs  possibly because of the economic clout China wields among them and the solidarity some of these states have with an anti Western authoritarian regime  In February  Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was quoted on Chinese television after a meeting with President Xi Jinping as saying   China has the right to carry out antiterrorism and de extremization work for its national security   That should not dissuade other governments and organizations from continuing to focus attention on the camps  as the State Department has  A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress  the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act  would require the State Department and intelligence agencies to report on what the Chinese government is doing in Xinjiang  The bill should be promptly passed  The United States should also support the request of 15 Western ambassadors to Beijing   America s was not one of them   to meet with the Communist Party secretary in Xinjiang What is happening in Xinjiang must not be ignored RelatedOpinion   Mustafa AkyolChina s Gulag for Muslims Jan  2  2019State Dept  Accuses China of Rights Abuses Not Seen  Since the 1930s March 13  2019Opinion   The Editorial BoardWill Trump Speak Up Against China s Oppression Nov  30  2018The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram 
A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked a Kentucky law that prohibits abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected  which typically happens around six weeks into pregnancy  before many women know they are pregnant The measure  which was signed into law on Friday by the state s Republican governor  Matt Bevin  and was set to take effect immediately  was poised to become one of the strictest anti abortion laws in the country But late on Friday  the judge  David J  Hale of the Western District of Kentucky  ruled the law was potentially unconstitutional  He halted enforcement for at least 14 days to  prevent irreparable harm  until he could hold a hearing The ruling came amid a yearslong effort to curb abortions in Kentucky  which has one remaining abortion clinic  Several other states are considering similar measures  known as heartbeat bills  as states move to restrict   or shore up access to   abortion in anticipation of a more conservative Supreme Court possibly ruling on the issue The Kentucky law was one of two measures seeking to restrict abortion that were passed by the state s Republican controlled legislature this week but are now being contested  The other  a bill that prohibits abortion if a woman wants to end her pregnancy because of the diagnosis of a disability in the fetus  among other reasons  is awaiting approval from the governor The American Civil Liberties Union challenged both measures in a lawsuit filed this week on behalf of EMW Women s Surgical Center  the state s only licensed abortion clinic  We think this is a very straightforward legal issue   Brigitte Amiri  deputy director of the A C L U  s Reproductive Freedom Project  said on Saturday   States can t ban abortion  It has been well settled over 40 years ago in Roe v  Wade  The judge on Friday did not address the second bill and Ms  Amiri said the group planned to ask the judge for a ruling on it after it was signed into law Steve Pitt  general counsel to the governor  said on Saturday that ruling was not unexpected  given the minimal amount of briefing that has occurred   This case or others like it from other states will result in major changes in abortions in the U S  in the near future   he said   The A C L U   Planned Parenthood and others favoring unlimited abortions know this and are in a panic  The governor has made anti abortion legislation a priority of his administration and has welcomed the chance to fight for protections in court In a video message on Friday  he chided his  good friends at the A C L U   for challenging the second bill  which would ban abortions based on a fetus s disability  sex or race  before it had been signed into law and suggested they needed a civics refresher from  Schoolhouse Rock   on how legislation works  They frankly don t care whether they are following the law or not   said Mr  Bevin  who has expressed support for the bill   They simply want to push their ideology  The landscape of the Supreme Court changed last year after Justice Brett M  Kavanaugh  seen as a reliable conservative  replaced the court s longtime swing vote  Justice Anthony M  Kennedy  who retired  The change added urgency to the question of whether Roe v  Wade  the landmark 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide  would survive the Trump administration But legal experts have suggested that any developments  at least in the near term  will most likely come at the state level  with states succeeding in smaller cases that limit   but not eliminate   the right to an abortion  Other states  including Iowa and North Dakota  have passed similarly prohibitive fetal heartbeat measures only to have them swiftly voided by the courts as unconstitutional Supreme Court decisions have given women a right to abortion until a fetus is viable outside the womb  usually around 24 weeks into pregnancy Ms  Amiri said the fetal heartbeat bill would effectively eliminate abortion in Kentucky  About 90 percent of abortions in the state are performed after six weeks  according to the lawsuit  The law would make an exception for procedures that were necessary to prevent death or serious risk to the woman She said Judge Hale s ruling came as a  tremendous relief   The clinic sees patients today  and before we got the ruling yesterday  they were in the process of canceling appointments   Ms  Amiri said on Saturday   It means they will be able to provide care today and that is incredibly important to every person who comes to the clinic  
GENEVA   As China prepared to defend its record before the United Nations Human Rights Council  the United States on Wednesday led Western governments  academic experts and human rights supporters in challenging Beijing over its mass detention of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang China s oppression of religious and ethnic minorities is well known   What s new is the breadth of the repression and how the Chinese government is using breakthroughs in technology to increase its effectiveness   Kelley Currie  a senior United States diplomat  told a meeting on the sidelines of the council in Geneva The United States would consider targeted measures against Xinjiang officials to promote accountability for violations there  said Ms  Currie  who serves with the State Department s Office of Global Criminal Justice  She urged China to reverse its policies and allow access to the region by United Nations experts The United States withdrew from the human rights council last year  accusing it of having an anti Israeli bias and serving as a platform for some of the world s worst rights abusers  but it has since pulled back from complete disengagement American diplomats returned to the council months later to criticize China s human rights record  The United States called Wednesday s meeting an effort to draw global attention to China s extreme measures in detaining upward of a million people in re education and detention centers and to build momentum for action by countries that are members of the Human Rights Council The meeting also highlighted an escalating effort by China to counter international criticism  China is scheduled to appear at the council on Thursday for the last round of a formal review of its human rights performance Leading up to that appearance  China played host to diplomats from several largely sympathetic countries posted to their diplomatic missions in Geneva   including Pakistan  Russia  Belarus  Cuba and Venezuela  It led guided tours of Xinjiang and showed off what it called vocational training centers China s mission to the United Nations in Geneva organized four meetings and a photo exhibition to reinforce that narrative  Diplomats and human rights activists reported that it also lobbied hard to dissuade other countries from attending the United States event on Wednesday  warning it would view participation as a hostile act That pushback  along with qualms about aligning too closely with the Trump administration appears to have kept some countries from supporting the event  But Britain  Germany  the Netherlands and Canada agreed to sponsor the meeting  drawing diplomats from a dozen countries and a large crowd of rights activists Adrian Zenz  a German lecturer and an expert on Xinjiang  told the gathering that China s re education and detention centers have expanded rapidly in the past two years and may hold as many as 1 5 million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities  He called China s tactics  nothing less than a systematic campaign of cultural genocide  Omir Bekali  a 43 year old Kazakh Uyghur  said that Xinjiang police arrested and tortured him for days in 2017  after which he was held at a camp for six months  in a small room with 40 people There  Mr  Bekali said  the detainees had to sing songs about President Xi Jinping  praise the country s Communist Party and eat pork   We had no right to talk   he told those who attended the meeting A diplomat who carried a placard that identified him as representing China called Mr  Bekali s account  a complete lie   These centers are nothing else than normal boarding schools  he said That narrative  supported by China s political and economic muscle  has silenced many countries  especially those that are predominantly Muslim  human rights groups say In an earlier council session reviewing China s human rights record  Turkey was the only Muslim country that criticized China s treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslims Still  human rights groups saw Wednesday s meeting as a chance to build momentum for a stronger response by Human Rights Council members later this year Beijing s strong defense of its measures in Xinjiang  Mr  Zenz said   tells me that the re education campaign  there  is part of a more strategic effort that we may see expand beyond Xinjiang and possibly beyond China  
We ve ended the live portion of our coverage  Read our latest coverage   The views of pilots and instructors on the potential risks of trainees spending more time learning automated systems than manual control    A visual explanation of why investigators fear two Boeing 737 Max aircraft may have crashed for similar reasons    The United States decision to ground Boeing s 737 Max aircraft on Wednesday  Passengers in the United States were bracing for delays on Thursday  a day after President Trump announced the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the wake of a deadly crash in Ethiopia  but experts said the three American carriers that operate the planes would replace the jets with other aircraft   The so called black boxes  voice and flight data recorders  recovered from the wreckage of Flight 302 were sent to France for analysis on Thursday  Ethiopian Airlines said  Satellite data has revealed similarities between Sunday s crash and the October crash of a plane flown by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air  but the recorders contain more detailed information about the Ethiopian flight s final moments   New disclosures point to what appears to have been a struggle by pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 to control their new Max 8 aircraft minutes after takeoff From 8 600 Flights to Zero  Grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8China was the first major country to ground the jets  The U S  was last Will your flight be delayed  Maybe  Also  check your seat assignment Delays are inevitable  and some customers will be inconvenienced  as airlines reshuffle their plans in the wake of a presidential order grounding about 70 Boeing Max aircraft across the United States The planes operated by Southwest  American and United airlines carry about 300 000 passengers per week  said Scott Mayerowitz  the executive editorial director of The Points Guy  a travel website  Airlines could cancel some of those flights and rebook passengers on similar trips  or briefly delay routine maintenance on some of the few planes they have in standby  he said The airlines may reassign planes originally designated for different routes  For example  an airline could cancel one of its frequent Chicago to New York flights  which typically are not sold out  rebook those passengers and reassign a plane That could result in delays and cancellations not just on routes that fly 737 Max jets  but those that use different planes that have been redirected to routes formerly flown by a Max jet No matter the fix  the swap could mean a different seating arrangement  Mr  Mayerowitz said passengers planning to fly in the next few weeks should check their airline s website to make sure their seat assignments have not changed after switching aircraft  Passengers who were booked in an aisle seat or extra leg room might now find themselves in the back of a jet  stuck in a middle seat   he said Why Investigators Fear the Two Boeing 737s Crashed for Similar ReasonsThe planes flew in similar erratic patterns  suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights  Black boxes  head to France for analysisEthiopia sent the  black boxes  recovered from the wreckage of Flight 302 to Paris on Thursday  Ethiopian Airlines said on Twitter  as investigators hope to conduct a more detailed analysis of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders The boxes  which can withstand temperatures of 2 012 degrees Fahrenheit  collect critical information about a flight  Microphones in the cockpit record the pilots  voices and other telling sounds Information gleaned from the data recorder can reveal nuances about a flight s altitude  instrument readings and power settings  which help create detailed models of the crash The analysis of the boxes is expected to take months  but the American authorities decided on Wednesday to ground all Boeing 737 Max jets after studying satellite data that suggested similarities between the Ethiopian crash and the October Lion Air crash of a Max 8 in which all 189 people on board were killed The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement on Wednesday that the decision to temporarily ground the planes was based on  new evidence collected at the site and analyzed today   but did not go into detail  This evidence   it said   together with newly refined satellite data available to F A A  this morning  led to this decision  ImageEthiopian relatives of Flight 302 victims mourned at the crash site on Thursday CreditMulugeta Ayene Associated PressPilots struggled to control the plane within minutesShortly after takeoff from Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa  the captain of the Ethiopian Airlines jetliner reported  flight control problems  to air traffic control  That suggests that the cockpit crew was having trouble with the mechanical instruments used to handle the aircraft  the computerized systems that fly it  or both The pilot s alert was reported Wednesday by a spokesman for the airline  Asrat Begashaw  the airline s chief executive  Tewolde GebreMariam  had made similar remarks to CNN the day before Mr  Begashaw said the control tower had granted the crew s request to return to the airport  but the plane crashed three minutes later  killing all aboard The disclosure added to suggestions that the plane had not responded to intended actions by the pilots  There has been no suggestion so far of terrorism or other outside interference in the functioning of the aircraft  which was only a few months old In earlier evidence pointing to the possibility of an intrinsic problem with the Max 8 model  control issues were reported by the crew of the Lion Air Max 8 that crashed minutes after takeoff in Indonesia last October Mr  Begashaw declined to specify what control problems might have led to the crash on Sunday  which killed all 157 people aboard 
Dr  Scott Gottlieb became commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 with an ambitious plan to reduce cigarette smoking  a habit that kills nearly half a million Americans each year  by shifting smokers to less harmful alternatives like e cigarettes But he was quickly embroiled in an unexpected crisis  the explosion of vaping among millions of middle and high school students  many of whom were getting addicted to nicotine Dr  Gottlieb will depart at the end of this month  following his sudden announcement last week that he would resign  with his plans to toughen regulation of both vaping and smoking unfinished and powerful lobbying forces quietly celebrating the exit of a politically canny administrator who aggressively wielded his regulatory powers Opponents are already swooping in  making their case to Congress and reaching out to the White House  A coalition of conservative organizations that oppose government intervention in the marketplace has harshly criticized Dr  Gottlieb s crackdown on e cigarettes  Retailers  including convenience store and gas station owners  are on Capitol Hill lobbying against guidelines Dr  Gottlieb proposed on Wednesday to restrict sales of most flavored e cigarettes to separate adult only areas and to require age verification of customers And major tobacco companies are likely to seize on his departure to try to scuttle his long term plans to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels and to ban menthol cigarettes  which make up more than a third of the cigarette market and dominate sales to African Americans  Some longtime officials inside the F D A  said privately that they fear these ideas could be delayed indefinitely  There have been well intentioned commissioners before Gottlieb   said Jonathan Havens  a former F D A  tobacco lawyer now in private practice   But they were not as good at capturing the attention of the nation  of the stakeholders  I think that momentum could very well stall on some of these products  or be lost completely  This pivotal moment in regulation of smoking and vaping comes just months after Altria  maker of Marlboro cigarettes and the nation s largest tobacco company  with a market value of  100 billion  bought a 35 percent stake in Juul  the nation s dominant vaping company whose valuation soared on the investment to  38 billion Juul s alliance with Altria has given it access to a far more muscular  experienced political player  Altria gave  500 000 to Mr  Trump s inaugural committee  and spent more than  10 million on lobbying last year  according to the Center for Responsive Politics Dr  Gottlieb has expressed anger that Juul and Altria were negotiating their financial deal in secret  while each was making promises to the F D A  that he believes the deal broke  The investment in Juul means that Altria  with net sales of cigarettes and other products last year amounting to  25 4 billion  is now selling flavored e cigarettes  which it had told the F D A  it would stop doing  he said  Proponents of vaping  who support these companies   he said in an interview   ought to realize just how much these companies are putting their short term business objectives ahead of any long term goals for these technologies to be effective tools for adult smokers  The question is whether Dr  Gottlieb s successor will continue his policies and enforce them  On Tuesday  Dr  Norman E   Ned  Sharpless  director of the National Cancer Institute  was named to replace him in an acting capacity and is in the running to succeed him permanently Dr  Gottlieb supports Dr  Sharpless  who said he would continue his predecessor s policies  Alex M  Azar II  secretary of health and human services  said in a statement Wednesday that the administration backs closing off children s access to e cigarettes  while making them available to adult smokers trying to quit ImageCreditScott McIntyre for The New York Times I m hearing from people who are gleeful that he s gone   Liz Mair  a Republican political consultant who founded Vapers United  a group that supports vaping as a tool to stop smoking  said of Dr  Gottlieb   I think people who are doing a victory lap right now better watch and see what direction things are moving in  It s not   Oh  the vaper wars have been won   I wouldn t bank on that  Dr  Gottlieb s decision to leave just as his regulatory efforts on e cigarettes were coming to fruition has set off speculation that he had lost favor within the administration  Dr  Gottlieb denied that  noting that the administration s budget includes his request for the e cigarette industry to pay fees  estimated at  100 million  that would primarily go toward enforcing limits on flavored e cigarettes to protect teenagers   What that tells you is I got broad buy in into that   he said in an interview When he became commissioner in May 2017  his goal was to move smokers to less harmful alternatives  such as e cigarettes  That July  he allowed e cigarette companies to keep their vaping devices and nicotine pods on the market for an extra four years before they would have to prove their products would benefit public health During that time  the F D A  also sought to limit nicotine in cigarettes to encourage smokers to switch to vaping  But his original plan grew untenable as evidence of Juul s popularity with teenagers mounted In an interview  he recalled the morning in August 2018 when Mitch Zeller  the director of the agency s tobacco control unit  brought him the bad news  Vaping was up 78 percent among high school students and 48 percent among middle school students  with 3 6 million youths reporting they had used e cigarettes  according to the 2018 National Tobacco Youth Survey A few weeks later  Dr  Gottlieb called youth vaping an epidemic  and gave e cigarette makers 60 days to show how they would curb youth vaping  or risk having their products pulled from the shelves  Juul pulled mango  crème and other flavors off the shelves but continued to sell them on line The conservative leaders now fighting restrictions on flavored e cigarettes include Grover Norquist s anti tax group  Americans for Tax Reform  the R Street Institute and the American Legislative Exchange Council Action  a nonprofit  In a letter dated Feb  4  a coalition of these and 13 other groups urged President Trump to  halt the Food and Drug Administration s aggressive regulatory assault on businesses who sell and consumers who rely on less harmful alternatives to cigarettes in the United States  Both Juul and Altria say they had nothing to do with this message to the president  But in recent years  both companies have donated to Mr  Norquist s group and to some of the other groups that signed the letter In 2017  Altria made contributions to the Goldwater Institute  the Rio Grande Foundation  the R Street Institute  and the Independent Women s Forum  as well as Mr  Norquist s group  according to an Altria annual philanthropy report that did not specify the amounts And Juul confirmed its contributions to Mr  Norquist s group  the R Street Institute  where Tevi Troy  Juul s vice president of public policy  and a friend of Dr  Gottlieb s  was once a board member  and to ALEC Action  Juul declined to disclose the size of its donations Joshua Raffel  a spokesman for Juul  said the company had not asked the conservative coalition to write to the White House  but he acknowledged that one of the company s lobbyists or consultants might have discussed it with the organizations involved  Juul spokesman  Matt David  said the company backs the restrictions on sales in convenience stores  We need category wide action to further combat youth usage of all e vapor products   he said  That includes  Juul said  requiring the age restriction for tobacco and e cigarette sales to be raised nationwide to 21  a legislative proposal that Dr  Gottlieb has supported Public heath advocates remain dubious about Juul s commitment to curbing teenage use  with some saying the company wants to have it both ways  supporting groups that oppose restrictions on teenage access  while waging a public relations campaign that it never intended youths to use its product Juul has also been ramping up its lobbying operation and political contributions  In 2018  it reported donations to the Democratic and Republican attorneys general associations  the Democratic and Republican governors associations  and other federal and state political committees  Juul s political action committee and affiliated individuals also gave a total of  215 000 to federal candidates and their committees  according to the Center for Responsive Politics  Juul spent more than  1 6 million on lobbying last year  the center noted ImageAltria s Center for Research and Technology in Richmond  Va  Altria bought a 35 percent stake in Juul last year CreditKhue Bui for The New York TimesFor years  the tobacco industry has come under fire for marketing cigarettes  especially menthol cigarettes  to African American communities  Juul appears to be trying to court various groups   perhaps to promote its menthol flavored e cigarettes   with various donations  The San Francisco based company has contributed to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation  and the National Newspaper Publishers Association  a trade group for African American owned community newspapers The company has also retained lobbyist Chaka Burgess  co managing partner of the Empire Consulting Group who serves on the governing boards of the black caucus  foundation and the caucus  political action committee  and on that of the NAACP Foundation Juul has also announced a partnership with the Black Mental Health Alliance  although it declined to give details  as did the alliance  The vaping company said its  35 000 donation to the black caucus  foundation involved buying a table at an event Taking another page from the Big Tobacco playbook  Juul also started JLI Science  a website showcasing Juul funded research on electronic nicotine delivery system products  The Centre for Substance Use Research  based in Glasgow  Scotland  conducted several studies now listed on the site  including one that says adolescents who had never used an e cigarette had very low interest in using one in any of Juul s eight flavors  and another that concluded most adolescents had never heard of Juul Representative Diana DeGette  a Democrat from Colorado who now heads a House subcommittee that oversees the F D A   said she favors banning the sale of all flavored e cigarettes  She also said in an interview that she plans to demand marketing documents that Juul submitted to the F D A   which has been investigating whether the company deliberately targeted youths Senator Charles Schumer  Democrat of New York  said on Sunday in an interview that he would press Dr  Gottlieb s replacement to follow through on restricting sales of flavored e cigarettes Dr  Gottlieb had planned to ultimately force tobacco companies to cut nicotine to nonaddictive levels  and said in interviews that he believed he had the authority as F D A  commissioner to issue such a policy  despite profound cigarette industry opposition to cutting the ingredient that makes smokers crave their next smoke Altria last year told the F D A  that it would oppose any effort to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes  and disputed the agency s authority to do so  And it maintains two websites that cranked out thousands of virtually identical letters to the F D A  against nicotine reduction  signed by smokers Dr  Gottlieb had also suggested pursuing a ban on menthol cigarettes  and said that the F D A  is now developing that rule  which would need to win White House approval In comments on its website  Altria contends that a ban on menthol would damage public tax revenues generated by cigarette sales and lead to illegal black markets The American Lung Association often cites a study indicating that more than three quarters of African American cigarette smokers said they prefer menthol cigarettes  compared to less than a quarter of white smokers  Menthol cigarettes make up 35 to 40 percent of the market in the United States  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Asked if this effort would continue without Dr  Gottlieb s leadership  a spokeswoman for H H S  declined to comment  but sent links to previous statements in support of the F D A  s tobacco plans  Dr  Gottlieb has acknowledged it would take years to move a proposed menthol ban forward  Big tobacco companies will want to educate whoever takes that position   said Marc Scheineson  a lawyer who works with smaller tobacco companies  He said that these groups would inevitably try to reverse any move toward a menthol ban  which he called  a Scott Gottlieb priority   He was definitely running this train   Mr  Scheineson said 
Periods of major political transformation have never been particularly easy for Jews  and the current moment is no exception  Anti Semitism is ascendant in Europe and many fear that the resurgence of nationalism will exacerbate it But there is a twist  Anti Semitism s rise in Europe is being accompanied by a growing fascination among Europe s hard right with Israel and  in particular  its prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  This captivation is particularly acute among the governing national populist parties in Central Europe  a region where anti Semitism has historically found fertile ground Central European leaders view Mr  Netanyahu as a close ally  Last year  the Visegrad Group  an organization for cooperation between Central European countries  announced plans to hold a meeting in Israel   its first outside of Europe  That plan was ultimately foiled by a spat between Poland and Israel over the Holocaust  but the symbolism was nonetheless significant and leaders from the three remaining Visegrad Group countries   Hungary  the Czech Republic and Slovakia   went to Israel  For his part  Mr  Netanyahu has cultivated relationships with Central European populist leaders  He called Viktor Orban a  true friend of Israel  at the same time that prominent members of the Jewish community in Budapest were criticizing the Hungarian leader for the anti Semitic tones of his campaign against George Soros Why are Central European populists attracted to Mr  Netanyahu s Israel in the way that Western European leftists of the 1960s and  70s were once mesmerized by Fidel Castro s Cuba Undeniably  there is realpolitik here  Israel is a rational actor and like any rational actor  it wants allies  Mr  Netanyahu sees in the governments of Central Europe potential defenders within the European Union who could help dampen pressure from Brussels over Israel s checkered human rights record  To that end  he has frequently visited the region  His efforts have been repaid  The Czech Republic  Hungary and Romania recently blocked a European Union statement criticizing the United States over its plan to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem RelatedOpinion

Became the EnemyApril 6  2018For Central European governments  a special relationship with Israel is a way to benefit from Israel s dynamic economy and cozy up to President Trump and his pro Israel administration  It is widely believed in the region that in order for a leader of a small Central European country to get an invitation to visit the White House  he should either buy a lot of American military equipment or Mr  Netanyahu should lobby for the visit But the populist alliance with Israel is more than a marriage of convenience and strategic calculation Shlomo Avineri  the great liberal Israeli scholar  once argued that while Israel is in the Middle East  its politics are often East European  It s not just that the former Soviet Union is the No  1 source of emigration to Israel these days  though that  too  seems to be affecting the country s politics  Many of the founders of the Jewish state were from Central and Eastern Europe and their political imagination was shaped by the politics of the newly independent states that emerged in the region after World War I Zionism in many respects was the mirror image of the nationalistic   and often anti Semitic   politics that dominated Central and Eastern Europe between the two world wars  What attracts Eastern European populists to Israel today is their old dream realized  Israel is a democracy  but an ethnic democracy  it defines itself as the state for Jews in the same way East Europeans imagine their countries as a state for Poles  Hungarians or Slovaks  It has preserved the heroic ethos of sacrifice in the name of the nation that nationalist politicians covet for their own societies Then there s demographics  Central and Eastern Europeans see Israel as the only Western society that is winning the population war by reversing the trend of demographic decline  At the moment when Eastern Europe is the fastest shrinking region in the world  Israel s success in persuading diasporic Jews to return  and its efficacy in convincing Israelis to have more children  looks like a miracle East European populists also share Mr  Netanyahu s mistrust in anything that appears post national or hints of cosmopolitanism  They agree with Yoram Hazony  a conservative Israeli political philosopher and Netanyahu supporter who is the author of the influential  The Virtue of Nationalism   who says that the major political clash in world history is neither between classes nor nations  but between nationalists who believe that the nation state is the best form of political organization and imperialists who advocate for universal empire  For Mr  Hazony and for his followers  the Roman Empire  the Hapsburg Empire  the Soviet Union  the European Union  and even the post Cold War United States are just different embodiments of the idea of universal empire  And the responsibility of genuine nationalists is to fight for their destruction ImageDespite the Hungarian leader s anti semitic rhetoric  Benjamin Netanyahu warmly greeted Prime Minister Viktor Orban on his arrival at his office in Jerusalem last year CreditDebbie Hill Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Netanyahu provides an attractive model of politics in other ways  too  He fights elections like they are take no prisoner wars and his voters are willing to forgive accusations of corruption against him  Mr  Orban sees much to admire there  Meanwhile  he is willing to weather criticism from the rest of the world  while simultaneously retaining the right to feel like a victim   a strategy the Law and Justice party in Poland is emulating  Israel is a small country  but thanks to its economic and military power it plays in the league of the great powers  and demonstrates a capacity to defy even the United States Understanding Central European nationalists  fascination with Israel helps us grasp their political dreams  but it also reveals their limits  A key to Israel s nationalist politics and its resistance to international pressure is the Israeli argument that the country faces existential threats  Yes  sometimes Israeli politicians cynically exploit those threats  but still the threats are real  The same cannot be said of Central Europe  which now as part of the European Union enjoys the most peaceful period in the region s history Populist leaders in Central Europe view Israel as the model of how a small state could be sovereign and heroic  But it is the dream of a normal life rather than a fantasy of heroic sacrifice that ultimately motivates most East Europeans In other words  it is easier to admire Israel than to persuade their societies to emulate it The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of

BEIJING   China s premier delivered on Friday the clearest acknowledgment yet from a top Chinese official that the country s economy is slowing and faces a series of difficulties Li Keqiang  who as premier is China s second highest official after President Xi Jinping  said at his annual news conference that the answer lay in cutting corporate taxes and deregulation  and not a return to the strategy during previous downturns of printing money and ramping up government spending  However  recently released economic data has suggested that the government is indeed turning to monetary expansion and heavy infrastructure investments in an effort to stabilize growth Mr  Li also became on Friday the most senior Chinese official to try to allay foreign worries that Chinese technology companies spy on other countries at Beijing s request  saying that this has not happened and will not  He appeared to be addressing concerns that the United States and some of its allies have been raising about Huawei  the Chinese technology giant Mr  Li delivered his acknowledgment of the slowdown at an annual meeting with foreign and domestic reporters that the Chinese leadership often uses to outline its priorities to its people and the world  Mr  Li and past premiers have sometimes used the event to offer reassurances that Beijing is tackling problems in an orderly way The leadership screens questions beforehand  however  to ensure that embarrassing or sensitive topics don t come up  For example  there were no questions this year about the government s roundup of as many as one million Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities in internment camps in western China Speaking in one of the cavernous chambers of the Great Hall of the People next to Tiananmen Square  Mr  Li from the start answered questions about the economic slowdown  which has been a major preoccupation for many Chinese people since the summer  It is true that China s economy has encountered new downward pressure   he said in response to the first question asked   We must take strong measures to cope with the current downward pressure  He cited  as one example  the government s sharp cuts in corporate taxes  particularly for manufacturers  which were unveiled on March 5  But he also tried to ease concerns that have spread since then about whether the tax cuts would lead to much wider government deficits  Mr  Li said that the government would demand that the state owned banking sector and the country s many state owned enterprises turn over a greater share of their profits to Beijing  Our determination is to dig into existing interests  and this will be like turning a knife into the government itself   he said Accomplishing that could be politically difficult  however  The Communist Party relies heavily on state owned and state controlled banks and companies to help it maintain tight political control  to provide jobs for millions of party members and to cushion the effects of the economic slowdown on struggling regions  like northeastern China China tries to keep its official budget deficit below 3 percent of the country s economic output  a goal it has openly copied from the European Union s rules for its member nations  But local governments have long borrowed money using shadowy financial vehicles and other ways to keep the loans off official books Mr  Li also tried on Friday to address concerns raised by the United States and some of its allies about whether Chinese tech companies like Huawei might use the equipment that they install overseas to gather intelligence for the Chinese government China s national intelligence law  adopted in 2017  says   All organizations and citizens shall support  assist and cooperate with national intelligence efforts according to the law   But Mr  Li strongly denied that the Chinese government asked Chinese companies to engage in spying  This is not consistent with Chinese law  This is not how China behaves   Mr  Li said   We did not do that  and we will not do that in the future  An hour before the news conference  the National People s Congress approved a new foreign investment law  the main legislation before it this year  The Trump administration has pressed China for the past year to put foreign businesses on a more equal legal footing with their Chinese competitors China s legislature made some tweaks to the law before passing it  notably to exhort Chinese government agencies to do a better job of protecting corporate trade secrets  But foreign business groups   which have long complained that Chinese officials and companies force them to give up their trade secrets in order to do business in China   say the new law still does not go far enough The law s provisions  are still quite general and do not address a number of the persistent concerns of foreign companies or foreign invested enterprises in China   said Timothy P  Stratford  chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China and the managing partner of the Beijing office of the Covington and Burling law firm The law may still leave foreign businesses at a legal disadvantage  especially with respect to state owned enterprises and other Chinese businesses with strong state connections  he said  The law provides broad scope for national security reviews  he said  And the law has cursorily written provisions   many are just a single sentence   while giving broad latitude to Chinese regulators Mr  Li dismissed concerns about how China would carry out the law   If we make a promise on opening up  we will certainly deliver   he said during his annual news conference  later adding   We will treat both domestic and foreign invested enterprises as equals  The Communist Party orchestrates the National People s Congress as an effusive show of political unity  Few delegates dare make even mild criticisms of major government policies  and the decisions and resolutions on the final day always win approval from the overwhelming majority of the nearly 3 000 delegates This year was no different  Only eight delegates voted against the new foreign investment law  and another eight abstained  while 2 929 voted to approve it  But there was a louder note of dissent over the annual report from China s supreme court  156 delegates voted against it  and 67 abstained The annual supreme court report often draws a relatively high number of  no  votes  as some delegates use the opportunity to vent against judicial corruption and inequity  But this year s  no  vote was higher than last year s  perhaps reflecting dismay over a scandal that stirred up allegations   dismissed by the government   that supreme court judges had meddled in a controversial property dispute and spirited away important files from the case 
When Don Cue developed a bladder infection last fall  he called his longtime urologist s office for a urine culture and antibiotics  It was a familiar routine for the two time prostate cancer survivor  infections were not uncommon since he began using a catheter that connects to his bladder through an incision in his abdomen When Mr  Cue called this time  a receptionist told him that his physician  Dr  Mark Kellerman  no longer worked at the Iowa Clinic in Des Moines  a large multi specialty group  She refused to divulge where he had gone  As a patient   scared  is too strong a word  but my feeling is   What do I do now    said Mr  Cue  58 Flummoxed  he solved his immediate problem by taking leftover antibiotics he had in his medicine cabinet It was only later that he learned his doctor had been fired by the Iowa Clinic and planned to start a urology practice with clinic colleagues  And  under the terms of their contract with their former employer  the doctors were banned for a year from practicing within 35 miles of the clinic  and from recruiting former patients to follow them Contracts with so called restrictive covenants are now common in medicine  although some states limit their use  Noncompete clauses   common in many commercial sectors   aim to stop physicians and other health care professionals from taking patients with them if they move to a competing practice nearby or start their own  But what may be good for business can be bad for patient care   and certainly disquieting for those whose doctors seem to simply disappear One survey of nearly 2 000 primary care physicians in five states found that roughly 45 percent were bound by such clauses Continuity of care is important  doctors say  especially for patients with ongoing medical issues  Cutting off access to a doctor is different from disrupting someone s relationship with a favorite hairstylist or money manager  they say  When doctors want to move from one practice to another  if they ve got good therapeutic relationships with their patients  you d think that public policy would want them to continue to treat these patients that trust them   said Judy Conti  government affairs director at the National Employment Law Project Charlie Wittmack  a lawyer at Hartung Schroeder in Des Moines  is representing Dr  Kellerman and two other urologists who were also fired in a lawsuit against the Iowa Clinic  The wrongful termination suit asks the court to declare the physicians  restrictive covenant provisions unenforceable  Mr  Wittmack said the controversy there was  tragic  for patients   These are people who have prostate cancer or are in extreme pain because of kidney stones or have blood in their urine  Ed Brown  the clinic s chief executive  said the noncompete agreements were not just about business but to help ensure that the practice can provide reliable services  Noncompetes are good for the patients because they help to provide stability within a practice and ensure continuity of care   Mr  Brown said recently in an email  Further  he added  noncompetes protect physicians by ensuring that other physicians in the practice are committed to it and can t abandon it without proper notice The urologists  believe they can make more money elsewhere  and they don t want to be held to any contractual responsibilities   he said Even when longtime patients go sleuthing to find their doctors  new offices  they may not be accepted into those practices  Hospitals and clinics say they have little choice but to respect the terms of business agreements that others have negotiated ImageEd Brown  chief executive of the Iowa Clinic  said noncompete agreements were not just about business   Noncompetes are good for the patients because they help to provide stability within a practice and ensure continuity of care   he said CreditKathryn Gamble for The New York TimesUW Health  the health care system for the University of Wisconsin Madison  recently hired three primary care doctors who had worked across town  said Dr  Sandra Kamnetz  vice chairwoman of clinical care for the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Wisconsin s School of Medicine and Public Health  They are taking great pains not to treat any of the new doctors  former patients because the terms of the doctors  contracts with their old employer prohibit them from doing so for two years Staff at the UW clinics ask prospective patients if they ve ever been seen by one of the doctors  They then check the patient s electronic health record to confirm there are no messages  prescription refills or other recent contact with the new UW Health doctors and that patient at the previous job  Dr  Kamnetz said  Patients get frustrated  but what they may not understand is that this is a legal thing that we have to abide by   she said Whether noncompete clauses are binding in health care   especially when patient care is disrupted   is a point legal scholars debate  In general  to be enforceable  the agreements must be reasonable and narrowly drawn so that they protect an employer s legitimate business interest but don t unduly restrict a doctor s ability to make a living Courts may weigh whether enforcing a noncompete clause would create a physician shortage in a particular region or specialty  The guiding principle is patient choice  said David J  Clark  a partner in the New York office of the law firm Epstein Becker Green who has analyzed state noncompete statutes in health care  No court is going to deny a patient who wants to go see a doctor of her choice   Mr  Clark said Most disputes are settled before they make it to court  however A recent report by the Trump administration evaluating how to promote choice and competition in health care recommended that states examine noncompete agreements for their effect on patients  access to care and the supply of providers Several states  including Massachusetts and Colorado  that allow noncompete clauses in employment contracts generally won t enforce them against doctors  according to Mr  Clark s analysis Other states  such as Texas and Tennessee  place limits on the agreements  In Texas  for example  a noncompete pact must allow doctors to have access to a list of their patients in the past year and access to their medical records  among other things  Mr  Clark found Medical board rules take it a step further   In Texas  when a physician leaves  the practice is required to cooperate with a physician who wants to put up a notice that says this is where that physician can now be contacted   said Kathy Poppitt  a partner in the health care and government and internal investigations practices at the Austin  Texas  office of King   Spalding The American Medical Association  which represents doctors  doesn t oppose restrictive covenants outright  although its policy notes they can limit patients  choices   To the extent that these agreements disrupt continuity of care and disrupt patient choice  this is of great concern to the A M A    said Dr  Patrice Harris  the organization s president elect For patients in central Iowa  the departures of longtime urologists at the Iowa Clinic is dizzying  After Dr  Kellerman and his colleagues left  five of the clinic s remaining seven urologists submitted their resignations  They are also subject to noncompete restrictions  They left the practice in mid February Mr  Brown  the clinic s chief executive  said the urology department had replaced four of the eight urologists and has nine nurse practitioners or physician assistants to treat patients  The clinic is continuing to recruit physicians and advanced practice providers like nurse practitioners Susan Murphy  72  has seen a number of doctors in the urology department there  Dr  Richard Glowacki  one of the urologists who left with Dr  Kellerman  performed surgery to remove her kidney stones over a decade ago  Another  Dr  Stephanie Pothoven  did surgery to repair her prolapsed uterus a few years ago Ms  Murphy said she got a letter from Dr  Pothoven announcing her departure  It didn t provide details about where she would be going  I ve got it etched in my brain to find out where they went   she said  She has no plans to return to the Iowa Clinic   Somehow they lost sight of patient care and were more concerned about the bottom line   she said 
In nearly 100 million flights by United States passenger airlines over the past decade  there has been a single fatality  Other than most landings and takeoffs  the planes have largely been flying themselves But the recent crashes of Boeing 737 Max 8 jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia have raised questions about the downside of all that automation Pilots now spend more time learning these automated systems than practicing hands on flying  so newer pilots are less comfortable with taking manual control when the computer steers them wrong  according to interviews with a dozen pilots and pilot instructors at major airlines and aviation universities around the world  The automation in the aircraft  whether it s a Boeing or an Airbus  has lulled us into a sense of security and safety   said Kevin Hiatt  a former Delta Air Lines pilot who later ran flight safety for JetBlue  Pilots now rely on autopilot so often   they become a systems operator rather than a stick and rudder pilot  As a result  he said   they may not exactly know or recognize quickly enough what is happening to the aircraft  and by the time they figure it out  it may be too late  In October  a Lion Air jet crashed in Indonesia  killing 189 people  Investigators now think the pilots struggled to control the Boeing aircraft after its automated systems malfunctioned  in part because they didn t fully understand how the automation worked  The authorities are investigating what caused Sunday s crash of the same model jet in Ethiopia  in which 157 people died VideoBoeing introduced the 737 Max as a reliable fuel  and cost efficient solution to air travel in the 21st century  After two fatal Max crashes  all of the Max aircraft in the world are believed to have been grounded CreditCreditChang W  Lee The New York TimesWhile automation has contributed to the airline industry s stellar safety record in recent years  it has also been a factor in many of the crashes that have still occurred around the world  A 2011 study by a federal task force found that in about 60 percent of 46 recent accidents  pilots had trouble manually flying the plane or handling the automated controls  Complicated automation systems can also confuse pilots and potentially cause them to take action they shouldn t  pilots said President Trump weighed in on Tuesday  posting on Twitter that airplanes have become too technologically complex and that he wants  great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane  Overdependence on automation has been an issue for decades  A 1997 American Airlines pilot training video warned that the problem was well known among pilots  In 2013  a federal task force concluded in a 267 page report that pilots relied too often on automation and should be required to improve their manual flying skills  That same year  investigators found that the pilots over relied on automation in the 2013 crash of an Asiana Airlines jet in San Francisco that left three dead In recent years  the Federal Aviation Administration has advised airlines to encourage pilots to fly manually when appropriate  among other policies intended to improve manual skills  A specific focus of our efforts has been ensuring that our pilots have the manual handling skills and confidence to take control of the aircraft if the automation does not perform as expected   an F A A  spokesman said in an email Yet the agency moves slowly  This week  the F A A  finally began enforcing a rule it announced about six years ago requiring pilots to practice in simulators how to handle stalls  a situation in which a plane loses lift  The rule was enacted in response to a 2009 crash In 2016  the Transportation Department s Office of Inspector General issued a report that found the F A A  had not ensured that airlines adequately trained pilots in hands on flying or on how to monitor a plane on autopilot  The report also found the agency did not track how often pilots flew manually ImageAn American Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 heading to its arrival gate at Miami International Airport this week  Two recent crashes of the jets have raised questions about the downside of all the automation on planes CreditJoe Raedle Getty ImagesA decade ago  Chesley B  Sullenberger III  landed a US Airways jet with 155 people aboard in the Hudson River  That represents to many pilots the sort of manual intervention that is sometimes necessary  Hopefully  we ll do something before we begin to have a litany of recent fatal accidents   Mr  Sullenberger said in a recent interview   It could happen tomorrow  It could happen next year  I can t say  But I think it s inevitable if we continue down this path  The issue has become more acute in recent years as aircraft have become more automated and a global pilot shortage has forced carriers to fill their cockpits with less experienced pilots  particularly in emerging markets  At the same time  the stream of military aviators that the big carriers have long relied on is dwindling The most seasoned pilots are aging out of the profession   they are required to retire at age 65 in the United States   and many said their successors might not know how to handle the unexpected  There s nothing wrong with the millennials  they re really sharp and hungry for the information   said Shem Malmquist  a Boeing 777 captain and visiting professor at the Florida Institute of Technology s College of Aeronautics   We re not exposing them   we re not giving them the chance to get the information  Karlene Petitt  an international airline pilot who wrote a Ph D  dissertation about pilot training at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University  said the new training regimen was producing less well rounded pilots  They can punch the buttons  but will they be able to fly that airplane when it breaks   she asked Mr  Sullenberger noted that flight schools  where much of the manual training takes place  were limited because some insurers restricted how much flying students could do in poor visibility ImageAn airliner being recovered from the Hudson River in 2009  The pilot who safely landed the crippled jet  Chesley B  Sullenberger III  said insurance restrictions were limiting bad weather training at flight schools CreditRobert Stolarik for The New York Times They may have never flown in a cloud before   he said Kit Darby  a former United Airlines captain and Boeing flight instructor who now trains pilots at another large carrier  said training for passenger pilots remained exhaustive and still focused on manual skills  including 1 500 hours of flight time and nearly 30 days in simulators  The bigger problem  he said  is the degradation of those skills once pilots get into the cockpit of an advanced passenger jet and begin to rely on autopilot Many airlines encourage pilots to avoid automation when they can  he said  and annual reviews still test their manual skills   When it s a beautiful day  we want you to turn the automation off   he said Mr  Darby and others said airlines in emerging markets were especially reliant on automation  Mr  Darby  who is also a career consultant for young pilots  said those markets had more acute pilot shortages  forcing carriers to rely on automation to cover up some of their aviators  lack of experience  In the Ethiopian Airlines crash this week  one of the pilots had just 200 hours of flight time  less than a seventh of the time the F A A  generally requires to fly a passenger plane After the 2013 Asiana crash  the National Transportation Safety Board found that the carrier  emphasized the full use of all automation and did not encourage manual flight   If the airline allowed pilots to fly manually more often  the pilot most likely would have prevented the crash  the agency said Dennis Tajer  an American Airlines captain and a spokesman for the airline s pilots  union  said Boeing and Airbus had encouraged that sort of reliance on automation by pitching their planes to carriers as capable of being flown by lesser trained pilots  We ve seen insidious marketing of aircraft to accommodate less experienced and perhaps a lower grade of pilot   he said Boeing and Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment Not all pilots are as worried  Some said the advances in safety from automation outweighed any added risks  The data is there that we ve got a good system   said David Williams  a former F A A  inspector   The reduction of training is overridden by the advances in the equipment  
Last year  two satellites the size of cereal boxes sped toward Mars as though they were on an invisible track in space  Officially called MarCO A and MarCO B  they were nicknamed Wall E and EVE  after the animated robots from the Pixar movie  by engineers at NASA They were just as endearing and vulnerable as their namesakes  The satellites  known as cubesats  were sent to watch over NASA s larger InSight spacecraft as it attempted a perilous landing on the surface of Mars at the end of November Constellations of small satellites like the MarCOs now orbit Earth  used by scientists  private companies  high school students and even governments seeking low budget eyes in the skies  But never before had a cubesat traveled 300 million miles into space On Nov  26  as the InSight lander touched down  its status was swiftly relayed back to Earth by the two trailing cubesats  The operation was a success  and the performance of the MarCO satellites may change the way missions operate  enabling cubesats to become deep space travelers in their own right NASA engineers weren t sure what to expect when the MarCO mission launched last May   I think it s opened up so many doors and kind of shattered expectations   said Anne Marinan  a systems engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena  Calif   The fact that we actually got as far as we did with both satellites working was huge   About a month after dropping InSight onto Mars  NASA lost contact with the MarCOs  The agency may attempt to wake them up someday  but for now Wall E and EVE are silently roaming the solar system  proof of a new space exploration technology that almost never got to the launchpad  Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar  Uncanceling the cubesat programThe MarCO mission was canceled repeatedly  After all  the primary goal of NASA s InSight mission was to land a stationary spacecraft on Mars and listen for marsquakes  giving scientists an improved picture of the red planet s internal makeup  And multiple spacecraft orbiting Mars already relay information from its surface back to Earth  The cubesats wouldn t play a direct role in InSight s success or failure  so it was a challenge to persuade NASA to support a nonessential program using unproven technology  The MarCO team fought hard  prevailing at last with the argument that at a cost of only  18 million  the idea was worth taking a chance on  If these two tiny satellites worked well  it would not only mean that similar spacecraft could support big planetary missions in the future  but also that cubesats might carry instruments of their own  Proving the technology s reach could stretch NASA s funding  the engineers said  while creating opportunities for wider exploration of the solar system As InSight safely touched down on Mars  the MarCOs were zipping past the planet  collecting readings from the landing and relaying them home more swiftly than the satellites currently orbiting Mars could  We had some astonishing statistics   said John Baker  manager of the SmallSat program at J P L   We ended up getting 97 percent of all the InSight data back  And that s because we had two small spacecraft at exactly the right position over the planet to receive the signals  ImageA picture taken by the InSight lander on Mars s surface in December CreditNASA  via Associated PressImageMars  seen by the MarCO B cubesat  about 4 700 miles from the planet in November CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesImageFrom left  John Baker  Anne Marinan and Andrew Klesh  engineers who led the MarCO mission at J P L CreditRozette Rago for The New York TimesHaving custom cubesats overhead meant that NASA did not need to use other Martian satellites or worry about their alignment at the time of landing  If future missions tow along their own MarCOs  teams back on Earth may always know how their spacecraft are doing The creativity of their design contributed to the cubesats  success  Before they began constructing the MarCOs  the team made 3D models and used yarn to plan how best to run the guts and wiring inside  The MacGyver like improvisation resulted in part from the program s low budget The cubesats run on solar power  and their propellant is fire extinguisher fluid  Lining the front of both spacecraft are eight pen width nozzles that spray cold gas  The cameras onboard are off the shelf  and the radio is similar to that in an iPhone But it wasn t all easy  On their six month journey to Mars  both cubesats occasionally lost contact with Earth  A couple of months after launch  MarCO B sprang a fuel leak and started spinning out of control  The team thought they d lost it  Management is slowly encroaching upon the room   said Andrew Klesh  MarCO s chief engineer  describing the scene   We started to look at all the data  We broke apart the problem  and within about 24 hours we had MarCO B back under control  Just a day before landing  MarCO B stopped communicating with Earth again  The cubesat came back online just in time  The InSight probe moved into the Martian landing phase that NASA officials know as  seven minutes of terror   and both spacecraft spoke to Earth the entire time The future is getting smallerImageConsoles at mission control at J P L  CreditRozette Rago for The New York TimesWhile inexpensive cubesats like the MarCOs may serve as real time communication relays for future deep space missions  NASA has more adventurous goals in mind  some of which were hinted at in last week s budget proposals by the Trump administration  When we have big spacecraft  you don t want to necessarily take it into a very risky situation   said Mr  Baker   But you can take an inexpensive probe and send it down to search or to get up close to something and examine it  Mr  Baker and others at J P L  are currently working on planetary cubesat missions  One proposal  nicknamed Cupid s Arrow  envisions using the spacecraft to study the opaque atmosphere of Venus In other proposals  the next iteration of interplanetary cubesats would be scouts deployed by larger spacecraft studying worlds that could be hospitable to life  They could be sent into the plumes of Enceladus  Saturn s icy moon  which ejects water vapor into space  Or cubesats could descend toward the surface of Europa  the ocean moon of Jupiter  These spacecraft will allow us to act as the Star Trek probes to go down to the surface of challenging worlds where we might not be able to take the risk of a much larger mission   said Dr  Klesh When NASA s next generation rocket  the Space Launch System  heads for its first practice orbit around the moon  a launch which is facing delays   it will carry 13 cubesats  some as tests of technology and others as science experiments  One cubesat  for example  will be tasked with mapping sources of water on the moon for future human exploration  Another  called NEA Scout  is being designed by Dr  Marinan to monitor nearby asteroids that could pose potential hazards to our planet Private companies are working on shrinking scientific instruments to be placed aboard the next generation of Earth orbiting satellites  And as instruments become smaller  the options for singular scientific missions in deep space become greater  as does the potential for whole fleets of MarCO like satellites Image Lucky peanuts   with homemade MarCO branding  at J P L CreditRozette Rago for The New York TimesToughening tiny travelersBut much work remains before more cubesats can travel beyond the moon  The challenges that come with operating full size planetary missions apply to small satellites  too If you want to go to the Jovian system  you need heavy radiation shielding  If you want to go to Saturn  you need more efficient solar panels and ways to keep the tiny spacecraft warm  We think we can actually send a small spacecraft all the way to Jupiter   said Dr  Baker   The problem is  I have to come up with a way of automating the onboard spacecraft so that it can fly itself to Jupiter or you only have to talk to it once a month  Or we create a way for it to only radio home when it needs help  These are the kinds of engineering challenges the MarCO team worked to overcome with the journey to Mars  It s really opened a door of possibilities now that we have shown that this has actually worked   Dr  Marinan said   It s not an impossible concept anymore The engineers even managed to get around one of the trickier issues with how to collect data and talk to the cubesats  Typically  when a spacecraft calls home  it will spend several hours using NASA s Deep Space Network  the very expensive phone system for calls beyond the moon  But these long distance conversations weren t an option for the MarCOs  So the team at J P L  created new ways of monitoring the spacecraft that allowed them to collect in a one hour period the data that would usually take eight hours  MarCO is a herald of new things to come   said Dr  Klesh   Not necessarily better things  but different  and a new way of space exploration that will complement all the larger missions that we do  As it passed Mars  MarCO B returned the first photo ever taken of Mars from a cubesat  It revealed the copper colored entirety of the planet in the dark of space  and a small section of the spacecraft s antenna  The angle of the photo was intentional   not only to show where we ve been  but a hint at where these tiny wanderers could go next ImageA visitor snaps a picture of a cubesat at J P L CreditMarcio

A conversation with Matt Farwell  author of  American Cipher  Bowe Bergdahl and the U S  Tragedy in Afghanistan   Penguin Press  2019  The same day in June 2009 that Bowe Bergdahl  a 23 year old private first class from Sun Valley  Idaho  walked off his military outpost in Paktika  Afghanistan  Sgt  Matt Farwell received the news that a friend with whom he served in 2007 had overdosed on opioids at his home in Alabama  On the ground in Afghanistan  the Army mobilized a weekslong search for the missing soldier  Back in the United States  the service denied Farwell s friend a military burial because he had a less than honorable discharge for drug use   a habit Farwell says was a result of his deteriorating mental health following their tour in Afghanistan  Farwell and three other soldiers attended the funeral in uniform and delivered an American flag to their friend s family  since the Army wouldn t   I was still reeling from that when I heard a soldier had gone missing in Afghanistan   Farwell says   For the past 10 years  I think I channeled a lot of that grief into interest   to the point of obsession   with the Bergdahl story   Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty  conflict and consequence  Within hours of walking away  Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban  and he was brutally tortured for nearly five years before being returned to the United States  Seven months after Bergdahl disappeared  Farwell s older brother  Chief Warrant Officer Gary Marc Farwell  was killed in a helicopter crash in Germany  One of Farwell s last acts as a soldier was to escort his brother s body home to be buried in eastern Idaho  close to his wife s family  He separated from the Army shortly after  without any plan for what to do next   Four and a half years in the Army  including 16 months as an infantryman in eastern Afghanistan  provided plenty of skills with no legal application in the civilian world   Farwell wrote in 2011 for the At War blog   It was  however  wonderful preparation for being homeless   He tried college but dropped out of two different schools  He spent time in a mental hospital  He drifted to California  where he ran out of money  all while trying to hide from the  ugliness of violent  unpredictable death  he had experienced during his deployment Over time Farwell s unrelenting infatuation with Bergdahl s story helped to propel him out of his own self destruction  He worked on a profile of Bergdahl with Michael Hastings that was published in Rolling Stone in June 2012  Two years later Bergdahl became the linchpin of an American foreign policy decision after he was released in a prisoner exchange negotiated by the Obama administration  which traded him for five Taliban detainees being held at Guantánamo Bay  The media coverage of the prisoner swap turned the soldier into a household name  Bergdahl morphed into a singular figure onto which Americans projected their resentment of the never ending war in Afghanistan  He had abandoned his fellow soldiers  The Army s search for him had put people at unnecessary risk  and at least three service members were wounded during attempted rescue missions  Why were we negotiating with terrorists to get him back in the first place  Even Donald Trump publicly voiced his opinion of Bergdahl during his election campaign  calling Bergdahl a  dirty rotten traitor   The denunciations  fed into the worst instincts of the military  the media and the public   says Farwell  who was disgusted by the response  but also motivated to get the story right ImageCreditvia Penguin PressOn March 12  Penguin Press released  American Cipher  Bowe Bergdahl and the U S  Tragedy in Afghanistan   written by Farwell and Michael Ames  which examines Bergdahl s decision to abandon his post and its cascading effects across the war effort  In late 2015  Bergdahl was the subject of the second season of  Serial   a podcast whose opening season was the first to achieve five million downloads   I also started a podcast at this time with two former military officers  Together we analyzed every episode of the Bergdahl investigation by  Serial    According to  American Cipher    hearing the accused soldier admit his crime to a Hollywood screenwriter on national airwaves  forced the Army to court martial Bergdahl on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy  pushing him even further into the public spotlight  By the time the trial was over  Bergdahl represented more than just his own bad decision  He stood for everything that was wrong with the United States  involvement in Afghanistan  Now Farwell   who was sent to the same province of the same war from which Bergdahl walked away   has returned to the story and produced an honest examination of both Bergdahl and the conflict that drove him to abandon his brothers in arms In late 2017  Bergdahl pleaded guilty to the charges  but faced no jail time  The Army reduced his rank to private  fined him and ordered that he be discharged dishonorably   There would be no ceremony to banish Bergdahl from the military   the epilogue of  American Cipher  reads   Instead  in a spare room in the courthouse  he simply took off his uniform with the sergeant s stripes that he had been deemed no longer fit to wear and changed into civilian clothes   For Farwell  seeing his work in print has finally put his obsession with Bergdahl to rest   I did what I set out to do   Now  he says   I m trying to get over the war  In an interview with The Times  Farwell talked about America s involvement in Afghanistan  the repeated policy failures of multiple presidential administrations and the public s eagerness to shirk responsibility for the country s longest war The book starts back in 1979 with the Russian invasion of Afghanistan  Why there  In 1979  Bergdahl s father  Bob  was an Olympic caliber cyclist  dreaming of a medal   and then American participation in the Olympics was canceled because the Soviets invaded Afghanistan  Bob and Jani Bergdahl responded to this global event by moving to Idaho and starting a family  Jimmy Carter and the United States responded by initiating a huge covert action campaign in Afghanistan to bleed the Soviets  Fast forward 30 years  In 2009  Bob and Jani s son was in Afghanistan  being held captive by the sons of Jalaluddin Haqqani  a man the United States trained and equipped to bleed the Soviets  To tell both stories in parallel  and make people ask why we re still there  it was necessary to explain how events that happened decades ago reverberate in our world today The book covers multiple presidential administrations  How have the policy failures of past presidents affected the war in Afghanistan  When it comes to Afghanistan policy  there are no blameless  or bloodless  hands among any of the American presidents  Democrat or Republican   and this goes back even further than Carter  in fact  to Eisenhower pumping billions into an Idaho based construction company tasked with creating dams and towns called  Little America  in southern Afghanistan  One of the most striking things when examining the continuum of what The Onion aptly called  the quagmire building effort in Afghanistan  in 2009 is when you realize how completely bipartisan it was and is ImageMatt FarwellCreditvia Penguin PressThe failure we now see in that country is an American failure  Jimmy Carter initiated the gigantic covert action campaign that used the C I A  to train the fathers of the men we now fight  Ronald Reagan expanded the program  George H W  Bush abandoned the country after the Soviets left  Bill Clinton ignored the Taliban and decided not to kill bin Laden  The Sept  11 attacks happened  and George W  Bush invaded Afghanistan to get bin Laden and topple the Taliban  even though the hijackers were largely from Saudi Arabia and got their best training in Miami  Phoenix and San Diego  Bush forgot about the war after invading Iraq  and then Barack Obama came in and expanded the Afghan war to cover his political flanks on withdrawal in Iraq  The sad litany of failure can t easily be pinned on any one administration or political party  or even one American institution  but is visible to me every time I go for an appointment at my local veterans  hospital and see broken men and women Do you think the American public s resentment toward Bergdahl has dissipated with time  The hatred of Bergdahl was unwarranted and unfair  We all really failed  As a country  we were bullies  The nation  goaded on by a media with a short attention span and a love of artificial controversy  unfairly projected a lot of the discomfort in the collective American unconsciousness about the war in Afghanistan onto Bergdahl  We didn t do that to Robert Bales  who walked off his base twice and murdered 16 innocent people  After Vietnam  the Pentagon learned more about winning the public relations fight than the battlefield fight I hope the book will show people that all the men and women who fought and sacrificed in Afghanistan are human beings  not the caricatures that soldiers are often made out as  They re human beings who form a tiny minority of Americans who bear the costs of this war and pass it on to their children and their families Do you think that Bergdahl s actions in 2009 were the result of a greater systemic failure within the Army  I m not looking to excuse what Bergdahl did  I m looking to try to explain why he did it  and why it matters  No one made Bergdahl walk off the base besides Bergdahl  He did something that  as a former soldier  bugs the hell out of me  something I never did  He walked away  He pleaded guilty to the desertion charge against him  The Army  from Bergdahl s immediate leadership up the chain to its commander in chief  all share in his failure  If Bergdahl and the Army failed this badly  that indicates a larger failure within the American society that put them in that situation to begin with  As the wars dragged on  fewer and fewer Americans wanted to fight in them  and the Army was having trouble making its recruiting goals and had serious problems with attrition at every rank  So they lowered the bar to enlist   admitting felons  giving waivers to the mentally ill  lowering intelligence and physical standards   to keep their numbers up and keep get fresh bodies into the meat grinder in Afghanistan According to the book  the decision by the podcast  Serial  to make Bergdahl the subject of their second season basically forced the Army to court martial him  Do you think it was unethical of  Serial  to release recordings of their interviews with him I think it was scummy and exploitative  Was the decision by Mark Boal  the season s executive producer  who was originally interviewing Bergdahl so he could make a movie  to tape record a low ranking soldier   a traumatized torture victim facing potential criminal prosecution   for research purposes unethical  Probably not on its own  though it seems exploitative and done under false pretenses to me  It crossed into really gross territory when Boal couldn t secure financing for his film and made the decision to partner with a hot property hipster podcast to gin up some buzz for the project Boal and the  Serial  executive producer Sarah Koenig used the most salacious and self incriminating clips of Bergdahl from the 25 hours of the  background research  audio  and timed the release of the first episode for the week before Abrams made his decision  It s almost twee to talk about whether or not that was ethical  it was a calculated decision on their part  and I don t believe ethics came into it  Expediency did  The last thing I want to do is make it sound as if I think Boal or Koenig had any ethics or values to begin with The book examines the American government s hostage negotiation policies  and it ends with some reforms that created an interagency hostage recovery unit under the Obama administration in June 2015  Why did it take so long for these reforms to happen  and are they enough  This isn t a bug in American policy  it s a feature we pretend doesn t exist  It took a case like Bergdahl s   in which you have an American soldier as the pawn   for people to sit up and notice that the system was broken  For almost five years  Bergdahl  normally under the jurisdiction of the American military  was held in Pakistan  an ostensibly allied country  where only the C I A  was allowed to operate  and they had bigger fish to fry than Bergdahl  The F B I  was claiming that because it was a kidnapping  it was their case  but they lacked the resources to resolve it  The State Department saw it as a way to open wider negotiations and somehow regain relevance in a conflict they had been largely iced out of  Only when Lt  Col  Jason Amerine  who had been one of the first Green Berets into Afghanistan  decided to force the issue   a moment of great integrity at great personal sacrifice   were politicians forced to sit up and take notice and make changes  Is it enough  Probably not  Sweeping policy changes will never be enough for Americans with loved ones still in captivity overseas  and there are plenty of those still What will be lasting impact of the Bergdahl case on the military  I hate to say it  but most likely very little  There are some legal precedents that were set  and it had its ripples on the war  one that is never talked about is how Bergdahl passed along actionable intelligence and lessons learned from captivity to the appropriate military and intelligence authorities  That had a lasting impact  the kind that can be measured in drone strike dates and casualties on a timeline  A lot of the Haqqani network s leadership was killed by C I A  drones following Bergdahl s repatriation  But how do we expect the military to learn from this  if we have trouble doing it as individuals and as a society  Acknowledging that someone like Bergdahl  whom the American public once loudly proclaimed a traitor and tried to further imprison  did more than his fair share to dismantle the terror network that held him captive in an allied country is a really uncomfortable thing to do if you re wedded to a narrative about the war  so for the military it is better just to sweep it all under the rug post court martial and forget about it 
ALGONA  Iowa   It was the kind of question that a politician should have been able to handle with ease  but Representative Steve King is not any politician  Do you think a white society is superior to a nonwhite society   Mary Lavelle  63  asked  testing his reputation for white supremacist sympathies  I don t have an answer for that  That s so hypothetical   Mr  King  Republican of Iowa  told her   I ll say this  America is not a white society   it has never been a completely white society  We came here and joined the Native Americans  He continued   I ve long said that a baby can be lifted out of a cradle anywhere in the world and brought into any home in America  whatever the color of the folks in that household  and they can be raised to be American as any other  And I believe that every one of us  every one of us  is created in God s image  Ms  Lavelle said she asked the question in this northern Iowa town of 5 000 because she worried that anti immigrant language used in a manifesto written by the suspect in the mosque shooting in Christchurch  New Zealand  resembled Mr  King s own talking points  His fumbling answer to a relatively simple query may have done little to allay those concerns  two months after Mr  King  a nine term Republican with a long history of racist comments  was publicly rebuked by members of his own party House Republican leaders removed Mr  King from his committee assignments in January  after comments he made to The New York Times questioned why the phrase  white supremacy  was considered offensive  A number of powerful party leaders  including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  and Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming  the No  3 House Republican  suggested he should resign  and the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution disapproving of Mr  King s statements Mr  King remained defiant after losing his committee seats  and released a statement insisting that his comments had been misunderstood  He said he had been referring only to  Western civilization  when he asked  how did that language become offensive   not  white nationalist  or  white supremacist  Mr  King again faced scrutiny on Monday after a post on his Facebook page speculated who would win a second civil war between red states and blue states  Folks keep talking about another civil war  one side has about 8 trillion bullets while the other side doesn t know which bathroom to use   read the post  which has since been deleted On Tuesday  pressed by a reporter from CNN  Mr  King told constituents that he  wasn t aware  that the image had been published on his Facebook page the night before  and said he does not personally manage that page  I wish it had never gone up   he said But he also sought to deflect the question  telling the reporter   it s interesting that nobody here asked that question   while gesturing to his constituents  The only people who care about that is national news media  Nobody has raised the issue around here   he said  prompting a handful of attendees to protest  The exchange was quickly picked up by American Bridge  a liberal political action committee But Ms  Lavelle clearly did care about Mr  King s incendiary language  After being asked about the manifesto  Mr  King responded at length  He said the author of the manifesto had expressed as much sympathy for Communist China as white supremacy   The further it went  the more inconsistent it became  and he seems to have mixed and matched ideologies   he said Pressed about the overlap between the manifesto s language and his own  Mr  King responded   He also likely used the same words that Mao used  
WASHINGTON   The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the United States economy was slowing more than it had previously thought and painted a far less rosy economic picture than the White House as it left interest rates unchanged and signaled little appetite for raising them again in the near future Jerome H  Powell  the Fed chairman  said the economy  is in a good place  in a news conference  But he and his colleagues said growth appeared to be slowing from last year  under the weight of the Trump administration s trade war  economic slowdowns in Europe and China and fading stimulus from the Republican tax cuts of 2017 The Fed now expects 2 1 percent growth this year  down from the 2 3 percent it forecast in December   and more than a percentage point less than the 3 2 percent growth the White House predicts  The outlook for 2020 is even more bleak  with the Fed now projecting growth of just 1 9 percent The downbeat assessment comes as the Fed sees signs of weakness in areas like consumer spending and business investment  which Mr  Powell said  suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected   Average monthly job growth  while strong   appears to have stepped down from last year s strong pace   he added Mr  Powell tried to reassure markets by saying  economical fundamentals are still very strong   but he acknowledged that recent developments both domestically and abroad were making it harder for the American economy to grow as quickly as it did last year  We see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially   he said  adding that China s economy has also weakened Forecasts released at the end of the two day meeting show the typical member of the Federal Open Market Committee now expects not to raise rates at all this year  an abrupt halt to what had been five consecutive quarters of rate increases to the current range of 2 25 to 2 5 percent  Most officials now expect a single rate increase in 2020 and none in 2021  In December  when forecasts were last released  Fed officials said they expected two rate increases this year and another in 2020 Mr  Powell showed little concern about inflation   which has stayed below the Fed s 2 percent target   rising to levels that would trigger an immediate rate increase in order to prevent a rapid escalation of prices across the economy Instead  Mr  Powell did not rule out the possibility   based on the current condition of the economy   that the central bank s next move could be a rate cut   The data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another   he said By signaling it will not raise rates without a clear change in conditions  the Fed is effectively giving Mr  Trump what he wants from monetary policy  but with a twist  The president has publicly pushed Mr  Powell to stop raising rates  But if the Fed is correct and growth falls well below 3 percent this year  without a single rate increase  it will be difficult for Mr  Trump to pin the blame on Mr  Powell The 1 9 percent growth the Fed now expects in 2020 is down from a 2 percent forecast in December  But the projections include even worse possibilities  At least one committee member forecasts growth of only 1 6 percent for 2019  In December  the lowest forecast was 2 percent for the year White House officials see growth staying above 3 percent for the next few years  provided Mr  Trump can continue implementing his economic agenda  including another round of tax cuts  a  1 trillion infrastructure plan and additional deregulation Most private forecasters  growth predictions for this year run closer to the Fed s than the White House s  That includes the chief executives of the Business Roundtable  who said in a quarterly survey released Wednesday that their expectations for sales  hiring and investment fell at the start of the year  They predict the economy will grow 2 5 percent in 2019 The gap between White House and Fed forecasts has never been wider in the years since the Great Recession ended in 2009  The two outlooks have clashed in the past   during the terms of Presidents George Bush and George W  Bush   for fundamental reasons  said Diane Swonk  the chief economist at Grant Thornton  One is a forecast that is meant to be as accurate as possible and produce the best monetary policy outcomes   Ms  Swonk said   The other is a forecast that can t escape political and ideological desires  The diverging forecasts underscore the differences in how the administration and the Fed judge both the risks to economic growth this year and the evidence that Mr  Trump s tax cuts have fundamentally strengthened the economy Administration officials insist that the  1 5 trillion tax cut will continue to accelerate business investment and draw more and more workers into the labor force  accelerating growth  Mr  Trump promoted his economic plan in Lima  Ohio  on Wednesday  saying it would produce record job and wage growth  We just came out  another chart  we just came out with numbers  the economic report of the president  3 1 percent G D P   the first time in 14 years   Mr  Trump said  referring to data showing economic output rose 3 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a year earlier  While the Fed expressed concern that Mr  Trump s trade policies could drag down growth  the president said his tariffs on imported metals and Chinese goods were bringing jobs back to America  Everyone said you couldn t do it  you couldn t bring back manufacturing jobs   he said   You would need a magic wand  We are bringing them back beyond anybody s expectations  Where the Fed Stands on Future Interest RatesParticipants of the Federal Open Market Committee have lowered their projections of interest rates in the coming years

the Great Recession  It has been slowly winnowing those holdings as the economy has recovered Many analysts had expected officials to announce the September end of the balance sheet wind down  which Mr  Powell had foreshadowed in a recent speech at Stanford University  By October  the Fed said on Wednesday  officials will be shifting the composition of the balance sheet  moving out of agency debt and mortgage backed securities and into primarily Treasury bonds Officials appeared to hasten to end the balance sheet reduction under pressure from financial markets  Many analysts blamed stock market volatility in December and January on the Fed s wind down process In announcing the end of the reduction  Fed officials acknowledged that they were stopping short of what many analysts had expected when the reduction began  They said the total holdings on the balance sheet once the wind down ends  will likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy  Carrying a larger than expected balance sheet   and operating with interest rates at what remain historically low levels   could hinder the Fed in battling an economic downturn in the near future 
WASHINGTON   President Trump declared on Tuesday morning that the husband of one of his top aides  Kellyanne Conway  was a  total loser   On Wednesday morning  he doubled down  describing him as a  stone cold LOSER   husband from hell  The husband in question  George T  Conway III  a prominent conservative lawyer  has been publicly critical of Mr  Trump for months  But in recent days he has escalated those attacks on Twitter by reigniting a conversation about the president s mental health and saying Mr  Trump was a malignant narcissist who fits the profile for narcissistic personality disorder Aides have been pressing Mr  Trump to simply ignore Mr  Conway  who in a phone interview on Tuesday said he viewed it as a  badge of honor  to be called a loser by someone he believes is unfit to hold the nation s highest office  and said the president s reaction only  proves the point I made yesterday  Mr  Trump s attack on Mr  Conway was not unusual for the language he used or for the medium through which he employed it  Over the past two years  Mr  Trump has proved that trivial  personal fights are not a distraction from the work he is doing in office  but a core feature of the image he wants to project He called Rex W  Tillerson  his former secretary of state   dumb as a rock  and  lazy as hell  after Mr  Tillerson criticized him in an interview last December for being undisciplined  He has taken the bait on almost every negative book written about him by a former staff member or a journalist  helping to elevate those tomes to the best seller lists by declaring  via Twitter  that their authors are  a mess    Cliff Sims   a  lowlife   Omarosa Manigault Newman  or an  idiot   Bob Woodward  Returning fire with fire is part of the president s modus operandi that aides around him have internalized  On Tuesday  Mr  Trump made clear that he would hit back at criticism  even if the critic was the spouse of one of his most loyal and longest serving aides Singling out Ms  Conway s husband for presidential critique put the focus back on one of Washington s most discussed marriages  even as Ms  Conway has tried to defuse the coverage of her husband by not commenting about him on the record because  she has told friends  of how it would affect her children Mr  Trump appeared to be provoked by a tweet from his campaign manager  Brad Parscale  who wrote   We all know that  realDonaldTrump turned down Mr  Kellyanne Conway for a job he desperately wanted  He barely worked  TheJusticeDept and was either fired quit  didn t want the scrutiny  Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success  POTUS doesn t even know him  In fact  Mr  Conway withdrew his name from consideration for a top job at the Justice Department  running its civil division  before he ever started  And he has known Mr  Trump for decades  since he lived in Manhattan at Trump World Tower and declined to sit on the condo board  a spot that his wife took in his stead In more recent history  Mr  Conway spent time with Mr  Trump on election night and at the wedding of the Treasury secretary  Steven Mnuchin  in June 2017  when Mr  Trump even commended him on turning down the job because it would have meant reporting to a  weak  leader  former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Since Mr  Conway has become more vocal in his criticism of the president  Mr  Trump has referred to him repeatedly as  Mr  Kellyanne Conway  and claimed that in his diatribes against the president  he is simply trying to gain attention through the reflected glory of his wife  On Wednesday  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter that Mr  Conway   often referred to as Mr  Kellyanne Conway by those who know him  is VERY jealous of his wife s success   angry that I  with her help  didn t give him the job he so desperately wanted  In an interview  Mr  Conway dismissed the idea that he was coasting off interest in his wife  and said that in the course of a long marriage  it is hard to separate who is responsible for whose fortune and fame  The way we structured our lives before the campaign  it enabled her to build her business so she could become the campaign manager   said Mr  Conway  who was previously a partner at the law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen   Katz   I helped in ways that enabled her to go off and be the campaign manager  and go off to the White House in the spring of 2017  When the couple relocated its family to Washington from New Jersey  Mr  Conway gave up his partner status at the law firm  which does not have an office in the District of Columbia  and became  of counsel  Mr  Conway said his motivation to publicly attack the president had been driven  at least in part  by feeling responsible for having played a small role in electing him  even if it was a tangential one of supportive spouse to the campaign manager  There is a little bit of guilt there   he said   There s some of that   He wasn t my first choice   Mr  Conway added   He wasn t her first choice  He was the last choice  in terms of the last person standing   But Mr  Conway said his wife was now all in for the president  much to his chagrin   At this point  yes she is   he said Ms  Conway  who led a briefing on Mr  Trump s initiative to stop opioid abuse on Tuesday morning and was set to personally brief the president on the administration s achievements later in the day  declined to comment  Speaking to reporters on Monday  Ms  Conway said she did not share her husband s view of the president s mental health Critics of Mr  Conway have noted that Mr  Trump revealed himself fully during the campaign  and has not changed  What has changed  in fact  is Mr  Conway s view of him  I had assumed and hoped that the gravity of the office would lead him to something greater   Mr  Conway said   That respect for the office  respect for history and the desire to leave a legacy would lead him to see that there is something beyond himself that he needs to achieve   But Mr  Conway said that  on Day 1  his focus on the crowds  it was clear almost instantaneously that he s not capable of it  A lifelong Republican  Mr  Conway said he had not ruled out supporting a Democrat in 2020   It depends on what they say   he said   but under no circumstances would I vote or support Trump  Some followers of the White House s personal dramas believe the Conways are playing both sides and looking for a big payday if Ms  Conway decides to leave the administration  But Mr  Conway said that a Mary Matalin James Carville style road show was an unlikely outcome  I almost wish that were so   he said   This is just my way of expressing my views about something I find thoroughly maddening  which is the utter incompetence and mendacity of the president and the administration  I don t end up getting in arguments at home about it

WARSAW   One night in April 2017  Jakub Skrzywanek was inside the Powszechny Theater in Warsaw  pushing tables against the windows to barricade himself and actors inside  Outside were dozens of protesters   a mix of hard line Roman Catholics and right wing activists   hoping to stop a production of  The Curse   a provocative play about child sexual abuse in the church  It was really scary   Mr  Skrzywanek  27  an assistant director on  The Curse   said in an interview   I m having to tell everyone   It s O K    and I m scared  The furor at the Powszechny  pronounced pov SHECK ny  was one of the first signs that Poland s theaters would be at the forefront of the country s culture wars  which pit liberals against the governing populist Law and Justice Party  as well as other conservative groups and the Catholic Church Many theaters would keep a low profile after a protest  but now the Powszechny  whose slogan is  Theater that gets in the way  is courting controversy again with the opening of a play directed by Mr  Skrzywanek   Mein Kampf   with all the dialogue taken from the book by Hitler  The cultural field is a war field right now   said Tomasz Thun Janowski  the director of the city of Warsaw s cultural department  which gives funding to the city s theaters  including the Powszechny Poland s government  sees theater as a way of creating some sort of national identity   he said  It has focused on one off grants to theaters that stage traditional plays  he added   The government wants to build rather conservative  rather nationalistic  tendencies in the theater   he said Piotr Glinski  Poland s culture minister  said that the government had  been building new kinds of institutions  since the Law and Justice party was elected in 2015  and it wanted them to be patriotic   Thanks to such institutions we can regain our memory   as a free nation  as a community   he wrote in an email Mr  Skrzywanek  the director  said he wanted  Mein Kampf  to show how divisive Poland s politics has become   I want to show that the language used by politicians  by everyone  in Poland is worse than the language of Hitler   he said  The fallout from the murder of the liberal mayor of Gdansk in January was the most recent example of the toxic political climate in the country  The killer was a disturbed individual but all sides used it for aggressive political point scoring  National elections are scheduled for October ImageProtesters outside the Powszechny Theater in Warsaw in May 2017  where  The Curse   was being performed  The sign reads  Protect the cross from Giewont   a mountain in the south of Poland   to the Baltic Sea  CreditMaciej Luczniewski NurPhoto  via Getty ImagesAnti Semitism is also rising in Poland  Mr  Skrzywanek said   A  far right tabloid  recently published an article telling its readers  how to spot  a Jew  He wants  Mein Kampf  to stir reflection  he said  if it is protested  he will feel he has failed  But  If the government wants to make a scandal  it will  In 2017  Poland s government withheld funds from two theater festivals  one because it planned to stage  The Curse   another  because Oliver Frjlic   The Curse s  director  was one of the festival s curators   Mr  Glinski said these are just two examples from  dozens of decisions   The government directly finances four large theaters   The Powszechny is not one of them   But Mr  Skrzywanek said he felt the controversies were also having an impact on the country s many regional and local theaters  which were avoiding plays that might cause upset  Local governments that fund those theaters know that  political art is never good for them   he said   It s better for them if it s just crazy Ceasars and old farces  In February  the mayor of Rzeszow stopped rehearsals of a play at the city s theater that discussed sexual abuse and compared the Polish Catholic Church to Judas  the betrayer of Jesus   People are saying it was the most violent act of censorship since 1989   said Pawel Passini  the play s director  referring to the year when Poland began its transition to democracy  A spokesman for the mayor denied any censorship  and said in an email that the mayor just wanted to  draw attention  to parts of the show that could cause religious conflict Mr  Thun Janowski  of the city of Warsaw  said the Powszechny is different from most theaters in Poland and less susceptible to pressure  There is a saying in the country  he said    If you want a peaceful afternoon  don t go to the theater   The guys from the Powszechny believe that  The Powszechny s artistic director  Pawel Lysak  54  said that he wanted the theater to cause a stir since he became its head in 2014  A play should always contain  something difficult  something provocative  something to change the world   he said But the protests against  The Curse  came as a surprise  he said  The initial mass demonstrations involved up to 1 500 people held back by dozens of police  They lasted only three days  but during the play s run  protesters set off a smoke grenade in the theater  sent death threats to the actors and box office staff and poured butyric acid  sometimes used in stink bombs  in the theater causing it to close for a month Members of Poland s government accused the theater of insulting the Catholic Church  and prosecutors opened a blasphemy investigation  When we were having to take care of our actors and our audience  I thought   Should I be doing this  It s dangerous to them    Mr  Lysak said   But ideologically  we never doubted it   The church has a strong influence in Poland and its role needs to be discussed  he said  Poland should also reflect on its turn to the right  he added  That was why he is putting on  Mein Kampf  ImageActors during a rehearsal for  Mein Kampf   From left  Oskar Stoczynski  Natalia Lagiewczyk and Arkadiusz Brykalski CreditMagda Hueckel On the right side  they have a very strong project  God  country  blood  religion  family and honor   he said   So if we don t agree with this national project  we need our own  Mr  Glinski  the culture minister  said that the Powszechny  expresses radical views and is a part of current political dispute in Poland   He mentioned a scene in  The Curse  that involved an actress simulating oral sex on a statue of John Paul II  the first Polish pope  which was shown on state TV and partly caused the protests   Can you imagine the scenes of oral sex with the symbols of Judaism or Islam on Broadway   he said  There has always been room for provocation in the theater   Mr  Glinski added   The question is what purpose this provocation should serve  It is easy to see that  Mein Kampf  could offend Catholics and conservatives in a similar vein  At one point  a replica of the  Black Madonna of Czestochowa   one of Poland s most revered Catholic icons  will be lowered into view  Mr  Skrzywanek said  and the actors will whitewash her face In another scene  an actor will wear a mask of Jaroslaw Kaczynski  the founder of the Law and Justice Party  while speaking Hitler s words  Mr  Skrzywanek said  The character will later be murdered onstage  he added   In a text message  Mr  Skrzywanek later said these plans had changed  But at a recent rehearsal  the actors didn t seem worried about the play s provocations  They first rehearsed an absurd scene set in an art gallery  during which two actors voice Hitler s disapproval of modern art while others pretend to be exhibits  They then rehearsed a powerful scene  set around a dinner table  where the characters spoke anti Semitic diatribes from the book as if they were like polite conversation  while sipping soup Mr  Skrzywanek watched from the side of the room  with his feet on a chair  He said little but occasionally gasped with excitement After the rehearsal  Mr  Skrzywanek said he felt a lot of pressure around the play  The play s first run was close to selling out   It s much bigger interest than  The Curse    he said   People are totally waiting for it and no one knows what to expect  The Law and Justice party s politicians only become interested in important plays  he added   I think this may be one  But he insisted his aim was not to stir Poland s culture wars   Mein Kampf  was meant to be critical of Poland s liberals  and their aggressive language  as well as conservatives  he said   For me  that s really the most radical gesture you can do in Polish theater   Mr  Skrzywanek said   to not accuse a specific group of people  but everyone  
To the Editor Re  Seeking Clues Behind Trump s Weekend Twitter Barrage   news article  March 19  For over two years we have watched President Trump become more and more unhinged  This past weekend should have been a frightening experience for even the most casual observer of our political situation  His disjointed attacks on the Mueller investigation and irrational rants against the late Senator John McCain should make his enablers in Congress more than nervous It is getting harder to ignore that we apparently have an emotionally unbalanced individual as our chief executive  For Congress to ignore these obvious signs is a dereliction of duty  Ted DicksonNew YorkTo the Editor President Trump s recent tweets do not mean that he is unraveling or a madman  he is just throwing a temper tantrum  All his adult life he has surrounded himself with sycophants who catered to his every whim  Fox News has been filling that role by stroking his ego A plausible reason for the recent tweets is not necessarily the Mueller investigation or the rebuke from Congress on his emergency declaration  but more likely that Fox News suspended the  Justice With Judge Jeanine  show Saturday night   After a Rare Public Rebuke  Fox News Suspends a Host  to the President s Chagrin   news article  March 18   His cuddly bear and enabler was taken away from him  and he lashed out like a spoiled little boy  But through denial and more projection and maybe a rally or numerous likes on his Twitter feed  he will be back to his old grandiose self in a few days  George Magakis Jr Norristown  Pa To the Editor So much attention is being paid to President Trump s tweets  the Mueller investigation  terrorism  immigration  But how about focusing on a truly inspiring story of the indomitable strength of the family  the foundation of society  If Kellyanne and George Conway can keep it together  despite Mr  Conway s questioning the president s mental fitness  there s hope for all of us Tom FritschlerPort Angeles  Wash 
Forty years ago  C Span went live with its first public broadcast from the House of Representatives chamber  giving Americans a television shaped window into how lawmakers behave in the ornate room where history is often made Ushering in the C Span era on March 19  1979  was Al Gore  then a representative from Tennessee  who had pushed for the network s access to the Capitol  From this day forward   Mr  Gore said at the time   every member of this body must ask himself or herself  how many Americans are listening to the debates which are made  Since that day  when C Span debuted with four employees  the network has become a mainstay in American politics  We spoke with Susan Swain  one of C Span s two chief executives  about the birth of the network  Washington s initial resistance to being caught on camera and how the network has adapted to the social media age ImageSusan Swain  one of two chief executives at C Span  in a control booth at the studio  Ms  Swain joined C Span three years after it started and continues to appear on air CreditChris Maddaloni Roll Call  via Getty ImagesThis interview with Ms  Swain  who joined C Span three years after it started  has been edited for brevity and clarity In the moment that Al Gore approached the lectern in the House chamber and C Span went live  what changed in American politics The fact that people could actually see their elected representatives in their living room   and now on their phones   was a fundamental change  In the past  people might pull the lever every two years for their member of Congress and  if they were super engaged  might read a newsletter that came in the mail or go to an occasional town hall meeting This meant that any time you were interested  you could watch what your member of Congress had to say  Prior to television in Congress  the only time that members really got attention is if they had big names like Kennedy or if they did something outrageous  either positively or negatively  or if they were a member of the leadership Initially  there was a lot of resistance in Washington to the idea of C Span broadcasting House floor debates  And the Senate didn t allow C Span in for another seven years  Why was there such resistance Members had concerns that the cameras would be swinging around and taking pictures of members while they were not focused attentively on the debates or   heaven forbid   closing their eyes for a second  Or today  perhaps they might be sending out a tweet One of the ways this finally came to bear was that they created a compromise that members could live with  The compromise was that the House of Representatives  the speaker s office  would control the cameras that were on the floor of the House  All the rest of Congress  press conferences and hearings  it s C Span or other news organizations covering them independently Every time there s a change of speaker we have sent a letter saying   Now s the time  Allow C Span or other journalistic organizations to put our own cameras in side by side   That argument continues to go nowhere ImageAbout a month before C Span s widespread debut  the network transmitted the broadcast to televisions in the offices of House members  This is a clip from The New York Times when that limited broadcast began Were politicians self conscious about how they d appear on camera  I think more so there was the concern that they wouldn t be in control of the picture  The Senate finally acquiesced and it s a classic story of American politics The House was coming into people s living rooms via C Span and then regularly on the nightly news because what we did could be picked up regularly for nightly stories about the House  Television loves pictures  so they would do more stories about the House  The Senate was becoming concerned that it was becoming the second tier citizen of Congress The person who was really most instrumental is Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia  who had been one of the old line members who was very much an institutionalist and very much concerned about how the Senate would change  He went home to West Virginia to speak and was introduced in West Virginia  his home state  as the speaker of the House  And it s because he had a big shock of white hair  as did the then Speaker of the House Tip O Neill  And this brought it all home to him  So he convinced some of the recalcitrant members  they did a vote and C Span went on in June of 1986 What is one of your most significant memories from your time at C Span The day that the Challenger shuttle exploded we were televising it live  and I believe I was on the air as the shuttle was going up  And it became very clear as you watched that picture of the shuttle that this was a major catastrophe We sat and watched as long as NASA took pictures  and then the story began to unfold  Then we opened up our phone lines  There was just an incredible outpouring from around the country of people witnessing this absolute tragedy  human tragedy and also technological tragedy unfold in front of their eyes C Span has given politicians a platform to connect directly with their constituents  but now they can do that on social media  Is C Span still relevant C Span s relevance comes in the form of not only all of the events that we cover every day but within minutes after we televise them  they are digitized and stored on our video archives  It has 250 000 hours of political video that we ve covered since 1987 That means a member of Congress can pull a clip from their hearing and send it out to constituents  It also means that people on social media or late night comedians have immediate access to this I think most people who are in their 20s or younger  if they have an experience with C Span it is through social media  it is through the late night comedians  The creation of our video library in 1987 was every bit as significant as the original creation of C Span C Span has long fought for cameras to be allowed in the Supreme Court chamber  What are the chances that you ll succeed I feel a little bit like it s Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill  What we have documented over the years is that when people are nominated to the Supreme Court they go into their committee hearings expressing their open mind to the concept  and then once they get inside that chamber of nine  they manage to be convinced by the others there that it would be detrimental to the institution We keep hoping that as the generations change and younger appointees come in who are very familiar with media and even social media  that the attitude will change  But the institution continues to prevail 
MOSCOW   The oldest daughter of Kazakhstan s longstanding  autocratic president was elected Parliament speaker on Wednesday  fueling speculation that she would succeed her father as the country s ruler after elections next year The appointment of Dariga Nazarbayeva came a day after her father  Nursultan Nazarbayev  who had led the oil rich Central Asian nation since 1989  when it was still part of the Soviet Union  made the surprising announcement that he was stepping down as president Mr  Nazarbayev  78  retained significant power  however  as head of the Security Council and the ruling party  It remained unclear whether someone from his close circle of political advisers or from his family will emerge to run the opaque system  They have opened an era of uncertainty   said Marlene Laruelle  the director of the Central Asia Program at George Washington University in Washington Mr  Nazarbayev may seek to maintain a family hand on the tiller  analysts said  to protect its considerable assets and its impunity  It would mean a continuation of the system   said Nargis Kassenova  a fellow at Harvard University s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies Ms  Nazarbayeva might not emerge as the first choice  however  not least because of a messy divorce that played out on the international stage and the death of her former husband in an Austrian jail cell An amateur opera singer who sometimes performs on public occasions  Ms  Nazarbayeva  55  has been in and out of the government for years  including serving a stint as deputy prime minister She and her husband  Rakhat Aliyev  a surgeon  amassed a fortune by controlling a media and banking empire  Mr  Aliyev was one of the country s most powerful and loathed men  holding senior posts in the domestic intelligence agency and the foreign ministry  as well as serving as head of the tax police Things first started to go wrong in 2004  when his reported mistress  a Russian television personality  was found dead on a Beirut street  having fallen from a tall apartment building In 2007  Mr  Aliyev  then ambassador to Austria  criticized his father in law for altering Kazakhstan s Constitution to allow him to remain president for life ImageRakhat Aliyev in 2007  The ex husband of Ms  Nazarbayeva died in an Austrian prison cell CreditC  J  Chivers The New York TimesWithin a month  Mr  Aliyev was stripped of all his government posts and soon afterward  he maintained  forcibly divorced as well as separated from his three children  Some European nations began investigating him for money laundering In Kazakhstan  he was convicted in absentia of various crimes  but Austria refused to extradite him  Mr  Aliyev married an Austrian women and produced a book called  Godfather in Law  that accused Mr  Nazarbayev of running the country like a mafia don Mr  Aliyev was eventually forced to surrender to the Austrian authorities  who decided to try him in the kidnapping and murder of two Kazakh bank officials Before the case went to trial  however  he was found dead in February 2015  hanging from a coat hook in the bathroom of his solitary prison cell in Vienna  Austria ruled the death a suicide  He was 52 Any presidential election campaign by Ms  Nazarbayeva would likely revive that chapter  which opened a window on nepotism  corruption and other sordid practices within Kazakhstan s elite In the meantime  however  the country affirmed the personality cult around Mr  Nazarbayev even as he stepped aside from the day to day running of the country Mr  Nazarbayev handpicked his successor  Kassym Jomart Tokayev  a former prime minister and foreign minister  who had been Parliament speaker until anointed as acting president Mr  Tokayev  65  used his inaugural address on Wednesday to encourage young Kazakhs to be more active in the development of their country  He also called on Parliament to change the name of the capital  Astana  to Nursultan  and for all towns to rename their main streets after Mr  Nazarbayev Parliament  with Mr  Nazarbayev watching the proceedings from the highest seat in the house  voted 145 to 0 to rename the capital The change did not exactly come as a surprise  The university that opened in Astana in 2009 soon became Nazarbayev University  while a network of elite grade schools are called the Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools The airport in the capital was named for him on his birthday in 2017 Nazarbayev  the last surviving president in Central Asia to have steered his country to independence after the Soviet Union collapsed  often jailed political opponents or journalists who criticized him Analysts suggested he stepped aside to organize an orderly transition that would preserve his legacy  and because the country s economy had stagnated in recent years  despite its massive oil reserves 
Within days of his announcement that he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination  Beto O Rourke shot up in the rankings in terms of money  media coverage and Google searches  Then the knives came out   progressives  women  African Americans and party loyalists all took a stab at him The response to Beto is polarizing the Democratic activist community  The overriding question for Democrats is electability  who can beat Trump is a matter of pressing concern and profound anxiety for at least half the nation  The wrong choice would be disastrous Let s start with O Rourke s negatives and we ll get to the positives later  I ve been quite critical of O Rourke because I don t really think the 2020 race needs him  We already have a pretty good bench of Democrats  and they mostly have thought far more about policy and politics than O Rourke has   Sean McElwee  a co founder of Data for Progress  whose views represent those of many on the outspoken left  told me I think he s vulnerable because of his gaffes and vague policies  but I think he s most weak due to his pretty pro development tenure on the El Paso City Council McElwee contended that O Rourke isno more electable than Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren and would be far less prepared to staff and run a White House  He s never shown a commitment to progressive policies in the past  why should we trust him now  We don t need a superstar  we need someone ready to push all out to implement the progressive agenda Gina Glantz  a co founder of GenderAvenger  an organization determined to ensure  women are represented in the public dialogue   replied to my inquiry about O Rourke I must admit after a few days of watching and reading about his opening gatherings I am less rather than more intrigued  To me  he exudes a sense of entitlement  which I find off putting How about O Rourke and the white working class Paul A  Sracic  a political scientist as Youngstown State University  emailed me O Rourke s vague   We all need to come together  message will not resonate with people who see life as a battle  Working class voters believe in pugilistic politics  And I suspect that O Rourke s punk rock background will seem odd to working class voters  These voters want to feel as if their candidates are  one of them  Negative coverage in the press has been abundant  The Unbearable Male Privilege of Beto O Rourke   The Daily Beast   He voted for Republican legislation  The Wall Street Journal   He put his adolescent fantasies into print  The Resurgent   He s a wealthy dilettante  The National Review   an empty shell  The New Republic   a teenage hacker  USA Today   a master class in male entitlement  The Guardian  At the same time  O Rourke has captured the imagination of millions of voters and donors Frank Wilkinson  a former colleague of mine  wrote at Bloomberg O Rourke is not the only candidate modeling decency as an antidote to Trumpism  But he s the one who has best harnessed the anxiety and rage generated by Trumpism s assaults on democratic values and transformed them into willful  defiant optimism Don Fowler  former chair of the Democratic National Committee  captures this feeling   He clearly possesses a charismatic charge  a spark that few others have   Still  Fowler goes on to enumerate O Rourke s liabilities His impressive campaign for the Senate in Texas was a combination of luck and a damaged opponent  His ability to conduct an effective national campaign is totally unknown  His recent tour of the country was essentially by himself   a very poor way to test a candidate s national potential in a crowded  competitive field  As to issues  the same unknown quality of his organizational potential characterizes his policy and ideological stances  Both major prongs of a national campaign are truly unknown and must be tested in the public crucible  Only time will tell on both policy and operational scores   wait and see A Texas Democratic operative lavished praise on Beto  on background  in order to speak freely O Rourke has an intangible energy that goes beyond the litmus test  On a national scale that could be monumental  It s emotional  It s not tangible  Beto tapped into something with nontraditional voters  People who never publicly supported a campaign were putting Beto signs in their yard  LeBron James wore his logo on a hat  I first saw the momentum in late spring 2018   reports the Republican strategist Scott Reed I live in Dallas and saw the yard signs popping up  all in front of large homes and mansions that would traditionally have been straight G O P  It almost became a badge of courage for many of the limousine liberals in Dallas Reed  who ran Bob Dole s 1996 presidential campaign  went on His Willie Nelson event in Austin drew 50k folks and was also a strong signal to young voters   even though very few voted  His performances in the debates was exceptional and added to his momentum  Cruz was the  1 G O P  fund raiser and he got swamped every quarter  I see a little Bobby Kennedy in him Richard Murray  a political scientist at the University of Houston  was also impressed  He emailed His appeal in Texas is a combination of an attractive persona with animated mannerisms that come across as cool and authentic to many  especially those under 35   boundless energy plus exceptional verbal skills that enable him to weave stories from folks he s encountered on the campaign trail into compelling narratives  a rare skill    displayed in an environment where voters in our very diverse and fast growing metropolitan areas have soured on the far right turn of Texas GOP leaders like Ted Cruz and Dan Patrick How about a national campaign Will this combination work in a national primary featuring the most diverse set of competitors in the nation s history  I do not know  nor does anyone else  But the retail politics states of Iowa and New Hampshire are great places to test his road show outside the Lone Star State Murray s son  Keir Murray  a Democratic political consultant in Texas  added more praise My own sense is his appeal was based  in part  on being a natural foil to Cruz  who is pretty much loathed by all but true conservatives in Texas  and by extension to Trump  O Rourke is self effacing  low key guy  who comes across as fundamentally decent  I don t think most Democrats  liberals or everyday Texans knew much about his policy positions  or cared much  They liked him  People sensed he was being himself   not perfect  not having all the answers   but honest and good hearted Robert Stein  a political scientist at Rice  is upbeat on O Rourke s prospects  He wrote me Shortly after the November election progressives hit him hard for not backing their issue positions on guns and energy  My sense is that he is looking to avoid being defined on a left right dimension continuum  It seems like he is trying to define his candidacy as humane  pragmatic and capable of beating Trump Stein argues thathe is sufficiently retail for places like Iowa and New Hampshire and if he can survive the rush before Super Tuesday  he should come out of the March primaries in the upper echelon of remaining candidates Although O Rourke lost the Texas Senate race to Cruz by just under 3 percent  exit polls show that he won among women  54 46  among voters under 45  59 40  minorities  69 31  college graduates  51 48  moderates  65 34  and voters who say they are not white born again or evangelical Christians  61 38 While suffering from some hostile media impressions  O Rourke has gotten his share  if not more so  of favorable press He s authentic  full of energy  and stripped of consultant driven sterility  Vanity Fair   Will Beto O Rourke Become President   Texas Monthly   Beto O Rourke Rivals Trump on Social Media  Newsweek   Beto O Rourke could lead a blue wave in Texas  Vox   Beto O Rourke blows up the 2020 Democratic primary  Politico  At the same time  some of the strongest opposition to O Rourke   reflecting schisms within the Democratic Party   has come from women s rights advocates  many of whom took offense at a comment he made to Vanity Fair   Man  I m just born to be in it  Natasha Korecki  a Politico reporter  captured the feminist opposition to O Rourke in her March 15 story    Not one woman got that kind of coverage   Beto backlash begins  Korecki wrote The breathless  sweeps like cable television coverage that greeted the former Texas congressman s first campaign events stunned and frustrated many Democratic operatives   particularly women   who viewed it as an example of the double standard at work in the historically diverse presidential field  To them  O Rourke  a white  male candidate had already been anointed the next sensation  his entry into the race greased by live television shots and O Rourke centric panels Celinda Lake  a Democratic pollster  told Politico   I think if you look at the pattern  there is a real distinction between the way men were covered and the way the women were covered  There s a huge double standard   before adding With women  many  many more negatives were raised and the men were treated like the Second Coming  I m surprised that this is continuing in 2019  after the year of the woman In response to the animosity  O Rourke indicated that he would pick a woman as his vice presidential running mate  On March 15  he told reporters   It would be very difficult not to select a woman with so many extraordinary women who are running right now  O Rourke appears to be acutely sensitive to this issue  He told Vanity Fair  before he announced his bid  that  the government at all levels is overly represented by white men   and he didn t leave it there That s part of the problem  and I m a white man  So if I were to run  I think it s just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country  If I were to run  if I were to win  that my administration looks like this country  It s the only way I know to meet that challenge It s not altogether clear  however  that women currently seeking the top job would be thrilled by O Rourke s offer of the number two spot Washington political professionals are also going to be a hard sell John Lawrence  former chief of staff for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  questions whether O Rourke is up to the challenge  Lawrence says he finds it difficultto see a white male emerging from the multicandidate pack  True  all the women minorities could divide up the other voters  but with proportionate allocation of delegates  it s hard to see a white male moderate emerging with a majority  Freshness only goes so far   Lawrence pointed out After a year of being beat up by competitors  the press  Trump  grass roots  etc   he might not look or sound so  fresh   He strikes me as somewhat superficial  very much a personality  I am not convinced the act sells on a national basis Isaac Hale  a political scientist at the University of California  notes thatBeto doesn t have the luxury of running in the Democratic presidential primary as  not Ted Cruz   which is certainly a large part of what endeared him to Democratic voters around the country in 2018 O Rourke  Hale observes   is something of a blank slate that voters and party elites can project their own policy preferences onto   a characteristic that can work to his advantage or disadvantage Lynn Vavreck  a political scientist at U C L A   looked at the same issue from a different angle The ways these races get framed depends a lot on who the candidates are and what their constraints are   if O Rourke finds himself in a race against another young white male who is inspiring  these things won t be a strength of his  but if he finds himself running against an older person who isn t inspiring  they could be Vavreck added Your constraints are only constraints if your opponent doesn t share them  and your strengths are only strengths if your opponent doesn t share them  When there are 16 people vying for the nomination you have to winnow the field to be able to talk sensibly about who has advantages beyond just fund raising and organization  Are there no other candidates who have  capacity to inspire    policy centrism  In the current contest  Vavreck declared   There are  This makes me think that these may not be unique strengths of this candidate  Suzanne Model  a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has written extensively on race and immigration  argues that O Rourke faces an uphill battle for the nomination O Rourke will do well in the primaries but it is unlikely that he will win  Young  handsome and self effacing  his charismatic manner will appeal to  non policy wonks   This includes traditionally oriented women  young adults  and political moderates  In addition  his recent pro immigrant stance  Hispanic sounding name and Texas roots should garner him support among Latinos But  Model continued O Rourke s problem is that he has little appeal to left leaning voters or African Americans  They watched the G O P  destroy a Democratic president who expressed a willingness to work with Republicans  hence  they seek a candidate who is more experienced  sophisticated and aggressive In order to beat Trump  Model contends The Democratic standard bearer must carry a significant proportion of two constituencies  African Americans and working class white males  Under an O Rourke candidacy  too many African Americans will stay home and too many working class white males will vote for Trump  Perhaps no Democratic candidate is capable of succeeding simultaneously with these two heterogeneous groups  but that is the most plausible route to a Trump defeat Which brings us back to the existential question I raised at the beginning of this column  Can Beto O Rourke beat Donald Trump O Rourke s fund raising success will keep him in the contest longer than less fortunate competitors  and the volume of media coverage he elicits is boosting his name recognition  a crucial first step G  Elliott Morris  a political data reporter for the Economist  noted on Twitter that O Rourke has received more cable news coverage in the five days since his announcement than any other candidate during the full post announcement week  O Rourke is on a path to get 180 percent of the coverage received by Bernie Sanders  the previous leader on this measure While head to head polls are still in a larval stage  they do signal the demographic sources of support for the candidates The most recent CNN poll  released on Tuesday  shows  for example  that the leader  Joe Biden  at 28 percent overall  gets more support from moderates than from liberals  more from older voters than young voters  more from men than women and more from whites than from minorities  Bernie Sanders  at 20 percent  is just the opposite  stronger among liberals  young voters  minorities and women O Rourke  at 11 percent  has a long way to go to catch up with either Biden or Sanders  But the CNN poll shows that O Rourke s supporters tend to be slightly more liberal than moderate  young rather than old  female rather than male  and O Rourke gets more support from African Americans and Hispanics than from whites  In other words  O Rourke s backing is tilted to constituencies that are not normally associated with a moderate white Democratic politician whose voting record  by party standards  is on the center right If these demographic patterns hold  O Rourke is competing more directly with Sanders  and Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren  than with Biden The Sanders O Rourke battle has already begun  Bernie Sanders loyalists have been challenging O Rourke s credentials for the past three months as both men seek support from younger voters  Forces loyal to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are waging an increasingly public war against Texas Rep  Beto O Rourke  the new darling of Democratic activists   Jonathan Allen and Alex Seitz Wald of NBC News wrote in December   O Rourke s ability to connect with younger and progressive white voters   they continued   puts him in direct competition with the Vermont senator  On Tuesday  Sanders announced that he has hired David Sirota  one of O Rourke s harshest critics  as a senior adviser and speechwriter  On Dec  22  Sirota published a 1 700 word denunciation of O Rourke in The Guardian that concluded Another blank slate Democrat who pretends there is a unifying third way between the 99 percent and the 1 percent and who refuses to take sides in big fights against corporate power   that may excite Betomaniacs  establishment Democrats and those with stakes in the status quo  but it won t rescue our country and it won t save the planet For a candidate with only a modest record in national politics  O Rourke faces a daunting but not necessarily insuperable challenge in securing the nomination  His candidacy will be a test of his charisma and  spark   as Don Fowler put it   of the  decency  and  integrity  that a fair number of voters and observers have commented on   against the more substantial and detailed progressivism of his adversaries  the moderation of still others   and all the things we don t know about him yet The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We

The Business Roundtable  the top lobbying organization for industry in Washington  is often characterized as a nonpartisan or bipartisan organization It represents more than 200 large companies   from oil giants to tech sweethearts   with more than  7 trillion of revenue and more than 15 million workers of all political stripes  But nobody is truly apolitical  and in an age when we increasingly see our business leaders filling the vacuum left by our political leaders  it s important that the public fully understand the views of these unelected leaders So a team of researchers working with the Harvard Law School program on corporate governance set out to find the political inclinations of top executives   not just the 200 who make up the Business Roundtable  but all the executives of the S P 1500  a stock index that covers 90 percent of the United States  market capitalization Rather than look at party affiliation or public statements  the researchers   Alma Cohen  Moshe Hazan  Roberto Tallarita and David Weiss   looked at the truest measure of political leanings  They followed the money For the study  to be released Tuesday  they tracked personal political contributions for more than 3 500 chief executives that occupied the corner office anytime from 2000 to 2017  The period covers a two term Republican presidency  a two term Democratic presidency and the start of President Trump s time in office   after he lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College  In other words  on the whole  voters have been pretty evenly divided between the parties in that time But just 18 4 percent of the executives studied were designated as Democrats  The clear majority   57 7 percent   demonstrated their affiliation through donations to the Republican Party  Indeed  75 percent of donations from the median chief executive were directed to Republicans To be counted a supporter of Republicans or Democrats  executives had to direct at least two thirds of their donations to candidates affiliated with one party  More than a quarter of the executives studied gave enough to both parties to be classified as  neutral   This was the landing spot of Tim Cook  the chief executive of Apple  Despite his public support for Hillary Clinton in the last election and his backing of a number of progressive causes  he frequently gave money to candidates on both sides of the aisle  Unfortunately  the researchers have not disclosed how they classified each executive  saying they wanted to focus on the whole  and not the parts  When I asked for an example  they provided me with Mr  Cook  It is to be expected that leaders of large businesses side with Republicans  given the party s platform of lower taxes and less regulation  But the overwhelming nature of the support for the G O P  is surprising  given the outspoken positions a number of executives have taken in recent years on social issues like climate change  guns and immigration policies The results of this political science experiment has significant implications given how involved the business community has become in creating and influencing laws and public policy   Especially since the Supreme Court s decision in Citizens United  which allowed corporations to make unlimited independent political expenditures  corporate political spending can substantially affect politics and policymaking   the authors of the report wrote The researchers dived deeper into some of the numbers to pull apart political leanings by specific industry  company size  region and even the gender of the executive  Republican chief executives clearly outnumbered Democrats in every industry  but the gap narrowed in the  business equipment  and  telecommunications  sectors  which included technology and internet companies   Nearly half  of business equipment chief executives backed Republicans vs  30 1 percent for Democrats  and 36 9 percent of telecom chiefs supported Republicans vs  22 6 percent for Democrats  Gender differences may be the most surprising  The sample size of women from 2000 to 2017 represented only 2 8 percent of the chief executives  only 1 2 percent in 2000  and 4 4 percent by 2017   but the researchers found that women were nearly evenly split between giving to Republicans  giving to Democrats and giving to both Our political discourse is as divided today as it has been any time since the Civil War  Debates are raging about income inequality  business regulations and capitalism itself   particularly among Democrats but increasingly among some Republicans The opinions held by executives have always resonated beyond their own industries  but their importance is more pronounced today  Mr  Trump  for example  has not hesitated to equate economic policy with foreign policy  It is  then  instructive to understand the political views of our business leaders These executives wield enormous influence over not just policy  but the inclinations of their own employees  One of the most fascinating revelations of the study was that it also looked at the conduct of the businesses themselves  and in the process discovered that disclosures of political donations were highly correlated with the political leaning of its chief executive  Political contributions by public companies do not have to be disclosed to shareholders  although some of companies do it  So the researchers looked instead at the which companies disclosed the donations to shareholders  Using an index developed by the Center for Political Accountability  the professors found that there was  a statistically significant association between having a Republican C E O  and a lower  disclosure score Again  maybe that should be expected  Republicans typically argue against regulations  so the idea of voluntary disclosure might seem anathema to them  But for shareholders of all political leanings who rely on transparency and disclosure  the politics of a chief executive might be a more important factor than expected  Interestingly   having a female C E O  is associated with increased transparency  about political contributions  the researchers found The researchers opted not to conveniently classify executives for us  and perhaps that s for the best  Political views do change over time  and depending on the candidates involved  Mr  Cook  for example  backed Mrs  Clinton and several state Democratic committees before the 2016 election  He also donated to the Republican House speaker  Paul Ryan  It s up to you whether that affects how you vote with your dollars  of course  But now  more than ever  it s worth knowing where the powerful figures in the business world are placing their bets  
WASHINGTON   A panel of federal appeals court judges on Tuesday sharply challenged the legal basis for a lawsuit alleging that President Trump s profits from his luxury Washington hotel violate the Constitution s anti corruption clauses The three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond  Va   appeared much less sympathetic to the lawsuit than the federal district judge in Maryland who has overseen the case thus far  The suit  filed by the attorneys general of Washington  D C   and Maryland  alleges that Mr  Trump s decision to retain ownership of the hotel after he took office violates the Constitution s emoluments clauses During the hearing  Judge Dennis W  Shedd  the panel s senior jurist  suggested the lawsuit seemed to seek to penalize the president for being a successful business executive   You even want him fired from  The Apprentice   don t you   he said  apparently referring to reports that the president benefited from the purchase of rights for the show by government owned foreign broadcasters The lawsuit  the first of its kind  asserts that Mr  Trump is violating the clauses in the Constitution that restrict federal officials from accepting government bestowed financial gains or  emoluments   other than their salaries  The Justice Department asked the appeals court to intervene after a series of rulings against the president by Judge Peter J  Messitte of the United States District Court in Greenbelt  Md Although Judge Messitte limited the case to allegations that Mr  Trump is profiting from foreign  and state government guests who patronize the Trump International Hotel  he has allowed it to proceed to the evidence gathering stage over vigorous objections by the Justice Department Legal experts said the appeals court judges could make several moves in the president s favor  including allowing the department to appeal the whole case on an emergency basis or sending it back to the lower court with instructions to Judge Messitte to reconsider the merits of some of his decisions The attorneys general for Maryland and the District of Columbia have asserted that the Trump hotel is unfairly siphoning off business and damaging competitors in their jurisdictions  Judge Messitte ruled that they had enough legal standing for the suit to go forward But Hashim M  Mooppan  a deputy assistant attorney general representing the federal government  told the appeals court judges that the president was immune from such claims   This case should be over   he said   The president is unique  He added   He is not any old inferior officer like the postmaster general  They can t point to any basis in either case law or history to subject the president of the United States  to such demands The judges suggested that the plaintiffs seemed to have no clear notion of what exactly they wanted Mr  Trump to do  should he be found to have violated the emoluments bans They repeatedly asked Loren AliKhan  the solicitor general for the District of Columbia  whether the local jurisdictions were seeking to force Mr  Trump to sell the hotel  put the asset into a blind trust or simply ban state and foreign government guests at that property  You filed the lawsuit and you don t even know what actual  real world relief you think would satisfy your claim of violation   Judge Shedd said When Ms  AliKhan responded that the lower court would decide the proper remedy  Judge Paul V  Niemeyer scoffed   The district court is going to make this up  The third judge on the panel  A  Marvin Quattlebaum Jr   focused on what constitutes an illegal emolument  Courts have never before addressed that issue The plaintiffs have argued that it should be defined as any government bestowed profit  gain or advantage  other than a salary  But Judge Quattlebaum asked whether that would force Mr  Trump to sell his Treasury bonds  since the interest constituted profit At a news conference after the hearing  the local attorneys general expressed confidence that they would prevail  Despite the rain of harsh questions  Karl A  Racine  the attorney general of the District of Columbia  said   I did not take anything from their tone  
TEL AVIV   Imagine if Joe Biden and Colin Powell announced that they were setting aside partisan politics and forming a new centrist party to save the country from Donald Trump  Then imagine that they were so serious about their goal that they promised to share power  rotating the roles of president and secretary of state Could they win That is the question Israeli voters are asking themselves  Last month  Benny Gantz  a former chief of staff of the army and a political rookie  and Yair Lapid  a former journalist and finance minister  came together to form Blue and White   Mr  Gantz would serve as prime minister first  with Mr  Lapid as foreign minister   The centrist party is named after the colors of the flag  its candidates are an all star lineup of top military brass  and polls so far have put Blue and White neck and neck with Benjamin Netanyahu s ruling Likud  Over a week  I met many voters who say they will cast their ballot on April 9 for the centrists  Why  To a person  the answer boiled down to two words  Not Bibi I met Mr  Lapid on Thursday evening for tea at a North Tel Aviv cafe  When I ran this anyone but Bibi read of the election past him  he shot back that it was  dead wrong  In the hour that followed  Mr  Lapid  who calls himself a barometer of the Israeli center  made his case to me Voters are turning to his party because they are looking for basic morality  he said  While the sitting prime minister faces three charges of corruption  the men of Blue and White  the top eight of the 10 politicians on the list are men  are motivated by  old fashioned  duty calls politics   While Mr  Netanyahu s message is one of division  Blue and White speaks about unity  And while Bibi has forged an alliance with the explicitly anti Arab party Otzma Yehudit  Mr  Lapid said that a  racist  party  cannot be a part of a government in this country   The second difference between the men of Blue and White and Bibi  said Mr  Lapid  is how they see the role of Israel in a world in which democracy is on the decline  While Bibi has aligned himself with right wing populists like Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Viktor Orban of Hungary  Mr  Lapid sees common cause with liberals like France s Emmanuel Macron and Mark Rutte of the Netherlands  He hopes such politicians represent  a comeback of civil  moderate  leaders who understand  the risks and hazards of populism  ImageA billboard in Ramat Gan showing the Blue and White leaders Moshe Yaalon  Benny Gantz  Yair Lapid and Gabi Ashkenazi alongside a billboard showing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flanked by the extreme right politicians Itamar Ben Gvir  Bezalel Smotrich and Michael Ben Ari CreditAck Guez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesChief among those hazards is anti Semitism  Mr  Lapid said he is  very upset  by what he sees happening in Hungary   the country where his father survived the Nazi genocide  Given his concern with Mr  Orban s historical revisionism  the way the autocrat has demonized the Jewish philanthropist George Soros  and his general xenophobia  what does Mr  Lapid make of the fact that Israel s current government has cozied up to the Hungarian leader   A country as small as Israel  facing our magnitude of threats  cannot be that picky about the way other countries decide to govern themselves   he began  But  he added   we also have a moral duty  I pushed forward in the last Knesset a recognition of the Armenian Holocaust even though this is not the right practical move opposite the Turks  Because there is a point where you say enough is enough  He was far more careful when I turned to the subject of Donald Trump   I am  like any other Israeli  thankful for President Trump  I sat at the opening of the Embassy in Jerusalem with tears in my eyes   he said  What of Mr  Trump s recent flurry of statements about how the Democratic Party has become anti Israel and anti Jewish   I m going to say this as politely as I can   Mr  Lapid said   He was wrong  I don t think you can say that Eliot Engel and Jerry Nadler and Ted Deutch and Chuck Schumer don t like Israel  They are the most pro Israel people I know   Mr  Lapid said one of his priorities if he wins would be to rebuild support for Israel among progressives   Israel must be a bipartisan issue   he said One of the casualties of Israel becoming an increasingly partisan issue has been American Jews themselves  who vote overwhelmingly Democratic and who see Israel s rightward turn as betraying fundamental liberal values  In other words  American Jews find themselves stuck between B D S    the boycott movement against Israel   and Bibi   I understand the fact that some kind of gap was opened between Israel and the diaspora   Mr  Lapid said of this problem   I think what unites us   culturally  morally   is way bigger than what separates us  And what we need to go back to is this vocabulary of one people  It is when Mr  Lapid talks about Jewish values and Jewish history that he is the most compelling  Doubly so when it comes to the subject of his father  Tommy Lapid  a Holocaust survivor who built a life in Israel as a journalist and then as a politician  and died in 2008  My father had a friend in the Budapest ghetto  His name was Thomas Lantos   Mr  Lapid said   After the Holocaust  they went to the same pier in the same harbor and Tom took a boat and went left and my dad took a boat and went right   Mr  Lantos eventually ended up in California  where he became a Democratic member of the House of Representatives and head of the Foreign Affairs Committee   They always felt that if they took the opposite boat  Tom would be the minister of justice and my father would be the head of the foreign committee   We are the revolving door   he said  an unusual but beautiful metaphor for Jews  shared sense of history and destiny   I was once a young journalist in this country  I could have been you and you could have been me  We share something that we don t totally have the words for  This is what the anti Semites hate  We have something they don t understand  Ultimately  though  what drives Israeli elections is not fine words about Jewish peoplehood  any more than it is marijuana legalization or tax policy  It is security  Anyone who has paid any attention to the past two decades of headlines   the Second Intifada  Hamas s rise in Gaza  the failed Arab Spring  the Syrian civil war   should understand Israelis  sense of vulnerability in the region  Mr  Netanyahu s long experience reassures many voters who still see Mr  Lapid as a former TV personality lacking in real substance and Mr  Gantz as a political novice Mr  Lapid is aware of this   Security will be the first demand every Israeli in his right mind will talk to you about   he told me  There are several issues in which the majority of Israelis   70 to 80 percent   think approximately the same   he said   We are all students of the disengagement of 2005  in which Israel did what the world asked us to do  We left Gaza  We dismantled the settlements  And I supported it at the time  But you know what  It was a mistake  doing it unilaterally  The only thing that happened is that less than a year later they voted Hamas into power  We left them with 3 000 greenhouses for them to build an economy and instead they built training camps  for jihadis  So where does that leave the West Bank  Can the occupation go on indefinitely He paused   It s a very American question   Because Americans think  everything is fixable    Really  really wanting something or desiring something strongly is just not enough   he said   I m not willing to see one Jew die because someone took an unnecessary risk in the name of values I really cherish  Like peace  like humanity  like people s need for self recognition   We need to have the vision and the courage Menachem Begin had  But we also need to be very patient waiting for an Anwar Sadat on the other side  And there is no Sadat on the other side right now   he says  referring to the Egyptian leader who made peace with Israel in 1979   a cold peace that continues to this day In a way  this hawkish consensus is the story that Americans have missed about Israel  No serious contender for the prime ministership is talking about peace or an imminent two state solution  Indeed  the fact that Mr  Lapid believes Blue and White can form  a unity coalition with post Netanyahu Likud and Labor  shows just how far to the right Israel has shifted Two hours after I left Mr  Lapid  I heard the deep boom of the Iron Dome intercepting rockets over Tel Aviv  Back at the hotel  the receptionist showed me the bomb shelter  just in case  In the morning  I read that Israel had hit 100 targets in Gaza overnight  The Hamas rockets shot at Tel Aviv were a gift  to Bibi  a senior Israeli official  who asked for anonymity  told me the next day   Netanyahu could fire back at a hundred Gazan targets without risking war  Hamas knows just how far it can push him  and he knows how far he can push back  The same cannot be said of Benny Gantz  If Blue and White is elected  he s sure to be tested by Hamas and others  with untold consequences  Mr  Lapid thinks he and Mr  Gantz are more than up to the task   The Holocaust taught us that the only test of moral people is in immoral times   he said   This translates in Israel into daily dilemmas  You re a young officer and someone is shooting at you and your soldiers from inside a hospital  What do you do  Who do you protect  How do you solve this problem  This tension between morality and survival is to me the core of 21st century Judaism   he said   It is true in Pittsburgh  It is true in Tel Aviv  It is true everywhere  And I consider myself the keeper of this dilemma  RelatedOpinion   Ayman OdehNetanyahu Opens the Doors of Power to ExtremistsMarch 8  2019
If you visit the online betting market PredictIt  you ll see a long list of 2020 Democratic candidates  ranked in order of their odds of winning the party s nomination for president  according to the site s users Joe Biden  the former vice president  and Senator Bernie Sanders top the list  Then come other well known Democrats  Senator Kamala Harris  former Representative Beto O Rourke  Andrew Yang  Senator Elizabeth Warren Wait  hang on a minute  Andrew Yang This is not an algorithm glitch  it turns out  Mr  Yang  44  an entrepreneur and a political neophyte running on the idea that the United States should provide a universal basic income  is popping up in unexpected places in the Democratic contest He has catapulted out of obscurity thanks in part to a devoted internet following known as the  Yang Gang   His fans have plastered Mr  Yang into memes and produced songs and music videos about his candidacy  They have also created a hashtaggable slogan    securethebag   out of his signature campaign proposal to give  12 000 a year in no strings attached cash to every American adult  as a cushion against the mass unemployment he believes is coming thanks to artificial intelligence and automation By conventional standards  Mr  Yang remains a fringe candidate  In national polls  his support among Democrats has registered between 0 and 1 percent  But his viral popularity on social media feels reminiscent of the  meme army  that helped lift President Trump to victory in 2016  WikiLeaks  itself a part of the internet s political underbelly  recently took note of Mr  Yang s online momentum  and asked   Did Trump just lose the 2020 meme war   It s very   interesting becoming the internet candidate   Mr  Yang said last week in an interview while he was on his way to a rally in San Francisco   I m getting support from quarters I wouldn t have expected  A lot has changed for Mr  Yang since I profiled him a year ago  At the time  he was best known as a businessman who had sold his test prep company to Kaplan before starting Venture for America  a nonprofit entrepreneurship organization for college graduates  He was entering the race with little name recognition  a nonexistent war chest and a quirky platform centered on his claim of an impending robot apocalypse To ease the pain  he proposed what he called the  Freedom Dividend   a  1 000 a month basic income that would be paid to every American adult  regardless of income or employment status Image I m getting support from quarters I wouldn t have expected   Mr  Yang said CreditGuerin Blask for The New York TimesIn lieu of cable news appearances and huge rallies  Mr  Yang took his fledgling campaign on the podcast circuit  He appeared with Ezra Klein of Vox and Sam Harris  the author and host of the popular  Making Sense  podcast  Last month  he was interviewed for two hours by Joe Rogan  a stand up comedian and mixed martial arts commentator whose podcast reaches an audience of many millions of people After he appeared on Mr  Rogan s show  his campaign experienced an influx of support  and it quickly reached the 65 000 individual donations required by the Democratic National Committee for inclusion in the first televised debates  Since the interview aired  he has raised more than  1 million  I kept waiting for things to subside   he told me   And then it never did  Other candidates have become internet phenomena before  In 2016  Mr  Sanders s campaign first took off on sites like Reddit and Facebook among young progressives who set out to make him internet famous   One such group  Bernie Sanders  Dank Meme Stash  still has more than 400 000 members   And Mr  Trump  who benefited from a surge among young  internet savvy supporters early in his campaign  has been attentive to the internet s rightmost fringes Mr  Yang s campaign feels different  though  in that it reflects the fractured nature of the modern internet  It has attracted economic wonks  tech skeptic progressives  right wing bigots  members of the so called intellectual dark web and an assortment of half serious trolls   At times  watching the Yang Gang at work can feel like the political equivalent of the  Boaty McBoatface  episode   a group of bored internet mischief makers seeing how far they can push a joke   There s a sect of people who congregate online who view politics as almost a pointless exercise   said Neeraj K  Agrawal  a communications director at a cryptocurrency focused nonprofit  when asked to explain Mr  Yang s appeal   I think  in that context  elections and campaigns might as well be hilarious  Some of Mr  Yang s online support has been the kind he would rather not have  His candidacy has become an obsession on the politics forum on 4Chan  a message board known for the virulently racist and sexist views of its users  who call his basic income proposal  YangBux  Several prominent white nationalists  including Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin  the publisher of the neo Nazi website the Daily Stormer  have also signaled their support for Mr  Yang  who they believe shares their concern for the fate of the white race  In a tweet  Mr  Spencer called Mr  Yang  the most grounded presidential candidate of my lifetime   It s uncomfortable   Mr  Yang  a son of immigrants  said of his campaign s being embraced by the internet s far right fringe   They re antithetical to everything I stand for  You can t control the internet  of course  But Mr  Yang may be able to repel some of his most objectionable right wing supporters by emphasizing his progressive policy positions  He has broadened his platform to include issues like marijuana legalization and Puerto Rican statehood  he supports both  as well as more obscure subjects like marketing robocalls and circumcision  he opposes both  VideoWhen we manipulate politicians  images to our own ends  we may feel powerful   but are we He is also playing along eagerly with his tamer online fans  retweeting their memes and egging them on with joke policy proposals like a  canine dividend   which would give every American household 1 000 dogs a month Mr  Yang s rush of online support has earned him the attention of major media outlets  and has led to a series of TV appearances    The ratio of days I have makeup on is getting higher   he recently tweeted   But mainstream Democrats don t seem intimidated yet  We are quick to forget that online support is loudest among die hards and is not representative of voters   said Andrew Bleeker  the president of the Democratic communications firm Bully Pulpit Interactive and a former adviser to President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on digital strategy Still  some people who have noticed Mr  Yang s rise on social media have cited his enthusiastic fan base   and the fact that nobody saw Mr  Trump coming  either   as proof that it s too early to write anyone off  There s a vacuum on the left for people like Yang who view the internet as a primary and not secondary medium for audience building   said Elizabeth Spiers  a Democratic political consultant and a former editor of Gawker But there is a difference between building an online audience and running a successful campaign for president  The challenge he faces is how to take the enthusiasm and energy he s getting on social media and elsewhere and turn it into action   said Kelly Dietrich  the founder of the National Democratic Training Committee  which helps train candidates to run for political office Mr  Yang is not resting on his internet laurels  He has set new a goal of raising 200 000 individual donations by June  and he is planning a series of rallies in Chicago  New York and other cities later in the spring He said he was also exploring the possibility of having a lifelike 3 D hologram made of himself that could be carried around battleground states like Iowa on the back of a flatbed truck  allowing Mr  Yang to give a recorded version of his stump speech without being physically present  It s a way for me to be in two places at once   he said 
BUDAPEST   Fidesz  the party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary  was suspended from the European Union s most powerful political coalition on Wednesday  endangering an alliance that has shielded him from serious repercussions as he has dismantled or co opted nearly every check on his power Over nine years  as Mr  Orban has created in Hungary what amounts to a soft dictatorship within the European Union  lawmakers in Brussels have largely stood by and watched There have been speeches condemning his assault on fundamental human rights and threats of sanctions for undermining the core democratic values of the union  but Mr  Orban has continued to act with the swagger of a made man  confident that he was protected no matter how bold his provocation One reason for that was that Fidesz plays a key role in the European Parliament s largest political grouping  the generally center right European People s Party There had been calls from many within the alliance to expel Mr  Orban and his party  arguing that he was making a mockery of the very political family to which he belongs  However  by not expelling Fidesz  the E P P  can count members of that party elected in European elections in May as part of its parliamentary grouping  and thus reduce the impact of an expected wave of populist  far right candidates ImageA protest in Budapest against measures introduced by Mr  Orban CreditChris Mcgrath Getty ImagesHungarian television featured a constant stream of programming questioning the legitimacy of the debate going on in Brussels  saying it was really about migration policy  Mr  Orban sought to cast the censure as a victory Even though lawmakers voted nearly unanimously to suspend Fidesz  Mr  Orban said that his party had decided to suspend itself  We would like the E P P  to remain the strongest party in Europe   he said after the three hour debate Under the terms of the suspension  Fidesz will not be allowed to nominate candidates for jobs in the grouping or attend party meetings It will also have to submit to a review by a three person monitoring committee   Mr  Orban adopted a droll tone in referring to it as it is commonly known   the council of the wise    that will determine if the Hungarian government is meeting several conditions ImageOn billboards  Mr  Orban has accused Jean Claude Juncker  president of the European Union s executive arm  of pushing migration plans encouraged by George Soros CreditBernadett Szabo ReutersThose conditions include ceasing its attacks on academic freedom  The committee will be led by a former European Council president  Herman Van Rompuy The confrontation in Brussels was the culmination of more than a year of escalating tensions between Mr  Orban and the coalition  which also faces high stakes  Losing Fidesz s legislators   currently  there are 12   could cost the group its primacy in the European Parliament after May s elections  And other parties could follow Mr  Orban out the door  Since Fidesz got re elected  the Hungarian government has been acting as if it was literally crying for expulsion   said Edit Zgut  a political scientist at the University of Warsaw s Center for Europe In recent months  she said  the Hungarian government had stepped up attacks on academic freedom  criminalized humanitarian aid for refugees and migrants  and continued to undermine the independence of the judiciary Wednesday s coalition vote  she said  was a strategy to delay any hard choices and fit into a broader pattern of accommodation ImageThe library at the Central European University in Budapest  Mr  Orban has kept up an assault on the widely esteemed university  which was founded by Mr  Soros after the fall of the Soviet Union CreditChris Mcgrath Getty ImagesAt the height of Mr  Orban s anti democratic measures  between 2010 and 2015  he rarely faced significant censure within the European People s Party  since his peers did not judge him a threat to European integration  and believed that they still had a moderating effect on the worst of his domestic policies In more recent years  however  opinion has slowly shifted  Mr  Orban has relished attacking the European Union  even while enjoying the benefits that come with membership  including billions in funding that play a key role in the health of Hungary s economy  He made clear that he no longer felt constrained by his European coalition colleagues   and even began to criticize them In September  the European Parliament passed a resolution that raised concerns about the fairness of the courts  the independence of the news media and the freedom of academic institutions in Hungary  Dozens of European People s Party lawmakers joined in the vote  but the grouping refused to expel him  At its annual conference in Helsinki in September  the grouping s president  Joseph Daul  referred to Mr  Orban as the enfant terrible of the family  but a family member even so In response to the September vote  Mr  Orban launched a domestic media blitz  accusing critics of his government of being part of a nefarious cabal bent on destroying Hungarian culture and sending hordes of migrants to the country He also kept up his assault on the widely esteemed Central European University  which was founded by the American billionaire George Soros after the fall of the Soviet Union ImagePolice officers patrolling Hungary s border with Serbia  Anti migrant policies have been a central platform of Mr  Orban s government CreditChris Mcgrath Getty ImagesMr  Soros  who was born in Hungary  has long been used by Mr  Orban as an all purpose villain  a symbol of sinister foreign forces that threaten the nation  His government s relentless campaign against Mr  Soros has been widely condemned for both outright lies and for anti Semitism In December  the university announced that after two years of battling to stay in Hungary  it was being forced to move some of its operations to Vienna Once again  Mr  Orban s actions were met with widespread condemnation  But Mr  Orban seemed emboldened In February  his government launched yet another assault on Brussels  using taxpayer funds to plaster tens of thousands of posters around the country warning that European lawmakers wanted to inundate the country with migrants This time  however  instead of merely condemning faceless officials  the Orban government put the face of Jean Claude Juncker  the president of the European Union s executive arm and a fellow member of the European People s Party  alongside that of Mr  Soros ImageA man selling Hungarian and European Union flags during a demonstration against Mr  Orban s government in Budapest CreditChris Mcgrath Getty Images You have the right to know what Brussels is planning to do   the posters warned darkly Mr  Orban has a bad history with Mr  Juncker  including an episode in 2014 when Mr  Juncker greeted Mr  Orban with an awkward joke  saying   Hello  dictator   and playfully tapping his face But the Orban government s direct attack on Mr  Juncker seemed a bridge too far  The propaganda campaign was denounced as a shocking promotion of a ludicrous conspiracy theory Mr  Orban dismissed his critics inside the E P P   calling them  useful idiots  It is a phrase freighted with historical resonance  sometimes attributed to Lenin  as his assessment of the naïve Western admirers of his brand of socialism Manfred Weber  who leads the European People s Party in the European Parliament and is running to succeed Mr  Juncker as the leader of the European Commission  rushed to Budapest  demanding an apology Mr  Orban conceded only that he was sorry if anyone was offended  Even after the suspension  Mr  Orban denied that he had waged a campaign against Mr  Juncker  saying his government was simply informing the Hungarian people Mr  Weber also demanded that the Central European University be allowed to once again operate in Budapest  Mr  Orban has been noncommittal  but his government signaled that he was ready to make some concessions Given the stakes  the powerful German Christian Democrats tried to straddle the fence with support for suspension   As long as Fidesz does not fully restore trust  there cannot be normal full membership   Annegret Kramp Karrenbauer  the leader of the party and a confidante of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany  told Reuters earlier on Wednesday Jörg Meuthen  a spokesman for the far right Alternative for Germany party  said that Mr  Orban and Fidesz had their real home with the far right in the European Parliament  With its clear and future oriented positions  especially in central questions like migration and border control  Orban and Fidesz would fit much better into the family of parties in Europe that truly stands for conservatism and freedom   Mr  Meuthen said 
WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Tuesday that he was  never a fan  of the late Senator John McCain   and I never will be  The president s blunt remarks came in response to a reporter s question about his recent attacks on the Republican war hero who represented Arizona  and who died last year of brain cancer On Tuesday  the focus of Mr  Trump s ire was Mr  McCain s historic vote on health care in 2017  when he went against his own party and opposed a Republican measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act  He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years  and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down   Mr  Trump said on Tuesday after taking reporters  questions alongside the president of Brazil  who was at the White House for an official visit   Our country would have saved a trillion dollars and we would have had great health care  Over the weekend  however  Mr  Trump s attacks on Mr  McCain largely focused on the Russia investigation  Mr  Trump derided Mr  McCain  the Republican nominee for president in 2008  for sharing with the F B I  a copy of a salacious and uncorroborated dossier on the Trump campaign s dealings with Russia  though Mr  Trump falsely claimed Mr  McCain had shared it with the agency before the election  Mr  Trump also falsely said Mr  McCain was last in his class at the Naval Academy  In fact  Mr  McCain was fifth from the bottom and often mocked himself for it Mr  McCain s daughter  Meghan McCain  hit back at Mr  Trump on Saturday and said in a Twitter post   No one will ever love you the way they loved my father

WASHINGTON   President Trump hosted Jair Bolsonaro  the Brazilian president  at the White House on Tuesday  and it was something like looking in the mirror Like other authoritarian leaders Mr  Trump has embraced since taking office  Mr  Bolsonaro is an echo of the American president  a brash nationalist whose populist appeal comes partly from his use of Twitter and his history of making crude statements about women  gay people and indigenous groups  They say he s the Donald Trump of South America   Mr  Trump marveled during a speech to the Farm Bureau in January  noting that Mr  Bolsonaro had been called the  Trump of the tropics  since taking office this year   Do you believe that  And he s happy with that  If he wasn t  I wouldn t like the country so much  But I like him  At a news conference after the two men held a luncheon meeting  Mr  Trump gushed that  I think Brazil s relationship with the United States  because of our friendship  is probably better than it s ever been by far   Our trade with Brazil will go substantially up   Mr  Trump predicted earlier in the afternoon   and that s one of the things Brazil would like to see  United States officials said this week that Mr  Trump appreciated the way Mr  Bolsonaro powered his way to victory in Brazil s election by being unabashedly pro American and declaring repeatedly that he wanted to have a close relationship with Mr  Trump In part because of the stylistic similarities between the two leaders  White House officials expressed optimism that Brazil and the United States   two of the largest economies in the Western Hemisphere   would be able to work through disagreements and forge a closer bond on trade and regional issues in South America  including confronting the political crisis in Venezuela But the warmth displayed between the two leaders at the White House also underscores how Mr  Trump has upended the usual foreign policy traditions established over decades by his predecessors Since taking office  Mr  Trump has repeatedly confronted and challenged the United States  closest democratic allies  including the leaders of Canada  Germany and France  while speaking with glowing admiration about some of the globe s most brutal dictators  Kim Jong un of North Korea  Vladimir V  Putin of Russia  Xi Jinping of China  Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt  Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines Image Trump of the Tropics   How Brazil s President Came to PowerJair Bolsonaro spent most of his career on the political fringe  until his message started to resonate with

by Michael Barbaro  produced by Alexandra Leigh Young  Andy Mills and Jonathan Wolfe  and edited by Paige Cowett and Lisa TobinJair Bolsonaro spent most of his career on the political fringe  until his message started to resonate with a country reeling from economic hardship and a widespread corruption scandal michael barbaroFrom the New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  archived recording  donald trump Today  I m very thrilled to welcome President Bolsonaro of Brazil for his first visit to the White House michael barbaroOn Tuesday  President Trump held a joint news conference with the newly elected president of Brazil  Jair Bolsonaro archived recording  donald trump President Bolsonaro  I want to congratulate you again on your tremendous election victory  Last October  it was an incredible feat and  really  a truly incredible challenge  And the end result was something the whole world was talking about michael barbaroThe campaign he ran and his brash style have earned Bolsonaro the nickname the  Trump of the tropics   a comparison that Trump has embraced and said he is honored by archived recording  donald trump I also know that we re going to have a fantastic working relationship  We have many views that are similar michael barbaroMy colleague  Ernesto Londoño  on the story of Bolsonaro  It s Wednesday  March 20  So who is Bolsonaro  and how did he enter Brazilian politics ernesto londoñoBolsonaro is a former army captain  He was a paratrooper who had a pretty short and fairly turbulent stint in the military  He actually got kicked out  But after leaving the military in not the best of terms  he was very successful at sliding into a political career  initially as a city council member in his native Rio de Janeiro  And then very soon  he found his way to the capital  Brasília  as a congressman archived recordingThe dictatorship was at its most harsh in the late  60s and early  70s ernesto londoñoAnd the country was emerging from a pretty traumatic period archived recordingStudent demonstrations in 1968  calling for the restoration of democratic rights  prompted a strong response from the military ernesto londoñoIt was definitely an era of repression  of terror  for many groups that were at odds with the military government  and a pretty widespread censorship and curtailment of civil rights archived recordingMany of those arrested were to face torture ernesto londoñoBut in  88  lawmakers passed a very progressive Constitution archived recordingIt s 29 years since Brazil last held free presidential elections ernesto londoñoIf there is one point where it became starkly clear that Brazil had reached cruising altitude as a democracy  it would ve been the election of Luiz Inácio da Silva  commonly known as Lula  in 2002  Lula was a former shoeshiner  son of a single mother  raised poor  rose to prominence as a union leader  started building a political movement during the era of military rule and was briefly jailed as a political prisoner  And when he is sworn in 2003  archived recording PORTUGUESE SPEECH ernesto londoño  the region really sort of took a look at Brazil and said  wow  this country has really turned a corner  If a man like Lula can get elected in Brazil  Brazil has really matured as a democracy michael barbaroAnd what role does Bolsonaro play in the midst of this pretty dramatic shift in Brazil ernesto londoñoBolsonaro was seen as kind of a loud and obnoxious lawmaker  who would just get into these shouting matches in Congress  would deliver these fiery speeches archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoHe became infamous for saying things that were very offensive about women archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoAbout blacks archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoAbout gays archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoHe made the news  for instance  when he got into a shouting match with a female lawmaker archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoAnd told her that she was too ugly to rape archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoAnd the most startling thing  and it was the theme he went back and back to  was his praise for the era of military rule archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoThat Brazil needed strong men at the helm and that this experiment with democracy was not taking the country in the right direction michael barbaroSo just as kind of modern democratic Brazil is coming into form  it sounds like Bolsonaro is entering politics  but is pushing in the other direction  for less democracy  more authoritarianism ernesto londoñoAbsolutely  He essentially made the case  only the military can run this large  unwieldy country effectively  And we re wasting our time thinking that this experiment with democracy is going to take us anywhere productive michael barbaroAnd what was the response to moments like that ernesto londoñoLargely speaking  people started saying  well  that s just Bolsonaro being Bolsonaro  He made headlines  He was admonished  He was criticized  But he was not somebody who was really taken seriously  He was not somebody who was center stage when big deals were being negotiated  For most of his career  he was a little bit of a sideshow  And at the same time  archived recordingIn Brazil  Petrobras recently made what could be the world s biggest oil discovery since the 1970s ernesto londoñoLula had a remarkably successful first term as president  and Brazilians started seeing some pretty sweeping changes  Brazil  like much of the region  was enjoying a commodities boom archived recordingThe discovery could mean that Brazil will become one of the world s leading oil exporters ernesto londoñoThere were some pretty groundbreaking policies that paved the way for people from poor families  people from rural communities  for the first time to go to university archived recordingIn just seven years  almost 30 million Brazilians have joined the ranks of the middle class  some helped by government handouts  others through improved education  which leads to higher wages ernesto londoñoThere was a sense that inequality was diminishing in a country where it s long been really hard to move up the ladder  And Brazil started aspiring to great things  Brazil started making alliances with other large economies  like Russia and China and South Africa  and kind of projecting itself on the world stage as a rising power  I think this all became crystal clear  just kind of a sense of optimism and the sense that Brazil seemed unstoppable  when  archived recordingI have the honor to announce that the Games of the 31st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro   CROWD CHEERS ernesto londoñoIn 2009  Brazil beat the odds and won the rights to host the 2016 Olympic Games  And  you know  looking back now at how optimistic  you know  the scenes of people partying on the beach in Copacabana  just celebrating this major triumph for Brazil  it seems impossible to think now that the seeds of what would happen next had already been planted  And the reality was that underneath this triumphant country that seemed to be rising into a bright new era  underneath all that  there was a lot of rot  And it would take a few years for people here to discover just how much  music michael barbaroSo  Ernesto  how did this rot that you describe  this ugliness beneath the surface  eventually get exposed ernesto londoñoWell  things in Brazil started taking a definite turn for the worse in 2014  Two major things happened  On the one hand  the economy  which had been on a slide  entered into recession  On the other hand  a team of investigators stumbled into a major scandal while they were looking at some funny financial transactions  initially at a gas station archived recording 1In the past week  Brazilians have had wall to wall coverage of a political scandal threatening to bring down the country s government  It first came to light when Brazilian police uncovered a money laundering operation at a car wash archived recording 2It s known as Operation Car Wash ernesto londoñoThat quickly reached very  very deeply into very powerful politicians and the top companies in Brazil archived recording 1The investigation centers on a billion dollar corruption scandal at Brazil s mammoth oil corporation  Petrobras archived recording 2Petrobras is one of Brazil s biggest companies  It s alleged senior officials took almost  700 million in bribes when awarding construction contracts  Many that may have taken bribes are linked to the government ernesto londoñoWe re talking about massive companies that had entire departments with the task of paying bribes to politicians archived recording 1The speaker of Brazil s lower house of Congress has been charged over alleged involvement in a corruption scandal at the state run  archived recording 2News breaking in the last hour that the former president of Brazil is being detained by police after a raid on his home and office  ernesto londoñoIt soon became apparent to Brazilians that corruption had been institutionalized archived recordingFive former Brazilian presidents  nearly one out of three cabinet ministers  and almost one out of three senators have been indicted or investigated michael barbaroAnd what was the reaction in the general Brazilian public once all this corruption comes to light ernesto londoñoThere was outrage archived recording CHANTING ernesto londoñoAs these scandals started engulfing some of the pillars of the economy here  some of the biggest companies in the country  unemployment goes up  people s purchasing power goes down  and state governments start going bankrupt archived recording CHANTING ernesto londoñoIn some places  this means the police aren t getting paid  And people start seeing a surge of violence archived recordingWith more than 50 000 violent deaths every year  Brazil has one of the world s highest homicide rates ernesto londoñoThey go from a period of feeling optimistic and almost euphoric about the future to a period of despair and anguish michael barbaroAnd where is Bolsonaro in all of this ernesto londoñoBolsonaro is one of the rarer veteran lawmakers who has not really been splattered by these corruption investigations  And at this time  he starts getting a fair amount of traction  All of a sudden  this guy who had kind of been a fringe character comes more into sync with how Brazilians were feeling about their lot in life archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoAround 2016  he starts telling people that he wants to take a shot at the presidency archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoAnd the way he spread his message was unique in the history of Brazilian presidential races  He was campaigning largely by sitting in front of a phone  which was often shaky archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoAnd just broadcasting videos live on Facebook  on Instagram archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoWhere he was speaking to people as though they were long lost friends archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoIt was completely unscripted  oftentimes stream of consciousness  He would jump from one subject to another archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoAnd I think people saw that as pretty refreshing  People were so disgusted with politics as usual in the political establishment that they saw in this guy  who had been in the fringes for so long  somebody who could radically reinvent the system archived recording CHANTING michael barbaroAnd does he have the stature at this moment to do that ernesto londoñoWhen the very first rumblings of a Bolsonaro presidential bid start coming up  people laughed it off  The conventional wisdom was he s too extreme  He s too outside of the norm  But despite the skepticism  by the end of 2017  it became pretty clear that Bolsonaro s message had strong appeal across the country archived recording CHANTING michael barbaroAnd what exactly is he promising on the campaign trail that the Brazilian people are finding so compelling ernesto londoñoOn corruption  he was very clear in stating that he was going have no patience for business as usual  And that under his tenure  archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoPeople who were corrupt had tons to fear  But I think the main promise he made to his supporters was that he was going to take extraordinary measures to restore security  And we re talking about pretty draconian things  Bolsonaro  for example  once said   A good criminal is a dead criminal  archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoHe made it clear he was essentially going to give the police free rein to shoot suspected criminals on the spot archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoThe third thing he did  which was unusual  was surround himself with military leaders and make them kind of a core base of support  The military had been largely out of sight in politics in Brazil for the past three decades  So this was a pretty bold move  but actually one that captured people s imagination as they longed for a system that was more orderly and more secure michael barbaroSo this cranky  often outrageous character is starting to connect with people ernesto londoñoAbsolutely archived recording CHANTING ernesto londoñoHowever  I think it s important to note that there were a couple of pretty crucial turning points that turbocharged his presidential bid archived recordingBrazil s former president  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  is to stand trial for allegedly accepting over  1 million in bribes ernesto londoñoEarly last year  former president Lula  who had been the front runner according to opinion polls  and who was trying to make a bid for a third term in the presidential palace  got jailed  And after he gets jailed on corruption and money laundering charges  he essentially becomes disqualified  and his party is in disarray  And then you fast forward a few months  and in September of last year  there s a very dramatic moment when  on the campaign trail  Bolsonaro is marching through the streets of a small town  surrounded by supporters  And a man lunges toward him with a big kitchen knife and stabs him in the stomach archived recording SIRENS  Jair Bolsonaro has been left in a serious but stable condition in hospital  this after being stabbed while drumming up support ahead of next month s vote  Hospital officials say it could take two months for him to recover ernesto londoñoHe was essentially knocked off the campaign trail for the remainder of the race  He was in a hospital bed  and then he was in his apartment  and communicating virtually only through social media archived recording  jair bolsonaro  SPEAKING PORTUGUESE ernesto londoñoPeople  I think  saw in this moment the kind of violence that he was railing against in a really crystallized form  This incident that could have easily ended his life ended up propelling his bid archived recording CHANTING  The breaking news is the far right candidate Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil s presidential race ernesto londoñoAnd after this happens  in October  he has a decisive victory michael barbaroAnd what is the reaction across Brazil to this victory ernesto londoñoBrazil emerges from the election pretty polarized  Somebody who had been a very  very long shot for the presidency was able to not just win  but win decisively  However  you also have many communities in the country that feel extraordinarily unsafe in this new Brazil and that worry that the country under Bolsonaro s watch could well transition into a new era of authoritarian rule michael barbaroI wonder what Bolsonaro s election means for Brazil  which  as you told us earlier  is just 30 years from having been a military dictatorship and turned to democracy and seems to have had a pretty rocky journey ernesto londoñoI think it illustrates that many people  not just in Brazil but across Latin America  have become very cynical about democracy  at least the version of democracy they were seeing  Many Brazilians felt that they were being governed by thieves  who just kept getting elected by playing the old political playbook  And I think  in the specific case of Bolsonaro  who comes with a history of having championed authoritarian rule  of wanting to govern very closely with senior military leaders  the promise of order  even if it came at the price of a rollback of civil liberties and of democracy  it was a price many Brazilians were perfectly willing to pay michael barbaroSo to change this system that seems to not be working  it feels like Brazilians want to shock the system and perhaps test its limits  which sounds a little bit like what s going on in the United States ernesto londoñoAbsolutely  When I talked to people on the campaign trail  you know  I was really startled by the level of anguish that they expressed and their willingness to take big risks on a leader who was untested and who comes with all these question marks michael barbaroErnesto  thank you very much ernesto londoñoThank you michael barbaroJust weeks after his swearing in  when Bolsonaro vowed to  quote   rid Brazil of corruption   he faced charges that his own administration was engaging in more of the same  Brazilian prosecutors are investigating the mysterious movement of more than  300 000 in and out of bank accounts controlled by the driver of Bolsonaro s oldest son  a state lawmaker  and why some of those payments went to Bolsonaro s wife  At the same time  Bolsonaro has appointed three government ministers who were previously implicated in investigations of corruption Mr  Bolsonaro has long been an apologist for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades  but he was elected by an ample margin and Brazil is now very much a democracy A former army captain who served for decades in the Brazilian congress  Mr  Bolsonaro vaulted onto the international scene by winning his country s elections last year  He made his first international appearance as president when he attended the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  in January At the White House on Tuesday  Mr  Bolsonaro pledged that the United States and Brazil would  stand side by side in their efforts to ensure liberties and respect to traditional family lifestyles  respect to God our creator against the gender ideology or the politically correct attitudes  and against fake news  A few minutes later  Mr  Trump said he was  very proud to hear the president use the term  fake news   In an interview on Fox News on Monday night  Mr  Bolsonaro lashed out at the news media   much the way Mr  Trump often does   for what he said were inaccurate representations of his past statements about race and women  including having said at one point that  yes  I am homophobic   and very proud of it   If it were all that  I would not at all have been elected president   Mr  Bolsonaro told Shannon Bream of Fox   So there s a great deal of fake news certainly around   the Brazilian population has after all learned how to use social media  And they no longer trust or believe the Brazilian mainstream media  which is virtually dominated by the left wing  Mr  Bolsonaro insisted that  I have nothing against homosexuals or women   I m not a xenophobe  With Mr  Bolsonaro by his side at the White House  Mr  Trump lashed out at social media companies like Twitter and Facebook  accusing them of being  collusive  with his critics and discriminating against conservatives and Republicans  Reacting to a lawsuit filed against social media companies by Representative Devin Nunes  a California Republican and one of his supporters  Mr  Trump hinted that he was prepared to take action against what he called  unfair  practices by the companies  Well  we have to do something  I tell you   Mr  Trump said  If they re in a certain group  there s discrimination and big discrimination   he said   I see it absolutely on Twitter and Facebook   Mr  Trump also criticized television networks   The incredible thing is that we can win an election and we have such a stacked deck  and that includes networks  Mr  Trump and Mr  Bolsonaro said they discussed the future of Venezuela  and Mr  Trump praised his counterpart for Brazil s humanitarian aid to Venezuela and support for Juan Guaidó  the self declared interim president Responding to a question about why sanctions by the United States have so far failed to force Nicolás Maduro  the Venezuela s socialist leader  to surrender his grip on the presidency  Mr  Trump said that the United States had still not imposed the toughest sanctions possible  We really haven t done the really tough sanctions yet   Mr  Trump said   We can do the tough sanctions  and all options are open  We can go a lot tougher if we need to do that  Earlier in the day  the Treasury Department imposed a new round of sanctions against Minerven  Venezuela s state owned gold mining company and its president  Adrian Antonio Perdomo Mata  as part of its effort to increase pressure to the Maduro government  It accused Minerven of propping up Mr  Maduro through  illicit gold operations   including paying independent miners for gold with  nearly worthless bolívars  to sustain the military  The illegitimate Maduro regime is pillaging the wealth of Venezuela while imperiling indigenous people by encroaching on protected areas and causing deforestation and habitat loss   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Appearing with Mr  Bolsonaro in the Oval Office before their meeting  Mr  Trump said that he knew  exactly  what he wanted to happen in Venezuela  but he declined to say what that was  He said that all options were on the table  including the use of the military Asked about the possibility of joining the United States in a potential military action against Venezuela  Mr  Bolsonaro declined to answer  saying that  these reserved issues  which may be discussed  if they have not yet  will not become public  Mr  Bolsonaro s visit to Washington received mixed reviews at home  where many Brazilians were outraged to hear him praise the Trump administration s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and say a majority of immigrants who head to the United States do not have  good intentions  The satire website Sensacionalista mocked Mr  Bolsonaro for concessions announced during the trip  waiving the visa requirement for United States citizens visiting Brazil and agreeing to allow companies from the United States to launch commercial satellites from a base near the Equator  In exchange for the use of our base and the visa exemption for Americans  the president will come home with a Trump baseball cap   the article said  It s actually an incredible location when you study it  and when you see it   Mr  Trump said on Tuesday  referring to the agreement Mr  Bolsonaro had announced allowing United States companies to launch satellites from a base in Alcantara  along the north coast of Brazil   We won t go into it now  but because of the location  tremendous amounts of money would be saved  To put it very simply  the flights are a lot shorter  Brazil experts in the United States said the visit had gone well and would most likely establish a foundation for closer cooperation between the two largest economies in the Americas  We can point to the removal of visa restrictions by Brazil on U S  citizens as a signal that Brazil is working to reduce barriers to engagement   said Roberta Braga  an associate director at the Atlantic Council s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center

SEATTLE   Howard Schultz faced a full court press of troubles as 2006 began  That the Seattle SuperSonics were lousy  having their worst season in 20 years  was only the beginning Though the Sonics were a storied N B A  franchise  with a league championship in 1979  attendance was down at their Seattle arena along with points scored and revenues earned  As the team s lead owner  Mr  Schultz was facing unrest from fans and partners alike  At the same time  Starbucks  the coffee company he had built into a global giant  was about to hit a bad patch  too  as the first ripples of the Great Recession began to rise into a flood tide You don t have to be a basketball fan to know which problem Mr  Schultz was able to fix The Sonics no longer exist   sold by Mr  Schultz s group that same pivotal year  and later moved to Oklahoma City and renamed  even the memorabilia packed away  Now  as Mr  Schultz mulls running for president as an independent candidate  his path through that moment says a lot about him   how he handles adversity and uncertainty  and how he grasped or did not the nettle of local politics as the Sonics were flailing  according to more than 20 people who have observed him  befriended him or worked with or against him over the years His basketball legacy has left many in Seattle outraged to this day  believing Mr  Schultz to be either duplicitous or duped by others  Yet his actions at Starbucks   including a raft of innovations introduced before and during the recession  like health insurance for baristas   became the stuff of adoring Harvard Business School case studies  In Fortune magazine s ranking  Starbucks is the fifth most admired company in the world The common thread   deeply familiar to people in the city Mr  Schultz has called home since the early 1980s  and now echoed in his talk of entering politics   is a kind of idealistic righteousness  combined with obvious conviction about his own abilities and insights  All of which worked like a magic wand in Seattle  except when it didn t ImageMr  Schultz  left  speaking in 2006 about the sale of his basketball team  the Seattle SuperSonics  The franchise moved to Oklahoma City under a new name CreditTed S  Warren Associated Press There s no question that he built an amazing business  one that Seattle has benefited from and one that has worldwide reach   said Greg Nickels  a Democrat who was in his second term as Seattle s mayor in 2006  The Sonics episode  I think  was different   Mr  Nickels added   I think he got into it and discovered it was not what he thought it was going to be  Mr  Schultz  65  a self made billionaire who grew up in public housing in Brooklyn  said in an interview   conducted  at his request  in a Starbucks   that he had not decided whether to seek the White House and had set no deadline for doing so  A self described  lifelong Democrat   Mr  Schultz said that he thought the Democrats were veering too far left  President Trump and the Republicans too far right  and that there was a hunger for a more centrist candidacy like the one he might put up But he also said  as he had repeatedly in recent speeches around the nation promoting a new memoir  that he would not run if he became convinced his candidacy could aid in Mr  Trump s re election Indeed  his announcement in January that he was  seriously  considering running brought an outcry from many Democrats who feared a split vote  The president chimed in  tweeting that Mr  Schultz  who had never sought public office   doesn t have the  guts    and Warren Buffett called a Schultz candidacy  a mistake  As a rule in American politics  independents fail to get elected  Since the Civil War  only four minor party candidates for president have mustered at least 10 percent of the vote  Ross Perot  George Wallace  Robert La Follette and Theodore Roosevelt  Roosevelt  a Republican turned Bull Moose candidate in the 1912 election  couldn t win despite having been a popular president only a few years earlier  But even getting less than 10 percent can make a difference  as Ralph Nader showed in the 2000 election  which put George W  Bush in the White House through an Electoral College victory even though Al Gore  the outgoing vice president  won the popular vote ImageA visit last month to Purdue University in Indiana  He has said that he would consider launching a centrist campaign  though not if it would aid in re electing President Trump CreditJoshua Lott Getty ImagesFor his part  Mr  Schultz believes that an independent president could have a powerful mandate in governing  as a refutation by voters of the bitter and divisive  politics of revenge  that have paralyzed Washington  The example that it could be done would  in turn  draw out a surge of like minded independent candidates who would reshape Congress  he added  The current trajectory we re on demonstrates such evidence of a broken system   Mr  Schultz said   I m looking at the situation and realizing that a large majority of Americans agree with me  If Mr  Schultz does run  his Seattle experience  combined with a back story of self made success  would be the narrative he tells and sells  Starbucks started here  and is a different company  Mr  Schultz said  because of the culture that defines the Pacific Northwest  The Sonics failed here and were a Seattle story  too  for which Mr  Schultz has apologized  In his universe  it s a venti size place of success and failure A Civic UndertakingWhen Mr  Schultz organized an investor group to buy the SuperSonics in 2001  he took the high road of rhetoric  Sounding like a civic patron out only for the city he loved   with the grubby business of moneymaking very much an afterthought   he promised to treat the team as a kind of sacred civic trust  This ownership group did not get involved to make a profit   he said at one point in testifying before Washington State Legislature   We wanted passionate people  about not only sports  but passionate people about our community  That language and imagery came back to haunt him in the aftermath of the team s demise  Schultz became a pariah   said Gary Washburn  a former Seattle sportswriter who now covers the N B A  for The Boston Globe ImageMr  Schultz sold the SuperSonics after not getting the public money he requested to renovate the team s arena  He has called his decision one of his life s biggest regrets CreditTed S  Warren Associated PressIn February 2006  Mr  Schultz drove to the State Capitol in Olympia  plunked down in front a microphone in a wood paneled Senate meeting room and repeated what some considered a threat   that he might have to sell the Sonics if he didn t get more than  200 million in public money for renovations to their arena He said the Sonics were losing money because they had a terrible  uncompetitive arena lacking in the profitable add ons that other franchises had  like restaurants and stores  Public money had been lavished on other sports in Seattle in past years  he pointed out   with new play spaces for the Mariners  a baseball team  and the Seahawks  a football team  It was time to bestow some love on the N B A   Mr  Schultz said It did not go well  The Sonics bailout bill did not even come up for a final vote  The political appeal of financing athletic venues had faded after the 2000 dot com economic bust  and a ballot measure aimed at reducing taxpayer money in professional sports was gaining favor even as Mr  Schultz testified  Initiative 91  as it was called  was approved that fall by a 74 percent majority Several people who were in the Legislature at the time said that Mr  Schultz  who had never been very involved in politics or lobbying  was treated like the outsider he was  and never appeared to understand the network of informal alliances that stood in his way  Calls were coming to legislative offices from people connected to the city s other sports teams  saying they didn t much like the idea of financing a lot of expensive new skybox seats  The Mariners and Seahawks people were not terribly encouraging   they had several back channels  and sort of front channels of stuff going on   said James McIntire  a Democratic state representative at the time who later served two terms as state treasurer Art Thiel  a longtime columnist and sportswriter who covered the Sonics story  said Mr  Schultz simply didn t understand the state capital   He thought that he could do as a pro sports owner the same sorts of things that he could do as a successful business owner  which is either to charm the opposition or bully them   he said   He got neither done  ImageMr  Schultz speaking at a Starbucks shareholders meeting in 2016  He joined the company in the 1980s  transforming

announcing that he and his co owners had sold the team to a group based in Oklahoma  which moved it and renamed it the Thunder Mr  Schultz now calls that decision one of the major regrets of his life  My biggest mistake still reverberates   Mr  Schultz wrote in a recent op ed piece in The Seattle Times  In his book  he elaborates on what happened   Almost everyone blamed me  and after some initial denial  I realized they were right to do so  I had squandered the very public trust that I had bought into  A longtime friend of Mr  Schultz s  Howard Behar  a former vice president at Starbucks  said that while Mr  Schultz learned from the experience  he had been warned in advance that straying from the world he knew might be dangerous  When he bought that company  I had a quote in the local newspaper in Seattle  I said   No good will come from this   I think he s nuts    Mr  Behar recalled   And I was right  No good came from it  Citizen of SeattleThe storied names of the Seattle business world roll off the tongue all over the world  Amazon  Boeing  Eddie Bauer  Microsoft  REI  Starbucks  And just as Microsoft is associated with its co founders  Bill Gates and Paul Allen  and Amazon with its founder  Jeff Bezos  Mr  Schultz is Mr  Coffee  father of the Frappuccino and coffee sizes in butchered Italian   The  venti   for extra large  which just means  20  in Italian  is a nod to the espresso culture Mr  Schultz fell in love with on a trip to Italy in 1983  Mr  Schultz  who handed off leadership reins at the company last year  came to Seattle with his wife  Sheri  in 1982  to take a job as marketing director of Starbucks  then just a modest local seller of coffee beans  Only five years later he organized an investor group to buy the company  and then built it   with two stints as chief executive   into a retail giant with nearly 30 000 stores around the world and more than 380 000 employees ImageProtesters in January as Mr  Schultz promoted a new memoir CreditJason Redmond ReutersBut like Seattle itself  with its vast wealth and abundant homelessness  its left leaning social and environmental policies but no income tax on its considerable allotment of billionaires  the Schultz legacy is mixed At his first Seattle appearance after announcing his presidential considerations  protesters gathered outside a downtown theater where he was promoting his new memoir  The protesters waved signs about  venti egos  and failed billionaire politicians  while the audience inside cheered at almost every whispered hint of a presidential run In charitable civic work  the Schultz Family Foundation has been a force in homeless advocacy  working with shelter groups and youth training centers in Seattle  with a data driven approach to moving homeless families off the street quickly and into stable housing  The foundation piloted something and proved that it worked   said Marty Hartman  the executive director at Mary s Place  a nonprofit shelter provider that has received more than  4 5 million from Starbucks and the Schultz foundation But by other measures of civic engagement  like bothering to vote  Mr  Schultz has been less involved  Of 40 elections held since 2003 that he could have participated in as a Seattle resident  he voted only 12 times  according to King County records  I m remiss  of course  that I did not vote in those local elections  but you know I travel so much   Mr  Schultz said in the interview   though he quickly added that he had never missed a chance to vote for president 
WASHINGTON   The Trump administration pushed a  1 5 trillion tax cut through Congress in 2017 on the promise that it would spark sustained economic growth  While the tax cuts have goosed the economy in the short term  officials now concede they will not be enough to deliver the 3 percent annual growth the president promised over the long term To produce that average growth rate for the next decade  White House forecasters say  the American economy would need additional rollbacks in labor regulations  a  1 trillion infrastructure plan and another round of tax cuts Getting all those policies implemented would be highly unlikely  given a divided Congress and a ballooning federal deficit  which could limit lawmakers  appetite to spend money on a new tax cut or infrastructure plan But without those additional steps  the president s economic team predicts in a report released on Tuesday that growth would slow to about 2 percent a year in 2026  That is the year when many of the individual tax cuts included in the 2017 law are set to expire  essentially producing a tax increase for millions of Americans Most forecasters project economic growth of about 2 percent in the medium and long run for the United States  but that rate would fall far short of the heady promises that President Trump has made about his ability to fuel the American economy  Mr  Trump has predicted growth of as much as 5 percent  while his advisers have routinely promoted 3 percent as the new normal  Growth averaged just over 2 percent from 2010  the first full year after the Great Recession ended  through 2016  when Mr  Trump was elected to the White House Even if all the new measures were adopted  growth would slow over time  but it would still stand at 2 8 percent at the end of the decade  the White House forecasters say Mr  Trump s Council of Economic Advisers outlined the projections on Tuesday in the annual Economic Report of the President  As is customary for all administrations  Mr  Trump s advisers built their forecasts around the presumption that all of Mr  Trump s policy proposals would be enacted in the years to come Those include making permanent the individual tax cuts from 2017 and the infrastructure package that Mr  Trump occasionally mentions in speeches  but that has never gained serious consideration in Congress They also include steps to roll back regulations   many of which are at the state level and out of the control of Congress   that the administration says serve as a barrier to more Americans working  It cites occupational licensing rules  which restrict workers from entering certain fields without certification  and regulations that raise the cost of child care  such as caps on the ratio of children to staff in day care centers  One way to reduce the financial burdens of child care for both single and married females considering working is to reduce the direct costs of care   the report says  adding   Regulations that impose minimum standards on providers can decrease the availability and increase the cost of obtaining care  thus serving as a disincentive to work  Although the White House forecasts consider those deregulatory efforts and infrastructure spending to be nearly as important to growth as tax cuts  Mr  Trump has made relatively little effort to push states and Congress to enact them The reliance on new policies to power additional growth helps explain some of the difference in optimism for future growth between White House forecasters and their counterparts in the Federal Reserve  the Congressional Budget Office and the private sector  who all project significantly slower growth over the next 10 years than Mr  Trump does It does not explain why the White House has so much more faith in 3 percent growth this year than other forecasters  who have whittled down their expectations for 2019 in light of increased global obstacles to growth and weaker than expected readings of the domestic economy so far this year On Wednesday  the Fed will release its new economic projections  which many analysts expect will show a slight softening in growth as a result of a prolonged trade war and an economic slowdown overseas The forecast that the Council of Economic Advisers released on Tuesday predicts 3 2 percent growth for 2019   nearly a full point higher than the growth expected by the Fed The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers  Kevin Hassett  said the administration s faith in long term economic growth came from their forecasters  ability to correctly peg growth in 2017 and 2018 Mr  Hassett told reporters on Monday that it was the council s job to model growth assuming the president s policies were fully enacted  He said he was not certain they would be  Ask me as an economist  what are the odds that the tax cuts become permanent right now  I d say 50 50   Mr  Hassett said But he said the council has been encouraged by the early results of the 2017 tax cuts  particularly on investment  In a conference call on Tuesday  he said he was aware of risks to the global economy this year but did not believe a recession was likely in 2020  The idea that we would have a recession next year  it s certainly not impossible   Mr  Hassett said   Recessions very often happen  and few people see them coming  But it would be very unusual for such a thing to happen given the maximum amount of capital spending and new capacity that s being brought online  
SYDNEY  Australia   Money raised for a teenager who shot to worldwide fame after smashing an egg on the head of an Australian far right politician will go toward the victims of the New Zealand mosque shootings  according to his fund raising page On Tuesday morning  a GoFundMe page for Will Connolly  now commonly known as Egg Boy  had already surpassed its goal of raising 50 000 Australian dollars  about  35 000  An update on the page said the 17 year old Mr  Connolly  plans to send a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terror attack   The funds were originally intended to cover his legal fees and to help him buy  more eggs  The teenager gained fame after smashing an egg on the head of Fraser Anning  an anti immigration senator  as the senator spoke to reporters in Melbourne  Australia  on Friday  The incident happened after Mr  Anning was widely condemned for a statement he made that day blaming Muslim immigration for Friday s massacre in Christchurch  New Zealand After getting hit with the egg  Mr  Anning turned around and struck Mr  Connolly in the face twice  A brawl broke out that ended with Mr  Connolly being pinned down by men in the crowd  Mr  Connolly was arrested at the scene and released pending further investigation  the police said As video of the incident went viral  people around the world have rallied around  Egg Boy  as a hero and symbol in the fight against bigotry  Mr  Connolly has been offered concert tickets for life and free vacations  and he has been portrayed in street art and on T shirts But Mr  Anning deplored his behavior in remarks Monday  He got a slap across the face  which is what his mother should have given him long ago because he s been misbehaving badly   Mr  Anning told reporters in Brisbane  The senator refused to apologize for his comments on the shooting  saying it was a  statement of fact  More than a million people have signed a petition calling for Mr  Anning s resignation  Political leaders  including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand and Scott Morrison  her Australian counterpart  have condemned the senator s statement Mr  Connolly has not responded to requests for comment  According to screenshots from the GoFundMe page  he has said he is  under strict restrictions to limit his posts on social media  The teenager has been  overwhelmed  with positive messages and was cooperating with the police as they investigated the incident  Peter Gordon  a lawyer representing Mr  Connolly  told reporters on Tuesday He said his client was  committed that every cent of the money raised from the GoFundMe page go towards supporting the victims of the tragedy in Christchurch  
WASHINGTON   The Defense Department s inspector general said on Wednesday that it was investigating complaints that the acting defense secretary  Patrick M  Shanahan  had been promoting his former employer  Boeing  and disparaging its military contractor competitors The investigation will examine complaints filed last week by a watchdog group  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  Dwrena K  Allen  a spokeswoman for the inspector general s office  said that investigators had informed Mr  Shanahan of the inquiry  Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty  conflict and consequence  Mr  Shanahan told lawmakers last week that he supported an investigation The investigation complicates what is already an uphill battle for Mr  Shanahan s effort to become the next permanent defense secretary  As recently as last week  Defense Department officials believed that President Trump was about to formally nominate Mr  Shanahan for the job left vacant by Jim Mattis  who resigned in December But as Mr  Shanahan s troubles mount  the White House does not appear to have a ready and able alternative to him Jim Talent  the former senator of Missouri  is one name which White House officials have discussed  according to former and current administration officials  Also under consideration is Robert L  Wilkie  the Veterans Affairs secretary  But Mr  Wilkie is viewed as doing a good job in a troubled department and Mr  Trump is loath to remove him from his post  the officials said The deadly crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet in Ethiopia  along with growing complaints that his cozy relationship with his former employers at the detriment of other military contractors  puts Mr  Shanahan s fate in limbo Mr  Shanahan served as the Pentagon s deputy secretary under Mr  Mattis  a job that required Senate confirmation  Before that  he spent 30 years in commercial aviation and business at Boeing  He had hoped to bring his reputation as a corporate problem solver   including helping introduce the 787 Dreamliner   to the Defense Department Several Defense Department officials predicted this week that it was unclear whether Mr  Shanahan could win Senate confirmation for the Pentagon s top job  given his longstanding ties with Boeing and the fallout from the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines plane The transportation secretary  Elaine L  Chao  called on Tuesday for her agency s internal watchdog to investigate the process by which the Federal Aviation Administration in 2017 approved designs for the 737 Max  Lawmakers in Congress also are pushing for a review  while Canada is looking into its approval of the plane s American certification The specific allegations that the Defense Department s inspector general is examining revolve around complaints  first reported in Politico  that Mr  Shanahan disparaged competitors of Boeing during meetings at the Pentagon with senior national security officials and lawmakers  two United States officials said Senator Elizabeth Warren  Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Armed Services Committee that would consider Mr  Shanahan s confirmation if he is nominated  said she alerted the Pentagon s internal watchdog after hearing that he  may have advocated on behalf of his former employer  Boeing  while serving as the acting defense secretary   The American people should be able to trust that government officials are working for them   not for big defense contractors   Ms  Warren  who is running for president  said in a statement While Mr  Mattis resigned in protest of Mr  Trump s policies   including the surprise announcement that American troops would withdraw from Syria   Mr  Shanahan has held the line for the president As the deputy defense secretary  Mr  Shanahan made clear that  we are not the Department of No   as he told officials after the administration announced plans to create a new stand alone Space Force at the Pentagon  It has since been moved to the oversight of the Air Force Since becoming acting defense secretary  Mr  Shanahan has raised the ire of some lawmakers  Last month  Senator James M  Inhofe  Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee  said he did not believe Mr  Shanahan shared the  humility  of Mr  Mattis but did not elaborate  Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina  also clashed with Mr  Shanahan last month over the planned troop withdrawal from Syria Last week  Mr  Shanahan appeared in front of Mr  Inhofe s committee to sell the Pentagon s proposed  750 billion budget for the 2020 fiscal year  which is geared toward combating threats from Russia and China and modernizing a military that has long focused on counterinsurgency conflicts Instead  senators accosted him on a range of issues  including Mr  Trump s move to take billions of dollars from the Defense Department for a border wall  and the Pentagon s decision to push for weaker standards on chemicals in drinking water 
AUCKLAND  New Zealand   Jacinda Ardern  the prime minister of New Zealand  has been exemplary in her response to the massacre in Christchurch  where 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques by an Australian white supremacist and his accomplices  Ms  Arden provided a frame for national grief by embracing the Muslim immigrant community and by firmly insisting  in a tweet after the attack   Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities   New Zealand is their home   they are us   She set the tone for the country s response  framed the incident as a terrorist attack and insisted that her country will reject violent extremism Ms  Ardern  38  took over as prime minister in October 2017  after generating a measure of  Jacindamania  and leading her New Zealand Labour Party to victory  Her stature as a serious progressive politician has not been affected by her celebrity status  Ms  Ardern leads in polls even as some of her policies receive mixed reviews Christchurch marks a turning point for Ms  Ardern and for New Zealand  She has set high benchmarks for messaging and leadership during this crisis  She is expected to unveil specific proposals to reform the country s gun laws before Monday  Ms Ardern  wearing a black scarf  comforted families of the victims   a remarkable gesture given the reactions Muslim women s headgear provokes in many Western countries New Zealanders have followed their leader s example  Citizens are declaring that the attacker does not speak for them  donations are pouring in for families  condolence books are being signed  flowers placed in front of mosques  On Sunday  church congregations sang New Zealand s soaring national anthem that speaks about  men of every creed and race  gathering before God s face in a  free land  Through the aftermath  Ms  Ardern has consciously sought to reinforce state ideology and elevate it above private prejudice  She recognizes politics as the domain that decides a nation s values and is providing strong narrative direction for a society suddenly dealing with exposed fault lines  She is reminding Kiwis to come to terms with the altered composition of her nation and  in fact  told Donald Trump that the best way he could support New Zealand was by offering  sympathy and love for all Muslim communities   On Tuesday  while speaking in the Parliament  she told the grieving families   We cannot know your grief  but we can walk with you at every stage   And in a pathbreaking gesture  Ms  Ardern said she will never mention the name of the terrorist  thus withholding the notoriety he sought  She implored others to  speak the names of those who were lost  rather than name of the man who took them   ImagePrime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaking to reporters on Saturday  in Wellington  New Zealand CreditMark Tantrum Getty ImagesMs  Ardern is emerging as the definitive progressive antithesis to the crowded field of right wing strongmen like President Trump  Viktor Orban of Hungary and Narendra Modi of India  whose careers thrive on illiberal  anti Muslim rhetoric Like its exceptional prime minister  New Zealand has a national culture unlike any other in Europe or the Americas  Its isolation and distance makes its distinctiveness possible  and the difference is palpable  It is a spectacularly beautiful country with a population of five million occupying an area larger than Britain  Though an urbanized country with a stable developed economy  it has a pace and an outlook of life that seem at odds with the extractive demands of modernity Migrants from developing countries relate easily to friendly Kiwis and are often surprised to see children and adults walk the streets barefoot  There are superb public libraries and innumerable public spaces in the form of beaches  bays and parks  Community ties are crucial  work life balance matters  long weekends are sacred  Public funded advice bureaus help migrants settle in  The streets are safe  schools are free and university costs are relatively modest  Kiwis complain about lack of public investment in specialized health care but it is already impressive for a foreigner  a full course of prescribed antibiotics costs  3 43  New Zealand grapples with neoliberal pressures but is attempting to hold on to its social democracy Of course  the country has its problems  Lack of housing is a serious concern  attributed to a property market spiked reportedly by Chinese investors over the years  Maori communities seek compensation for historical dispossession  which is being addressed by a tribunal and conscious promotion of indigenous culture  Mental health comes up as an underdiscussed issue and public infrastructure needs more investment Cities like Auckland grew rapidly in the last decade owing to thousands of foreign students and workers  which increased pressure on services in ways that Kiwis did not expect  Many New Zealanders are still getting used to diversity and often regret that  the country has changed   This yields resentment among some that right wing figures seek to stoke  Muslims have been subject to racial slurs and hate speech since the Sept  11 attacks in the United States  but as Mohamed Hassan  a Kiwi journalist put it  not in ways that one s  life would be on the line   But there is a vibrant political debate on immigration and about the need to import skilled labor without provoking domestic tensions   all conducted without rancor or vitriol  Migrants will not deny sensing subtle forms of exclusion in securing jobs or promotions at work  but the ingrained commitment to everyday civility among New Zealanders is something an immigrant appreciates the most Ms  Ardern has a tough road ahead to ensure that the country s  profile  does not change  The challenges she faces resonate with those in other democracies  It remains to be seen if in her case normative habits and deliberative practice can prevail over nasty right wing subcultures that are amplified by technology  social media and weapons Combating bigotry and prejudice entails both law enforcement and cultural change  The former is easier  the latter less so  Ms  Ardern will need to use her country s civility to confront social divisions rather than allow it to foster silences that block a fuller expression of equality for marginal groups  Her government will need to craft newer meanings of national belonging to translate the tolerated and unwanted into the desirable  Democratic discourses must ultimately aim to bridge ethnic silos and parallel cultural lives  It is a challenge fraught with risk for a liberal politician  as a perceived overreach in social engineering can provoke a conservative backlash  It is not easy dealing with both a grieving community and a nation whose self image has been dented  Right now her moral clarity is inspiring the world Sushil Aaron is an Indian journalist currently based in

Legislature  It failed  with a tie vote of 8 8 in the House In the two years that followed  the Peratroviches redoubled their efforts  urging Native Alaskans to campaign for seats in the Legislature and taking their cause on the road to gain support  They even left their children in the care of an orphanage for a summer so that they could travel across the state more freely By the time the new bill reached the Senate floor  on Feb  5  1945  Congress had increased the size of the territory s Legislature  two Natives had been elected to it  and Alaska s House had already approved the bill  Though the odds of passage were high  the bill set off hours of passionate debate and drew so many onlookers that the crowd spilled out of the gallery doors Senator Allen Shattuck argued that the measure would  aggravate rather than allay  racial tensions  Who are these people  barely out of savagery  who want to associate with us whites with 5 000 years of recorded civilization behind us   he was quoted as saying in Gruening s 1973 autobiography   Many Battles  When the floor was opened to public comments  Peratrovich set down her knitting needles and rose from her seat in the back Taking the podium  she said   I would not have expected that I  who am barely out of savagery  would have to remind the gentlemen with 5 000 years of recorded civilization behind them of our Bill of Rights  She gave examples of the injustices that she and her family had faced because of their background and called on the lawmakers to act   You as legislators   she said   can assert to the world that you recognize the evil of the present situation and speak your intent to help us overcome discrimination  Her testimony  The Daily Alaska Empire wrote  shamed the opposition into a  defensive whisper  The gallery broke out in a  wild burst of applause   Gruening wrote  The 1945 Anti Discrimination Act was passed  11 5 ImagePeratrovich and others on Feb  16  1945  with Ernest Gruening  Alaska s governor

 Alaska Territorial Governors CollectionGruening signed the bill into law on Feb  16   a date now celebrated by the state each year  The legislation entitled all Alaskans to  full and equal enjoyment  of public establishments  setting a misdemeanor penalty for violators  It also banned discriminatory signage based on race It was the first antidiscrimination act in the United States  It would be nearly 20 years before the federal Civil Rights Act would be passed  in 1964  and 14 years before Alaska would become a state In 2020  the United States Mint will commemorate Peratrovich on a  1 coin  A gallery of the Alaska House of Representatives has been named in her honor  and a bronze bust sculpted by her son Roy Jr  adorns the lobby of the State Capitol And yet  aside from her lauded speech   most people know very little about her   said Annie Boochever  whose biography   Fighter in Velvet Gloves   written with Roy Peratrovich Jr   was published this year   My mother was determined to stand her ground  but she would always do it with grace and dignity   Roy Jr  wrote in the introduction She was born on July 4  1911  in Petersburg  in what was then the District of Alaska  the daughter of a Native woman and her mother s Irish brother in law  The two left her in the care of the Salvation Army  and she was adopted by Andrew Wanamaker  a Presbyterian minister  and his wife  Jean  a basket weaver  Wanamaker was a charter member of the Alaska Native Brotherhood  a nonprofit organization formed to address racism Elizabeth grew up speaking Tlingit and English and living at a subsistence level with her parents in Sitka  a coastal city in the archipelago of southeast Alaska  When she was 10  the family moved more than 100 miles further southeast to Klawock  a Native village on Prince of Wales Island  There she met her future husband  the son of a  fisherman from the Balkans  and a Tlingit woman  Though they had attended separate boarding schools  they both graduated from the public high school in Ketchikan  about 70 miles east of Klawock   The school had been integrated after a Tlingit leader successfully sued the school board They married in 1931 and returned to Klawock  where Roy Peratrovich worked as a policeman  a chief clerk and a postmaster  He then served as the village mayor for four terms  He was also a member and grand president of the Alaska Native Brotherhood Elizabeth raised their children  Roy Jr   Frank Allen and Loretta Marie  She loved to dance and  enjoyed watching wrestling on television  she knew all of Gorgeous George s moves and often yelled at the screen as she watched  Dad just looked at me and said   That s your mother     Roy Jr  said in an interview   We laughed  In 1941  the Peratroviches moved hundreds of miles north to bustling Juneau  the capital of what was by then the Alaska Territory  to play a larger role in regional politics  By the time Elizabeth was elected grand president of the Alaska Native Sisterhood  a counterpart to the Brotherhood  in 1944  Roy was leading the Brotherhood Together they would lay a civil rights framework for future generations  said Paulette Moreno  the Sisterhood s current grand president She likened their efforts to  house posts   the often beautifully carved structures upon which a traditional Tlingit house stands  Yet  she said   The shelter is not solid or complete because we witness discrimination and harassment in our communities today  But Elizabeth and Roy have given us role models  In 1954  Roy Peratrovich accepted a position with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and moved the family to Oklahoma  But when Elizabeth learned in 1956 that she had breast cancer  they returned to Juneau  Once her illness worsened  she entered a Christian Science care center in Seattle  where Roy Jr  was attending college She died on Dec  1  1958  at 47 She was buried in the shade of a Sitka spruce in Juneau s Evergreen Cemetery  beside a plot reserved for her husband  who died in 1989 Every year  a groundskeeper opens the bollards that block street access to the grave for one day  on Feb  16   Elizabeth Peratrovich Day 
This article is part of David Leonhardt s newsletter  You can sign up here to receive it each weekday The Democratic Party no longer has a clear policy on immigration It used to  not so long ago  The party s leaders knew what they favored and felt comfortable saying so  Their platform generally included  1  a path to citizenship for immigrants who came to this country illegally but had since obeyed the law  2  deportation of undocumented immigrants who had since broken the law in significant ways  3  fairly robust border security and investigation of companies employing undocumented immigrants  to hold down current and future levels of illegal immigration Besides favoring these policies  Democrats were also willing to talk about the benefits of limiting immigration and of assimilation   Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Consider this 2015 statement from Bernie Sanders   What right wing people in this country would love is an open border policy   I don t believe in that  I think we have to raise wages in this country  Or this 2006 line from Barack Obama  in his book   The Audacity of Hope    When I see Mexican flags waved at pro immigration demonstrations  I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment  Or this comment last year from Hillary Clinton   I think Europe needs to get a handle on migration   It earned her immediate condemnation from progressives and a scathing story in The Times I understand why the Democratic Party has moved to the left on immigration policy over the past few years  It is  in significant part  an honorable reaction to Donald Trump s anti immigrant racism and a desire to stand up for immigrants during his presidency  The Trump administration has separated immigrant children from their parents  and Democrats are trying to protect those families What s less clear to me is exactly what the Democratic Party s new position on immigration is Questions to answerAmong the questions that I d like Democrats to answer What kind of border security do you believe in  Do you favor the policies Obama put in place to reduce illegal immigration   or a different approach Do you believe that immigrants who enter this country illegally should be allowed to stay  If not  which categories of undocumented immigrants should be at risk of deportation   In a 2016 debate  Clinton and Sanders didn t offer clear answers when Univision s Jorge Ramos asked similar questions  What do you believe should happen to future levels of legal immigration  And what should happen to the mix of different categories of immigration  Should family connections play as large a role as they now do  Should workplace skills continue to play a small role Do you believe  as Sanders suggested in 2015  that more immigration can reduce wages  especially for lower income workers and recent immigrants themselves My own view is that the country benefits from significant limits on immigration  As David Frum notes in a recent cover story for The Atlantic  immigration levels were quite low for much of the 20th century   from roughly the 1910s through the 1970s  The slowdown helped many of the immigrants who arrived in the waves before 1910  including parts of my family   They faced less competition in the labor market  Labor unions were more easily able to grow  because they were organizing an increasingly assimilated workforce  The immigration slowdown played a role in the great income surge of the post World War II decades  Today  I d favor a policy with a lot of similarities to the Democrats  platform of the Obama years  including humane treatment of immigrants already here plus tight border security  I d change the mix of immigration  to let in fewer low skills immigrants and more high skills immigrants  Doing so has the potential to reduce inequality and lift economic growth I recognize that this platform is probably too conservative for many Democrats  But high levels of immigration  stretching over many decades  is not an American tradition  It s something new  and it brings both upsides and downsides For anyone who wants to think through the subject  I recommend Frum s article   The politician quotations above come from it   For critiques of Frum s piece  see Nancy LeTourneau in Washington Monthly and Noah Smith of Bloomberg Opinion If nothing else  I d urge Democrats to look at public opinion on immigration with an open mind  The polling isn t as favorable as some of the recent conversation on the left has suggested  In a recent Gallup poll  47 percent of Americans called illegal immigration a critical threat and another 30 percent called it an important threat I wouldn t call it either of those  But I do think it s folly   both substantively and politically   to pretend that more immigration is always better than less  And I think it s a mistake for Democrats to be so unclear about what their party s immigration agenda is If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter  you can subscribe here  You can also join me on Twitter   DLeonhardt  and Facebook Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook

MOSCOW   After 30 years in power  the aging president of Kazakhstan jolted the oil rich former Soviet republic and the region at large on Tuesday with the surprise announcement that he was resigning Nursultan Nazarbayev  78  the last surviving president in Central Asia to have steered his country to independence after the Soviet Union collapsed  stepped away from running daily affairs  but maintained considerable authority over the sprawling country sandwiched between Russia and China While Kazakhs welcomed the announcement as the potential start of a new era  analysts surmised that the Kremlin would see it in a negative light by drawing attention to the nearly 20 year old leadership of President Vladimir V  Putin and his lack of a clear succession plan Mr  Nazarbayev called the decision to resign difficult  As the founder of the independent Kazakh state  I see my task now in facilitating the rise of a new generation of leaders who will continue the reforms that are underway in the country   Mr  Nazarbayev said in a nationally televised speech that soon led the news in neighboring Russia as well   Until my dying day  I will stay with you  The concerns of the people will stay my concerns  Mr  Nazarbayev said he would hand over his presidential powers immediately to Kassym Jomart Tokayev  the speaker of the upper house of the parliament  which always approves Mr  Nazarbayev s actions  Mr  Tokayev  65  a former prime minister and foreign minister  will serve as acting president until elections scheduled for 2020 Mr  Nazarbayev  a steelworker and Communist Party leader who rose to power in Kazakhstan in 1989  when it was still part of the Soviet Union  will continue as chairman of the powerful Security Council as well of president of the Nur Otan party  which dominates the country  The real levers of power remain in his hands   said Irina Petrushova  the founding editor of Respublika  a now defunct independent newspaper During his autocratic rule  he won repeated elections with nearly 100 percent of the vote each time  often jailing political opponents or journalists who criticized him  Mr  Nazarbayev attracted enormous investments from foreign energy companies to develop the nation s oil reserves  which  at an estimated 30 billion barrels  are among the largest of all the former Soviet republics In foreign policy  Kazakhstan adroitly balanced between its two giant neighbors  Russia and China  while also maintaining friendly ties with the United States That juggling act is expected to continue whether he is succeeded by a relative or a close political ally  Possible successors from his rich but unpopular family include his oldest daughter  Dariga Nazarbayeva  or his nephew  Samat Abish  the deputy head of the National Security Committee Analysts suggested two main reasons for Mr  Nazarbayev s decision to step aside now  First  he wants to organize an orderly transition that will preserve his legacy  After Islam Karimov  another Soviet era autocrat in neighboring Uzbekistan  died in office in 2016  Mr  Nazarbayev watched as the Uzbeks jailed the former president s allies and dismantled his security services  He was conscious of his own international prestige   said Marlene Laruelle  the director of the Central Asia Program at George Washington University in Washington   He thought it would be good to be remembered as a president who stepped aside and did not die in power  Second  although Kazakhstan enjoys considerable oil wealth  the economy has stagnated in recent years with widespread public grumbling about a low living standard and poor social services Mr  Nazarbayev fired his entire Cabinet in February for having failed to address social problems  but  did not want to become the punching bag  attacked by the public as those issues persist  said Cliff Kupchan  chairman of the Eurasia Group  a Washington based consulting group that analyzes political risk Having endured three decades of the same ruler  Kazakhs  especially those politically active over the years  hoped for change   After 30 years of a total swamp  any movement is positive   said Ms  Petrushova In Moscow  Dmitri S  Peskov  the spokesman for President Putin  said the Russian leader had called Mr  Nazarbayev  but refused to comment further  The resignation was welcomed in Russia by members of civil society  which is also grappling with an increasingly domineering state  To leave alive  independently and with dignity  even without going far away   this is probably the greatest mastery for a leader of a country like Kazakhstan  Or Russia   wrote Max Trudolyubov  a Russian political commentator  on Facebook Analysts suggested that the change would exert pressure on the Kremlin  which once ruled Kazakhstan and was the model for its repressive system  to address the succession issue Mr  Nazarbayev was  sending out the image that Russia is unable to find a solution while Kazakhstan has   said Ms  Laruelle  even if Mr  Putin  at 66  is much younger and was just elected last year to another six year term   It is indirectly  symbolically  putting pressure on the Kremlin

To the Editor  More to Fear for Yeshiva Students   editorial  March 8  is critical of the Orthodox Jewish community  Its allusions to politics  lobbyists and other tropes are a diversion from the troubling new State Education Department guidelines that are its subject Those guidelines dictate what classes private schools  including yeshivas  must teach  how and for how long they must be taught and even who can teach private school students  That is why they are being challenged by every sector of New York s private school community Decades ago  the New York Court of Appeals struck down a less invasive effort by the state s Education Department to regulate private schools  declaring that  it would be intolerable     to hand over to any official or group of officials an unlimited and undefined power to make such regulations  Nothing has occurred in the intervening years to empower the state to impose invasive mandates on private schools We live in an era that places a high priority on an increasing array of rights and values  including diversity  It would be odd if a parent s pedagogical preference is no longer her prerogative Avi SchickNew YorkThe writer is a lawyer for Pearls  Parents for Education and Religious Liberty in Schools   which promotes Orthodox Jewish education 
UMM AL FAHM  Israel   With three weeks to go  the Israeli election is so close that Arab voters  who make up only a fifth of the population  could help bring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s long career to an abrupt end Mr  Netanyahu has been fanning the flames of anti Arab sentiment almost daily He has warned Israelis that his main challenger  the retired army chief Benny Gantz  would  hand over parts of the homeland to the Arabs  and that he would make alliances with Arab parties that  want to destroy  Israel  Mr  Netanyahu has also joined forces with a racist faction whose leaders support expelling Arab citizens and call them  the enemy  Such appeals have worked for Mr  Netanyahu in the past  This time they might backfire Small Arab communities like the Druze  who prize their loyalty to the state and often vote for right wing parties  show signs of deserting Mr  Netanyahu en masse  according to a new poll from the University of Maryland  The poll also suggests that Mr  Netanyahu s racial provocations may spur turnout among Arab voters motivated to usher him out of office If the race between Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party and Mr  Netanyahu s Likud remains a nail biter  the swing of a single seat in Parliament could be decisive And the two Arab parties could  as Mr  Netanyahu warns  help make Mr  Gantz the prime minister through postelection deal making  We need to tell Netanyahu   Thank you for your incitement  now go home    said Afif Abu Much  37  a computer engineer and political activist from Baqa al Gharbiyye  a town abutting the West Bank The danger for Mr  Netanyahu is that his belaboring of the threat posed by Palestinians could drive them to the ballot box Based on a new survey of more than 700 Arab voters  Shibley Telhami  director of the University of Maryland s Critical Issues Poll  projects that Arab turnout will rise to 69 percent of eligible Arab voters  up from about 64 percent in 2015  For now  it looks like this strategy is working against Netanyahu  not for him   Mr  Telhami said But with three weeks to go  anything could happen  Mr  Netanyahu s strategy has proved reliable before and could still succeed if it depresses the Arab vote while energizing right wing Israelis ImageA campaign billboard for an Arab party in Umm al Fahm  Some residents are frustrated with the political infighting among Arab parties CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesIt was already a stormy time for Arab citizens of Israel  who were jolted last year by passage of a basic law formally declaring their country the nation state of the Jewish people alone  The law  pushed through by Mr  Netanyahu  downgraded the Arabic language and dealt a blow to ideals of equality Mr  Abu Much still winces at the memory of a slogan in Mr  Netanyahu s first election  in 1996   Bibi is good for the Jews   The implication for Arab voters  many of whom prefer to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel  was clear In his most recent campaign  in 2015  Mr  Netanyahu played on racial enmity on Election Day  warning that Arabs were being bused to the polls  in droves   It energized his supporters  and he won handily  though he drew stern rebukes from the Obama administration and was forced to apologize In a sly wink to that remark  Israel s leading Arab politicians  Ayman Odeh and Ahmad Tibi  are running ads showing themselves smiling in front of buses and urging voters to  flock to the polling stations  This year  with little fear of White House pressure and ample reason not to wait  Mr  Netanyahu has stirred the pot on a daily basis  It s not new  but he s made it into an art form   said Amal Jamal  a professor at Tel Aviv University who specializes in political communication   Begin and Shamir were also racist  Even Rabin also said a few things that  if they were said against Jews in the U S  or the U K   the whole world would be standing on its back feet  But Netanyahu has turned it into the center of the campaign  Mr  Netanyahu s campaign did not respond to a request for comment The prime minister s haranguing against Arabs and their parties was so conspicuous that a popular Israeli model and television host  Rotem Sela  took Mr  Netanyahu to task  writing on Instagram that  the Arabs are also human beings   that  all people are born equal   and that  this is a country of all its citizens  To which Mr  Netanyahu responded with a fresh affront  saying matter of factly that Israel was decidedly not a state of all its citizens   Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people   and not anyone else   he said  adding a day later that Israel s  Arab citizens have 22 nation states around them and they do not need another  Again  the implication was clear   It means he s depicting Arab citizens not only as second class  but as traitors  as a fifth column  as illegitimate   Mr  Jamal said The barbs seem to be taking a toll on the Druze  an Arab ethnic group whose members serve in the Israeli army  prize their loyalty to the state and had been a source of significant support for Mr  Netanyahu  More than half of likely Druze voters are now backing Mr  Gantz  Mr  Telhami said  and Druze support for right wing parties as a whole   already exceptional among Arabs   has plunged to less than 20 percent from around twice that  We are very disappointed   said Manal Birani  47  a Hebrew and math teacher in Daliyat al Karmel  a Druze town near Haifa   Very angry  I hope that Gantz will win  When he says   I m against the nation state law and I ll help you to change it   he wants to change it  ImageRaja Mahmeed  a fishmonger  said he considered himself an Israeli and a Palestinian CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesBut many Arabs say they cannot root for Mr  Gantz  who announced his candidacy with ads trumpeting the numbers of  terrorists  he had killed as army commander during the 2014 war in Gaza  Gantz started his campaign with a confession of war crimes   said Majd Kayyal  a 28 year old novelist living in Haifa  He said he would not vote   I don t care with what instrument I will be oppressed  In Umm al Fahm  a hilly town of 54 000 in the so called Northern Triangle of heavily Arab Israel  residents complain that violent crime receives little attention and the police do little except hand out traffic tickets  When it s a Muslim Arab killing another Muslim Arab  there s nothing done   said Raja Mahmeed  37  a fishmonger in a crowded strip mall   This all comes from the Israeli politics    Let them kill each other    he said Mr  Mahmeed said he would vote either for an Arab party or for Meretz  a left wing party that put up big billboards in the center of town But others  disillusioned by Arab political infighting  say they are sitting out the election   It s useless   said Samir Mahmeed  37  a barber shop manager from the same extended family   Who would I choose  I want to choose someone who works for the Arab community  for Umm al Fahm  No one s doing anything for the Arabs  The practical consequence is that Arabs who abstain   either out of support for a boycott or frustration with the options   are likely to benefit Mr  Netanyahu Perhaps the most poignant finding in Mr  Telhami s new survey was the steady increase in the number of Arabs identifying themselves as Israeli first  rather than Arab  Palestinian or Muslim  That number has been steadily ticking up  to 17 percent  from 12 percent in 2011 At the same time  other polls have shown that nearly half of Israeli Jews would favor expelling all Palestinians  and a large majority believes Jews should have privileges that Arabs do not  It s heartbreaking   Mr  Telhami said   Just as Arabs are getting to be more and more Israeli  the Jews want them to be less Israeli  Raja Mahmeed  the fishmonger  said he considered himself both an Israeli and a Palestinian Israeli  Believe me  the people themselves  in the market  in the street  we and the Jews live together   he said   Our problem is just with Netanyahu  the extreme right wing  If we could just have them leave the government  we could live in peace  
ALBANY    What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  With New York s upstate casinos struggling  some state officials are considering the once unthinkable  putting casinos in New York City itself Representatives from major gaming companies have been meeting this week with lawmakers in Albany  including the Assembly speaker  Carl E  Heastie  to push a proposal to open as many as three full fledged casinos in the New York City area They say that such a move could provide the state hundreds of millions of dollars each year in new revenue and create thousands of new jobs  an argument that has been given extra heft by the collapse of the Amazon deal in Queens  and the ongoing effort to find a financial cure for the city s decrepit subways Under one proposal  Aqueduct Raceway on the Queens border with Long Island and Yonkers Raceway would be converted from so called racinos into full gaming operations  In another  the state would open bidding for up to three casino licenses  clearing the way for a new gambling hub to be built elsewhere in New York City  likely outside of Manhattan The chairmen of the Assembly and Senate gaming committees have thrown their support behind the idea of bringing gaming to New York City  Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo has not closed the door altogether  but he has expressed deep skepticism about an accelerated plan to expand gambling in the state  The leader of the Senate Democrats  Andrea Stewart Cousins  has not publicly stated a position about new casinos  but Mr  Heastie has been historically cool to the idea The companies have proposed paying upstate casino operators about  100 million to counteract the loss of exclusivity   New York had agreed not to issue any more casino licenses until 2023  The three companies also have expressed a willingness to pay the state at least  500 million each to operate in the downstate market Assemblyman Gary Pretlow  a Democrat from Westchester County who leads the Racing and Wagering Committee  was impressed by the amount of money being floated    They are offering  500 million each   he said   adding that such a windfall could improve the state s finances immediately   It could go into this year s budget   he said ImageGov  Andrew M  Cuomo has not closed the door to an expansion of gambling in the state  but he has expressed deep skepticism CreditHans Pennink Associated PressThe upstate casinos are seemingly on board with the expansion plan  But it still faces an uphill slope in Albany  particularly among liberal Democrats in the State Assembly who view gaming as a regressive tax Mr  Cuomo has said he remained  dubious  of any plan to open new casinos before 2023  but he did not outright reject the possibility of expanding casino gambling  giving hope to plans like those backed by Las Vegas Sands  owned by Sheldon Adelson  a prominent supporter of Republican politicians and President Trump  Sands is seeking to open a new luxury casino in New York City  and the company has enlisted the former governor  David Paterson  to advocate on its behalf  I think  in an iconic city like New York  to have an iconic structure  would be another  really beautiful  tourism destination   Mr  Paterson said in an interview  adding that he wished someone had proposed it when he was in office and  we had a  21 billion deficit  Mr  Paterson was referring to shortfalls in the state budget  which is due on April 1  Projected income tax revenue is lower  and agreements to create other revenue streams for the state  including legalized marijuana and congestion pricing  are facing opposition  The looming shortfalls led the governor and legislative leaders last week to signal an accord on a so called pied à terre tax  which will target superluxury second homes in New York City There is also external pressure from neighboring states  as New Jersey continues to embrace and expand betting  and intrastate support  In Yonkers  Mayor Mike Spano signaled support for allowing live dealer table games at the Empire City casino  which  like Aqueduct  currently only has video lottery terminals  which resemble slot machines  So did the Business Council of Westchester  which said the impact of Empire City  cannot be overstated  MGM Resorts  which owns Yonkers Raceway  and the Genting Group  a Malaysian based conglomerate that runs the Resorts World racino at Aqueduct  have stressed the speed with which they could transform their current operations in Yonkers and at Aqueduct Racetrack into full fledged casinos  arguing they could be up and running within months  as opposed to the years it might take for an outside company to start from scratch  Resorts World is a proven operator ready to move immediately once given the authorization   said Michael Levoff  a spokesman for the Genting Group  noting that the Aqueduct casino had been operating in Queens for seven years  and generated  over  2 billion in much needed revenue  Sands  meanwhile  seems to be banking on the appeal of construction and other union friendly jobs  The company is already negotiating agreements with at least two major unions  including the Building Construction and Trades Council  whose president was one of the authors of an op ed in early March that advocated for an expansion of casinos downstate as a way to provide  new revenue to improve public transit service  fund public education  and other New York priorities  ImageThe Resorts World Catskills casino was hailed as a potential savior for the historic resort area when it opened last February  but it reported huge losses last year CreditSeth Wenig Associated PressThe argument in favor of expansion was echoed in a letter sent to Mr  Cuomo by the Business Council of New York  a frequent ally of his  arguing that it would add up to   1 5 billion in much needed immediate revenue   though the Council said it was opposed to the idea of  any quick fix approach to convert existing racinos   The process  it said  should be opened to bidding The state has had a staggered and at times stalled approach to gaming  Its first casinos in the modern era came after Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s and 1990s affirmed the right of Native American tribes to run such franchises and a 1993 compact with Mario M  Cuomo  who was the governor at the time  The state s racinos began to open in 2004 and have expanded to nine locations  including Aqueduct and Yonkers In 2013  Mr  Cuomo doubled down  signing legislation to allow seven full fledged casinos  despite warnings about saturation in the gaming market  At the time  the governor promised such facilities were designed to benefit upstate before downstate  assuring no casino license would be granted anywhere near New York City until 2023 But all four newly licensed casinos   Resorts World Catskills Casino in Monticello  N Y   Rivers Casino in Schenectady  the del Lago Resort and Casino  in Tyre  a small town southeast of Rochester  and Tioga Downs Casino Resort  west of Binghamton   have missed their own projections for earnings  Trouble signs are easy to find  Del Lago has been warned about its debt  while Empire Resorts  which owns the Catskills casino  also reported large losses last year Mr  Cuomo has already signed off on allowing the four upstate casinos to offer sports wagering inside the facilities  though he has balked at permitting mobile sports wagering  which New Jersey has embraced But the governor seemed to recognize the potential of a New York City casino  suggesting that such

WASHINGTON   For the first 55 minutes of a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday about racial discrimination in jury selection  the justices seemed united in their view that a white Mississippi prosecutor had violated the Constitution in his determined efforts to exclude black jurors from the six trials of Curtis Flowers  who was convicted of murdering four people in a furniture store As Mr  Flowers s lawyer concluded her argument  Justice Clarence Thomas asked his first questions from the bench since 2016  He wanted to know whether the defense lawyer in the sixth trial had excluded any jurors  The lawyer said yes  And what was the race of the jurors struck there   Justice Thomas asked White  said the lawyer  Sheri Lynn Johnson Justice Thomas holds the modern record for silence on the bench  Before his questions in 2016  he had gone a decade without asking one  His explanations have varied  but he has said lately that the other justices asked so many questions that they were rude to the lawyers before them The balance of the argument went well for Mr  Flowers  whose case has attracted widespread attention  Justices across the ideological spectrum said the track record of the prosecutor  Doug Evans  was deeply troubling  Justice Samuel A  Alito Jr  called it  unusual and really disturbing  In the first four trials  held between 1997 and 2007  Mr  Evans used all 36 of his peremptory challenges   ones that do not require giving a reason   to strike black jurors from serving  Three of those trials ended in convictions reversed on appeal  and one in a mistrial Official court records do not show the racial makeup of the jury pool for the fifth trial  in 2008  but the jury itself included nine white and three black people  It deadlocked  and the judge declared mistrial Over the years  Mississippi courts twice ruled that Mr  Evans had violated Batson v  Kentucky  a 1986 decision that made an exception to the centuries old rule that peremptory challenges are completely discretionary and cannot be second guessed In the Batson case  the court ruled that racial discrimination in jury selection was different  and it required lawyers accused of it to provide a nondiscriminatory explanation Justice Brett M  Kavanaugh  who wrote an article in The Yale Law Journal calling for vigorous enforcement of the Batson decision when he was a law student  said that Mr  Evans s track record in the case mattered in the Supreme Court s assessment of the sixth trial  which took place in 2010  We can t take the history out of the case   he said Even the state s lawyer  Jason Davis  said that  the history in this case is troubling  Chief Justice John G  Roberts Jr  asked whether the court was entitled to take account of that history  and Mr  Davis said it could But he added that Mr  Evans had offered  valid race neutral reasons for each strike  in the sixth trial At that trial  Mr  Evans accepted the first black prospective juror and struck the next five  Mr  Evans questioned black prospective jurors closely  asking an average of 29 questions of each of them  He asked the 11 white jurors who were eventually seated an average of one question each In that disparity  Justice Elena Kagan said   the numbers themselves are staggering  Justices Alito and Sonia Sotomayor both suggested that Mr  Evans should have been taken off the case long ago  Could the attorney general have said  you know  enough already  we re going to send one of our own people   Justice Alito asked Mr  Davis  the state s lawyer Under Mississippi law  Mr  Davis replied  state officials can step in only when requested by local ones like Mr  Evans  and there was no such request in the Flowers case   So that was not an option in this case   he said Much of the argument delved into Mr  Evans s stated reasons for striking jurors in the sixth trial Justice Stephen G  Breyer described the characteristics of two potential jurors  one black and one white  Both were women in their mid 40s who had completed some college  strongly favored the death penalty and had some professional interactions with members of Mr  Flowers s family  Justice Breyer suggested that race had been the decisive factor Justice Elena Kagan seemed to agree  noting that the black potential juror had an uncle who worked as a prison guard and a relative who had been victim of a violent crime   Except for her race   Justice Kagan said   you would think that this is a juror that a prosecutor would love when she walks in the door  The justices had varied responses to whether the reasons offered by Mr  Evans appeared to be pretexts for racial discrimination  But there was something like a consensus that Mr  Evans s past conduct tipped the balance in Mr  Flowers s favor Mr  Flowers s case was the subject of season long examination by the podcast  In the Dark   which raised substantial questions about his guilt  In February  the podcast won a George Polk award  a prestigious journalism prize  for its work about the case While the Supreme Court seemed likely to rule that the jury selection in Mr  Flowers s latest trial was marred by unconstitutional racial discrimination  setting up the possibility of a seventh trial  its ruling is unlikely to establish any fresh legal principles Justice Kavanaugh said the key principle in the Batson decision was sufficient to address the matter   You can t just assume that someone s going to be favorable to someone because they share the same race   he said  Part of Batson was about confidence of the community and the fairness of the criminal justice system   he said   And that was against a backdrop of a lot of decades of all white juries convicting black defendants  When Justice Thomas spoke near the end of the argument  it jolted the courtroom  His three questions suggested that both sides rely on racial stereotypes in picking jurors Justice Sotomayor responded that  with one exception  the defense lawyer could not have stricken any potential black jurors because Mr  Evans had already excluded them all Justice Thomas has offered shifting reasons for his silence during Supreme Court arguments  In his 2007 memoir   My Grandfather s Son   he wrote that he had never asked questions in college or law school and that he had been intimidated by some of his fellow students He has also said he was self conscious about the way he spoke  partly because he had been teased about the accent he grew up with in Georgia  But in recent years  he has mostly said that he did not ask questions out of simple courtesy On the last two occasions on which he asked questions  in 2016 and on Wednesday  Justice Thomas asked questions only after the last lawyer finished early and was about to sit down

TAIPEI  Taiwan   Taiwan s president  Tsai Ing wen  will travel to the South Pacific on Thursday to shore up ties with three island nations that still recognize Taiwan as a country  in an effort to offset China s expanding influence in the region Only 17 countries recognize Taiwan s government  and among those  Ms  Tsai will be visiting Palau  Nauru and the Marshall Islands China has been pouring aid and investment into the Pacific islands  raising the question of whether Beijing could strip Taiwan of more of its few remaining diplomatic allies and shrink the self ruled island s international presence The Trump administration has sought to push back against China s reach in the South Pacific and Latin America  Australia is also concerned  and last year set aside more money in its budget for Pacific aid For the small  developing countries that still recognize Taiwan  the primary reason to consider switching recognition to Beijing from Taipei is the aid and investment that China offers  But potential economic benefits may come at a cost  officials and analysts in Taiwan and the United States have warned  Growing Chinese economic influence over time may be translated into political and strategic influence   said Bonnie Glaser  director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies  Commercial investment in a port  for example  could lead to military access  she said   This is especially of concern in Latin America  a region that the U S  has long considered its backyard  United States diplomats have argued to Taiwan s allies that relying too heavily on China is risky  Ms  Glaser said  They have provided data about debt traps they say China has created elsewhere  she added The spokesman for Taiwan s presidential office  Chang Tun han  would not confirm if aid or investment packages would be announced during Ms  Tsai s eight day trip  Ross Feingold  a political analyst in Taipei  Taiwan s capital  said that with elections coming up in Nauru and the Marshall Islands this year  Ms  Tsai was very likely to pledge assistance of some kind ImageTaiwan s foreign minister  Joseph Wu  says China is using its state owned construction and engineering companies to approach governments in Latin America about switching recognition to China from Taiwan CreditBilly H C  Kwok for The New York TimesMs  Tsai will make a stop in Hawaii on her way back next Wednesday   a transit that could annoy Beijing  The United States shifted to recognizing China s Communist government in 1979  but still maintains unofficial relations with Taipei China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has long sought to reduce the number of countries that recognize it  Since Ms  Tsai came to power in 2016  Beijing has poached five of Taiwan s diplomatic allies  China has also stepped up pressure on the island democracy by increasing its military activities near Taiwanese waters and airspace For Taiwan s government  the 17 countries that still officially recognize it are of symbolic importance because they support Taiwan s claim to statehood  The most immediate questions hang over two Pacific island nations that Ms  Tsai will not be visiting   Kiribati and the Solomon Islands According to Taiwanese news reports  she had initially planned to visit Kiribati on this trip  but the stop was called off because of what officials said were scheduling conflicts  Last May  initial plans for a visit by Ms  Tsai to Burkina Faso were similarly shelved shortly before the country severed ties with Taipei Rick Hou  the prime minister of the Solomon Islands  has said he will review the relationship with Taiwan if he is re elected this year  China has become a major export destination for the Solomon Islands in recent years  primarily driven by unsustainable logging of the country s rain forests China is aggressively pumping money into the South Pacific via President Xi Jinping s Belt and Road Initiative  said Karl Eikenberry  director of the U S  Asia Security Initiative at the Shorenstein Asia Pacific Research Center  The Chinese initiative is a sweeping plan for infrastructure investment to more closely link China with Asia  Africa and Europe  A lot of the money that they re investing isn t transparent   Mr  Eikenberry said at a news conference at Taiwan s Institute for National Defense and Security Research on Tuesday   It s corrupting political systems   Do they see strategic utility in having a presence in those Pacific island nations   he said   The answer is yes  Late last month  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at a gathering of South Pacific nations  including the leaders of the Marshall Islands  Kiribati and Palau  praising the countries for their recognition of Taiwan ImageSoldiers hoisting the national flag at Liberty Square in Taipei  Taiwan s capital  China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has long sought to reduce the number of countries that recognize it CreditDavid Chang EPA  via Shutterstock We respect and support the decision those of you have made to continue to support Taiwan   Mr  Pompeo said Latin America is also a source of worry for Taiwan Taiwan s foreign minister  Joseph Wu  told journalists last week that China is using its large state owned construction and engineering companies to approach governments of Taipei s diplomatic allies in Latin America about switching recognition to Beijing  All these countries that are not able to finance the projects themselves need to get loans from China   that s debt trap diplomacy   Mr  Wu said Mr  Wu cited as examples Panama and El Salvador  which normalized relations with China in June 2017 and August 2018 The Trump administration has stepped into the diplomatic tug of war  In September  the State Department recalled its top diplomats from the two countries  as well as the Dominican Republic  which dropped Taiwan for China last May El Salvador s ties with China have become a question  Nayib Bukele  the new president elect  said after a speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington this month that he was reviewing his country s relations with Beijing  suggesting that reverting to recognition of Taiwan was a possibility Before Mr  Bukele was elected last month  his predecessor  Salvador Sánchez Cerén  met with Mr  Xi and secured  150 million in aid from China for 13 projects  the details of which were not made public Mr  Bukele said Beijing was selling projects to countries that cannot repay the loans that come attached to them   They go in  they do projects that are not feasible  then they leave the countries with huge loans they cannot repay and they use as a kind of leverage  John Bolton  President Trump s national security adviser  met with Mr  Bukele during his visit and said the United States would work with Mr  Bekele to  counter Chinese predatory practices  Lu Kang  a spokesman for China s Foreign Ministry  told reporters last week that the ties between China and El Salvador  should be cherished by both sides  and that Beijing would work with Mr  Bukele to  steer clear of external disturbances

It comes as little surprise  sadly  that the Saudi thugs who slaughtered Jamal Khashoggi were a secret crew of enforcers for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  They had been watching  kidnapping  detaining and torturing Saudi dissidents for more than a year before they traveled to Istanbul to kill and dismember the Washington Post journalist  According to a report in The Times by Mark Mazzetti and Ben Hubbard  citing officials who have read classified intelligence  the team is known to American officials as the  Saudi Rapid Intervention Group  and it carried out at least a dozen operations before the Khashoggi murder This comes as little surprise because of all the sordid information that has come out about the Saudi hit men and the crown prince since the brazen assassination of Mr  Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul shocked the world in October  and because of the clumsy initial attempts by Prince Mohammed to deny the killing and then to pin it on underlings who purportedly exceeded their orders and are now said to be standing trial in a courtroom no independent witnesses have been to In the five months since the killing  most of the world has learned that Prince Mohammed is not the modernizing liberal of the image he cultivated among Western leaders and visitors but rather a despot who suppressed those who challenged his image and his power That he would create a secret team of enforcers further affirms that Mr  Khashoggi s killing was not some rogue operation by loyal courtiers against a nettlesome critic  Instead  it was part of a systematic campaign to silence dissidents that was overseen by a top aide to Prince Mohammed  Saud al Qahtani  and led in the field by an intelligence officer who had traveled abroad with the crown prince  Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb  According to the American officials  the team was worked so hard that last June it asked for holiday bonuses Saudi Arabia  an absolute monarchy with a particularly stern form of Islam  has always been high on the list of human rights violators  But with the ascent of Prince Mohammed s father  King Salman  to the throne in January 2015  and with Prince Mohammed s subsequent emergence as the heir and the power behind the throne  the pace of arrests  repression and executions rose to levels unseen in two decades According to a Saudi group that tracks political prisoners  Prisoners of Conscience  more than 2 600 Saudi dissidents   including scientists  writers  lawyers and women s rights campaigners   were locked up in the kingdom while the crown prince was building his image abroad as a reformer  His celebrated decision to let women drive  in the best known example  was accompanied by the imprisonment of the women who had campaigned for the right The revelation that the killing of Mr  Khashoggi was part of a systematic campaign against dissidents strips away any remaining illusions about Prince Mohammed  The Guardian newspaper has reported signs that King Salman has begun to curb his son s power and that Prince Mohammed has missed a series of high profile ministerial and diplomatic meetings over the past two weeks President Trump and his senior adviser and son in law Jared Kushner  who shaped much of their Middle East policy around their friendly relations with the crown prince  have tried to minimize the fallout from the Khashoggi killing  But the Senate demonstrated last week that it was prepared to part with the president on Saudi Arabia when it voted 54 to 46 to end American military assistance for the Saudi led war in Yemen  a conflict that has created a humanitarian crisis in the country  The House is expected to follow suit Congress should demand a full disclosure of intelligence records about Mr  Khashoggi s murder  about the team that committed it and about the role of Prince Mohammed  It also needs to demand the immediate release of the political prisoners in whose support Mr  Khashoggi wrote the articles that sealed his fate  And even if Mr  Trump insists on continuing to back this damaged and damaging prince  the president should be using his leverage to extract such concessions on human rights  RelatedIt Wasn t Just Khashoggi  A Saudi Prince s Brutal Drive to Crush DissentMarch 17  2019Opinion   The Editorial BoardThe House Finally Acts on YemenFeb  14  2019Opinion   The Editorial BoardSaudi Arabia s Threadbare Cover Up of Khashoggi s Killing Unravels FurtherFeb  8  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram 
In 2018  the United States executed 25 people and over 2 700 prisoners remain on  death row   It is one of only 56 nations in the world that still practice capital punishment Last week  California Gov  Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on capital punishment in his state  Watch the one minute video above announcing his decision Should the United States as a country stop using the death penalty  Is it ever justified  such as for the most heinous crimes  Or do you think it is always cruel and unusual punishment  Alternatively  do you think it should be suspended for practical reasons  such as because it is costly or sometimes unfairly administered In  California Death Penalty Suspended  737 Inmates Get Stay of Execution   Tim Arango writes LOS ANGELES   Gov  Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on capital punishment on Wednesday  granting a temporary reprieve for the 737 inmates on the state s death row  the largest in the Western Hemisphere The move is highly symbolic because legal challenges have already stalled executions in California  the last one was in 2006  But death penalty opponents hope that because of California s size and political importance  the governor s action will give new urgency to efforts to end executions in other states as popular support for the death penalty wanes Mr  Newsom  a longtime opponent of capital punishment  cited its high cost  racial disparities in its application and wrongful convictions  and questioned whether society has the right to take a life  I know people think eye for eye  but if you rape  we don t rape   he said   And I think if someone kills  we don t kill  We re better than that  He continued   I cannot sign off on executing hundreds and hundreds of human beings  knowing   knowing   that among them will be innocent human beings  Supporters of capital punishment said the move went against the will of the state s residents  California voters have rejected an initiative to abolish the death penalty and in 2016  they narrowly approved Proposition 66 to help speed it up  I think this would be a bold step and I think he s got to be aware of the political downside   said Michael D  Rushford  president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation  an organization in Sacramento that favors the death penalty and helped draft the ballot proposition  speaking before the governor s announcement   Voters have had multiple opportunities in California over three decades to abandon the death penalty and they ve shut them down at every chance  The article continues After the news of Mr  Newsom s decision broke  Mr  Trump said on Twitter   Defying voters  the Governor of California will halt all death penalty executions of 737 stone cold killers  Friends and families of the always forgotten VICTIMS are not thrilled  and neither am I  Speaking several hours later  Mr  Newsom said he had met with families of victims and they had expressed passionate but conflicting views on capital punishment  But the governor made it clear that his decision came down to his own conscience  prodded by impending decisions such as whether to support the state s lethal injection protocol An executive order Mr  Newsom signed on Wednesday does three things  grants reprieves to the inmates currently on death row   they will still be under a death sentence  but not at risk of execution  closes the execution chamber at San Quentin prison  and withdraws the state s lethal injection protocol  the formally approved procedure for carrying out executions  Three out of four nations in the world know better and are doing better   Mr  Newsom said   They ve abolished the death penalty  It s time California join those ranks  The article concludes Opponents of the death penalty  including Mr  Newsom  have long argued that the practice is rife with racial disparities and is not justified by the high cost to state taxpayers  One study  in 2011  found that California pays  184 million a year to sustain capital punishment   or close to an accumulated  5 billion since the practice was reinstituted in 1978 In February  Mr  Newsom intervened in a high profile death row case that for years activists have claimed was a prime example of racial injustice Kevin Cooper  a black man who was convicted of four brutal murders by stabbing in 1983  has long maintained his innocence  His supporters have put forward evidence that he was framed by San Bernardino officers  Mr  Newsom ordered DNA testing in the case  something that state officials had refused to do in the past The possibility of wrongful convictions   nationally  more than 150 people on death row have been exonerated since the mid 1970s  according to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty   has also energized the opposition movement  around the country and in California Last April in California  a man who had been on death row for 25 years for murdering a young girl  a former farmworker named Vicente Figueroa Benavides  was freed after a court determined that testimony given at his trial was false Students  read the entire article  then tell us   Do you support or oppose the use of the capital punishment  Should it be abolished in the United States   Do you think the death penalty serves a necessary purpose  like deterring crime  providing relief for victims  families or imparting justice  Or is capital punishment  cruel and unusual punishment  and therefore prohibited by the Constitution   What is your reaction to Gov  Newsom s moratorium announcement  Which of his arguments for a moratorium do you find most persuasive  Which are the least   The article states But in 2016  Californians doubled down on the death penalty  approving a measure that streamlined the appeals process  which has typically taken about 25 years in California for condemned prisoners  The initiative  which was backed by many law enforcement officials and prosecutors  passed with 51 percent of the vote  belying California s national image as place where politics was steadily moving to the left  It was approved at the same time that voters legalized marijuana Do you think Mr  Newsom was right to issue a moratorium despite recent votes in support of the death penalty by California s residents  Do you think it violates the will of the state s residents  or should he follow his own conscience  Should public opinion matter in cases like capital punishment   How concerned should we be about wrongful convictions  Do you have concerns about the fair application of the death penalty  or about the possibility of the criminal justice system executing an innocent person  Do the recent cases of Kevin Cooper and Vicente Figueroa Benavides  cited in the article  affect your views Related Resources After Decades  a Death Sentence

Deap Ubhi is a restless guy  At 26  he quit his job in private equity in Northern California  where he had grown up and gone to college  and then moved to India to found Burrp   a local search site similar to Yelp  He sold the company in 2009 and along with other alums became what they called the Burrp  mafia  seeding and growing other start ups in India  Fast and is extremely straightforward   one Indian entrepreneur wrote about Mr  Ubhi in an online reference   Not for the faint of heart  After returning to the West Coast  he joined Amazon in 2014 to encourage start ups to adopt the company s cloud computing products  But in less than two years  Mr  Ubhi left to start a company that provided technology to restaurants  inspired by his family s experience running an Indian Jamaican Mexican fusion joint He then shifted his career in a new direction  taking his Silicon Valley mentality to the heart of the Washington bureaucracy  He joined a Pentagon effort to recruit techies  and turned the restaurant start up into a side hustle  He wanted to use his skills not  to make a search engine more performant  or help a box of stuff get to a customer faster  but rather towards service of the American people   Mr  Ubhi later wrote But that circuitous career has landed Mr  Ubhi  now 39  in the center of a Washington drama  The question of what roles he played inside the Pentagon  and when  is holding up one of the largest federal information technology contracts in history  It is a scuffle with an unusual mixture of tech industry rivalries  national politics and the obscure world of government procurement ImageDeap Ubhi in 2009  His short time working in the Pentagon has put him at the center of a Washington drama CreditSattish Bate Hindustan Times  via Getty ImagesThe project  a  10 billion deal to bring modern cloud computing to the Pentagon s arsenal  drew the attention of the biggest tech companies from the moment it was announced in 2017  Amazon  Microsoft  Google  IBM and Oracle all wanted the prize But it had a hitch  The contract would go to only one cloud vendor  even though many big companies prefer to work with multiple cloud providers  Amazon  the runaway leader in cloud computing  appeared to be perhaps the only company capable of fulfilling the Pentagon s huge demands  And that is where Mr  Ubhi s connections to the company  where he now works again  have thrown a wrench into the process The software giant Oracle  which is widely considered ill equipped to land the deal  has aggressively criticized the one vendor approach  As part of its opposition  the company is arguing in federal court that Mr  Ubhi s ties to Amazon shaped the contract in the company s favor Before the case was filed last year  the Pentagon found that Mr  Ubhi had no improper influence  and it continued evaluating the proposals despite Oracle s lawsuit  But in late February  the government said it had received  new information  about Mr  Ubhi that it needed to investigate  essentially delaying the process A Pentagon spokeswoman  Elissa Smith  declined to say what new information about Mr  Ubhi had been brought to the department s attention  The Pentagon had said that the winner of the contract was projected to be announced in April  But Ms  Smith said the inquiry into Mr  Ubhi was  expected to impact the award date  Mr  Ubhi  contacted through Amazon  declined to comment  as did the company Oracle also declined to comment  But in its lawsuit  Oracle has highlighted Mr  Ubhi s outspoken enthusiasm for Amazon  In early 2017  he took to Twitter to thank Jeff Bezos  the Amazon founder  for opposing President Trump s travel ban   Once an Amazonian  always an Amazonian   he wrote ImageSafra A  Catz  a co chief executive of Oracle  which has has aggressively criticized the Pentagon s approach to a giant cloud computing contract CreditKevin Hagen for The New York TimesThe comments touch on an issue floating around discussions about the contract  whether Mr  Trump would put his finger on the scale  The president s disdain for Mr  Bezos and Amazon is well documented on his Twitter feed  At a private dinner with Mr  Trump  one of Oracle s co chief executives  Safra A  Catz  discussed the contract  Bloomberg reported last year  After that report  the White House press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  said Mr  Trump was  not involved  in the contracting process By the standards of most administrations  it would be extraordinarily unusual for the president to insert himself into the competition for a government contract  But when Mr  Trump was president elect  he drew attention for taking on Boeing over the cost of a new Air Force One aircraft and pressing Lockheed Martin over the cost of the F 35 fighter jet If Mr  Trump went so far as to say  who should compete  or how one company should be evaluated compared to another  that would be a first   said David A  Drabkin  a former procurement official at the Defense Department A Defense Department procurement official is formally overseeing the cloud contract  known as the joint enterprise defense infrastructure  or JEDI  But Ms  Smith declined to identify the officials who would be involved with choosing the winner A White House official reiterated on Wednesday that the president was not involved The military has lagged behind the private sector in adopting cloud computing  but officials have made clear that they know the stakes  The Pentagon s move to the cloud has been led by the chief information officer  Dana Deasy  a former global chief

Department of DefenseAdopting technologies widely used in the private sector is key to the mission of the defense digital service  the Pentagon tech team Mr  Ubhi joined in 2016  It is unclear what Mr  Ubhi worked on during most of his time in government  But in his last two months  during fall 2017  he did market research for JEDI  according to the Pentagon In court documents  Oracle argues that Mr  Ubhi worked on JEDI when the Pentagon decided to take the approach of hiring a single cloud provider  Oracle cites internal documents in which Mr  Ubhi expressed support for a single cloud  When the Air Force awarded a different cloud project to multiple vendors  Mr  Ubhi wrote that the contract  makes me weep  Oracle says Mr  Ubhi clearly favored Amazon over other tech companies  In an online chat conversation on Slack about another cloud computing provider  he sent a closed eyes  tongue out emoji Amazon has countered that the Pentagon identified 72 people substantially involved in developing the contract and its requirements  and that Mr  Ubhi worked on JEDI for only seven weeks  in the early stages At the end of October 2017  Mr  Ubhi recused himself from JEDI  saying Amazon and his restaurant start up  Tablehero   may soon engage in further partnership discussions   Two weeks later  he resigned and then rejoined Amazon  where he still works on the commercial  not government  side of the business  the company said There is no evidence that Amazon bought Tablehero  Dheeraj Jain  an investor in Tablehero  said Mr  Ubhi has not responded to emails   We have written off this investment  unfortunately   he added   And we are not happy about it  ImageDana Deasy  the Pentagon s chief information officer  has been leading its move to the cloud CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThe Pentagon released the JEDI request for proposals nine months after Mr  Ubhi recused himself  It said a single cloud would let it move faster and with more security  a decision the Government Accountability Office later affirmed Because Amazon appeared to have a leg up  the contract immediately became a point of contention among tech contractors  Both Oracle and IBM filed protests with the Government Accountability Office  which adjudicates federal contract challenges  The office denied Oracle s protest and later rejected IBM s on procedural grounds  Oracle  whose cloud market share is small enough to be grouped in the  other  category in several leading research reports  took its fight to the United States Court of Federal Claims The delays from the Oracle lawsuit could help Microsoft  In the months since the request for proposals went out  the company  which has supplied the Pentagon for decades  has improved its capabilities to the point that some experts believe it is an increasingly credible competitor to Amazon But even if Mr  Ubhi is found to have tainted the contract  it is not clear that it would change the Pentagon s plan to use a single cloud provider  The Government Accountability Office in November found that the Pentagon s justifications  reasonably support  the decision  The office said it would be  improper  to go against what the Pentagon determined was best for the country  even if Mr  Ubhi had shaped the contract When he was working on the project  Mr  Ubhi said that bolstering national security was the point In October 2017  he wrote in a blog post that he believed his work on JEDI would  be a unique asset to help our men and women in uniform make more data driven decisions  and to allow our leadership to be more effective  Little did he know  it seems  that his work on it could put the project on pause  or  if Oracle has its way  in jeopardy

To the Editor Many Times articles and columns discuss how the Trump Fox ticket ardently hopes that 2020 will be a binary contest between socialism and capitalism freedom Rejecting that hoary choice is Senator Elizabeth Warren  Her  regulated markets  alternative instead presumes that  when competition fails to protect families  it s better to build guard rails at the top of a cliff than put ambulances below  This means not freedom to inflict harm  pollute  monopolize  but freedom from harm  climate violence  financial fraud  unsafe products  Given the corrosive surge in income inequality  Senator Warren has proposed new structural changes reminiscent of how F D R  s New Deal in the 1930s pledged  to save capitalism from itself   They include an ultramillionaires  wealth tax and a proposal to break up tech giants that are digitally stifling small businesses and economic opportunity Socialism  These bold proposals seek to expand competition and freedom  not government ownership The 2020 contest will be between democracy and piracy  Here  it s the G O P  that is extreme while Democrats are mainstream Mark GreenNew YorkThe writer was New York City s first public advocate 
This is the sixth installment in an eight part philosophical tour of the ancient city by the author  The entire series can be found here  ATHENS   Since we began our little tour I have tried to take you to some of the less obvious sites around the ancient city  often at the periphery  But now I want to head right to the center of it  the Agora  This was a large public square  humming with human activity   shopping  gossip  dramatic performances  military and religious processions   and surrounded on all sides by buildings  including many of the key institutions of Athenian democracy  Excavations since the 1930s have uncovered the Agora  an open green area  about 30 acres sloping down northwest from the rock of the Acropolis  What I most like about it is its feeling of space  the sense of absence that triggers the imagination and allows one to conjure the ruined city in the mind s eye The reason for coming here on this particular day was entirely selfish  It was my birthday and I wanted to return to my favorite site in Athens and visit the ruins of the house of the source of my name  Simon the Cobbler  He also pretended to be a philosopher of sorts We arrived close to the entrance to the Agora as it opened  A railway line  built in 1891  bisects the northern edge of the site  emitting a low  pleasant rumble  not the anxiety inducing squeal of the New York subway   The train line covers the remains of the Altar of the Twelve Gods and runs right alongside the Stoa of Attalos  rebuilt in the 1950s  which houses the small and rather lovely Agora Museum  With standard Athenian counterpoint  colonnades of bright white columns abut garish trackside graffiti  The contradictions reach further back  King Attalos of Pergamon was a student of the philosopher Carneades in the second century B C  and the presumably grateful alumnus gave his university town the gift of a shopping mall  with 42 shops in the stoa rented out by the city  Everything was for sale in the Agora It was time for a birthday breakfast  Greek yogurt and a big stack of American style pancakes soaked with honey  A very drunken Englishman  this was about 9 a m   sat just ahead of us  smoking a cigarette  and holding onto it with some difficulty  He turned around to look at us for a good long while and said to me   You re serious  aren t you   Hardly  I thought  He then started into a series of incoherent anti German  pro Brexit rants to no one in particular  The waiters seemed puzzled  but tolerated him nonetheless  Sometimes  I do miss England A group of about 100 schoolchildren were talking wildly over one another and waiting at the entrance for their bewildered teachers to buy them tickets  We slipped by them and into the site  We were standing on the Panathenaic way  the ancient processional path that led through the Agora and up to the Acropolis ImageAn inscribed stone at the side of the Panathenaic way that passes through Agora and leads to the Acropolis CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesEarly morning rain had given way to cool sunshine  Some trees were just beginning to blossom  and I buried my nose into flowers that seemed to have the scent of honey  though it could have been the remains of breakfast  But Persephone is definitely on her way back from Hades In a row running along the west side of the Agora are the footprints of the key institutions of Athenian democracy  the Metroon  the sanctuary for the mother of the gods and the city archive and records office  the Bouleuterion  where the 500 citizens chosen by lot each year to serve on the council  or boule  met every day  and the Tholos  the modest  round headquarters of the 50 strong executive committee of the council with space for at least some members to stay overnight to deal with any emergencies  Just up from these buildings was the open area of the Pnyx where the General Assembly  or ekklesia  of citizens met every 10 days to speak and to decide the law collectively Just above  on a small hill  stands the Hephaisteion  the best preserved Doric temple in Greece and  for me  the most beautiful building in Athens  Though similar to the Parthenon  it is smaller  more complete and all the more enjoyable for being slightly ignored  On a visit here last summer  we watched a tortoise slowly lumber from view into the darkness of the surrounding bushes at the back of the temple ImageHephaisteion  the temple for the god of sun and fire  Hephaestus  sits just above the Agora CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesThe boundaries of the Agora were marked with marble stones about three feet high called horoi  These defined the horizon between public and private space  preventing the encroachment of the latter into the former  Two have been recovered  and each is inscribed with the simple phrase   Horos eimi tes agoras    I am the boundary of the Agora   I find the pronoun very interesting  It is not the impersonal address of a piece of legislation  This is the boundary  trespassers keep out  Rather  the stone itself speaks On the south edge of the site  right next to a boundary stone  and therefore just outside the Agora  are the excavated ruins of a small building with a plaque that says  Oikia Simonos    the house of Simon    Legend has it that this was the home and workshop of Simon the Cobbler  a good friend of Socrates  It is said that Socrates liked to hang out in Simon s workshop and engage in discussions  free from the public glare It is ironic that Socrates might have liked to spend time with a cobbler  Socrates was famously shoeless  a habit widely imitated by some of his followers  So  whatever took place in Simon s house  it wasn t selling shoes  Also  as is clear from many of the Platonic dialogues  Socrates genuinely admired people with practical skills  Sadly  he had none himself  ImageThe base of a black glazed cup with the name Simon etched on it  It provides archaeological support for the story of Simon the Cobbler CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesThere is some archaeological support for this legend  A number of hobnails were found during excavations  along with bone eyelets used for tying laces or straps  These are on view in the museum  along with the base of a black glazed cup  or kylix  with the name Simonos scratched on to it  So  maybe the story has some truth So who was Simon The splendidly unreliable Diogenes Laertius gave Simon his own entry in his  Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers  and added that Phaedo of Elis was the author of a  genuine  dialogue called  Simon   When Socrates came into his workshop and began to talk  Simon reportedly made notes of all that he could remember  And Laertius claimed that Simon was the first   before Plato   to introduce Socratic dialogues as a form of written conversation  There were 33 of them  described as  leathern   doubtless because of Simon s occupation  Titles include  On Good Eating    On Greed  and  On Pretentiousness   Apparently  they were unpretentiously short There is another story connected with Simon that assumed significance for a more anarchic school of street philosophers who followed Socrates  the Cynics  or dog philosophers  so called because they were abusively called dogs and then took on the moniker as a badge of honor  It is said that Simon attracted the attention of Pericles  the most powerful leader of Athenian democracy in the classical period  Pericles promised to protect and support Simon if he came to work for him  But Simon refused because he preferred his parrhesia  his freedom of speech For the Cynics  only those people who achieved self sufficiency  autarkeia  or independence of mind could truly exercise their freedom of speech  For a cobbler philosopher like Simon to work for a powerful political figure like Pericles would have undermined that independence and completely compromised his freedom  Simon thus exemplifies the freedom of the Cynic  namely those who chose a life as free as possible from politics and power  who were cosmopolites  citizens of the world and not subjects to any particular city or state  And by tracing their ancestry through Simon  the Cynics could see themselves as having a direct lineage to Socrates ImageA statue of Socrates in Athens CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesPlato famously described Diogenes the Cynic as a  Socrates gone mad   But this madness is testament to a libertarianism that refused the authoritarian picture of society described in Plato s  Republic  and the  Laws   Unlike Plato and Aristotle  Diogenes did not work for tyrants  Perhaps this is why tyrants loved him  Legend has it that Diogenes was the philosopher most admired by Alexander the Great  When Alexander met Diogenes  he asked him what he wanted  Diogenes famously replied   I want you to get out of my light  I have been reading an interesting book recently called  The Tyrant s Writ  by Deborah Tarn Steiner  It is a study on the relation of writing and tyranny in antiquity  We possess the understandable prejudice that literacy and democracy somehow go together  that a literate society is best able to resist oppression  That might be so  but it overlooks the way in which tyranny and writing are often conjoined   through the writing of laws and decrees  but also the stamping of coins  huge inscriptions on columns  the elaborate architectural construction of triumphal arches  not to mention the branding of slaves   that dictatorial regimes assert and exert control  Ancient historians like Herodotus often associate writing with the behavior of  barbarian tyrants from the East   notably the Persians  as opposed to democracy  which is much more concerned with speech The historians and dramatists of the classical period repeatedly stated that a democracy depends on the ability of citizens to speak freely and declare their will out loud  As Steiner wrote   It is logos and not writing that exists at the heart of democratic Athens s self definition and the good speaker   not the writer   who keeps popular government on course   Speech is the hallmark of the democrat  and written communication and legislation repeatedly appear in the depiction of the oligarch  Contemporary political parallels are too numerous and obvious to draw  but it might be noted that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is very fond of citing law ImageThe orator s bema  the ancient speaker s podium at Pnyx CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesThe association between written law and democracy is much more problematic than one might at first imagine  Think here of the debate about the merits and demerits of a written versus an unwritten constitution  the United States versus Britain  for instance  Writing can thus be seen as opposed to liberty  as the very mechanism of enslavement  Real democracy perhaps requires no written constitution  What it needs are hard won habits of freedom of speech  persuasion  collective decision making and candor Of course  the freedom of speech by which Athens defined itself was famously betrayed by Athens itself  Socrates was charged with impiety toward the gods and corruption of the youth and summoned to face those charges in the Royal Stoa  here in the northwest corner of Agora very close to where I am standing We know Socrates  fate  What   we might wonder   is ours In our virtual Agora  where the boundary stones separating the private from the public have all been removed  and where we live in a new and unprecedented tyranny of writing  of text and texting  and where cynicism has taken on a whole new troubling set of meanings  how is that fragile parrhesia of the ancients that defines democracy to be cultivated  And how might it be sustained RelatedIn Greece  an Economic Revival Fueled by  Golden Visas  and TourismMarch 20  2019Simon Critchley is a professor

The troubled vice unit of the Columbus Division of Police  which became nationally known for its arrest of Stormy Daniels last summer and has since become the subject of a federal corruption investigation  was abolished on Tuesday  about two weeks after one of its detectives was indicted The Ohio detective  Andrew K  Mitchell  55  retired on March 13  two days after his arrest on federal charges that he kidnapped women and forced them to have sex with him  a police spokeswoman said on Wednesday  Along with Mr  Mitchell  two other officers who had been in the vice unit were officially removed from their vice assignments after previously having been placed on desk jobs  police officials said In a video posted online late Tuesday  Thomas A  Quinlan  the interim police chief  said he had also notified the seven other vice officers that he was  abolishing their assignments   adding that the vice unit was still under investigation  While today s decision is not a reflection on all the officers assigned to vice  it has become clear there s a better method of addressing the community s needs when to it comes to the enforcement of prostitution  alcohol and gambling   he said   Soon I am meeting with the deputy chiefs to develop a new model for enforcement  Following this meeting  I will share the division s plans with the community  The decision to disband the vice unit may help end a turbulent eight months for the Division of Police  which had mostly paused the vice unit s operations and at one point changed police chiefs during the investigations  With its demise  the vice group joins a list of ignominious law enforcement teams  such as the Baltimore Police Department s Gun Trace Task Force  a secret clique within the Los Angeles Sheriff s Department s elite gang unit and the Chicago Police Department s Special Operations Section  that  over the years  have been accused of wrongdoing and ensnared their institutions in scandal Mayor Andrew J  Ginther of Columbus praised Chief Quinlan s move  saying it was a recognition that the unit had  lost the public s trust   Change and reform is hard but necessary to become the best of the best   Mr  Ginther said Tuesday night on Twitter The vice unit of the Columbus Division of Police became the subject of national attention last July  when four of the unit s detectives were sent to Sirens Gentlemen s Club in northeastern Columbus to investigate complaints  alleging prostitution and drug activity   according to court documents While dancing topless  Ms  Daniels  whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  pressed patrons  faces into her chest and fondled the breasts of some women in the audience  the detectives said  in affidavits  Ms  Daniels performed similar acts on three officers  and grabbed one by the buttocks  according to the affidavits  She was then arrested and charged with three counts of illegal sexually oriented activity  a misdemeanor However  those charges were dropped in under 24 hours  because the law under which Ms  Daniels was arrested applied to people who  regularly  appear nude or seminude at a particular establishment  and Ms  Clifford had not appeared at the club consistently Still  the episode raised the possibility that the arrest of Ms  Daniels  who by that time had gained nationwide prominence for her allegations that she had had an affair with President Trump  had been politically motivated and caused some to wonder why undercover vice officers had been sent to the strip club in the first place  The police chief at the time  Kim Jacobs  quickly acknowledged that  a mistake was made  and promised to review  the motivations behind the officers  actions    An internal review later found that allegations that there had been a political motivation behind the arrest of Ms  Daniels were  not sustained   but the review did determine that the arrest was improper  Mr  Mitchell  a 31 year veteran of the Division of Police  was not one of the four detectives involved in Ms  Daniels s arrest on July 11  the police spokeswoman  Sgt  Chantay Boxill  said on Wednesday  Sergeant Boxill said the arrest was one of several episodes that drew attention to the vice unit and eventually prompted an investigation into it In August  Mr  Mitchell was investigating a prostitution complaint when he fatally shot 23 year old Donna Castleberry  the police said  According to police reports  Mr  Mitchell shot Ms  Castleberry multiple times while she was in his car after she stabbed him in the hand   An investigation into Ms  Castleberry s death is expected to go before a grand jury in April  In September  the vice unit  which at the time consisted of about 20 officers and supervisors  paused operations for a month while the division conducted an internal review of the unit  Asked at a news conference at the time whether the strip club episode involving Ms  Daniels or the fatal shooting of Ms  Castleberry had resulted in the pause  Chief Jacobs said that  everything s related to it  As the four week review period came to a close  Chief Jacobs requested that the F B I  s Public Corruption Task Force take over the review   a request the bureau accepted  The pause on the vice unit s work remained in effect  the police division said at the time Based on the F B I  s initial findings  three officers  Steven Rosser  Whitney Lancaster and Mr  Mitchell  were  at various points late last year  stripped of their guns and placed on desk duty pending the outcome of the investigation  Sergeant Boxill said on Wednesday  She added that the investigation was continuing A spokesman for the F B I  s Cincinnati field office did not immediately return a request for comment  Attempts to reach Mr  Rosser and Mr  Lancaster were not immediately successful After Chief Jacobs retired in February  Mr  Ginther appointed Mr  Quinlan as interim chief His tenure was almost immediately greeted by scandal  when  last week  federal prosecutors announced that Mr  Mitchell had been arrested on charges that he kidnapped two women under the guise of arrest and forced them to have sex with him to gain their freedom  Mr  Mitchell kidnapped one woman in July 2017 and forced her to perform oral sex on him  according to the indictment handed down by a grand jury on March 7  on two separate occasions  in September 2017 and in the summer of 2018  he forced a second woman to have sex with him  it said The indictment also said that when Mr  Mitchell learned he was being investigated  he tried to tamper with witnesses and obstruct the investigation and also lied to federal prosecutors about having sex with prostitutes His lawyer  Mark Collins  has said Mr  Mitchell denies wrongdoing and will vigorously fight the case at trial  Mr  Collins did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on Wednesday afternoon Shortly after the indictment was announced  Chief Quinlan promised that Mr  Mitchell would be  held accountable for his actions  Mr  Mitchell was charged last week with three counts of deprivation of rights under color of law  the term for a crime committed by a police officer on duty   two counts of witness tampering  one count of obstructing justice and one count of providing a false statement to federal agents  If convicted  he could face up to life in prison  Mr  Mitchell remains in custody  a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice said  and is scheduled to appear in United States District Court for an arraignment on those charges Thursday morning 
BERLIN   Germany  which had already announced that it will fall significantly short of NATO s defense spending goals  annoying the United States  risks provoking Washington further by failing to reach even its own slimmed down target Chancellor Angela Merkel s government had a falling out with the Trump administration last year when it said that  despite signing a commitment to work toward spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024  its target would instead be 1 5 percent Now  projected spending levels are expected to fall below even that lower path in a three year budget plan due to be announced on Wednesday  portending another confrontation with Washington The timing could not be worse  with NATO preparing to celebrate its 70th anniversary in Washington in April Mr  Trump s resentment toward European allies he perceives to be coasting on America s security guarantee is well known  and recent reports that Washington is considering billing allies for hosting American troops has further shaken the alliance Even in Europe  some diplomats in neighboring countries privately complain that Germany s failure to meet its commitments is putting not just its own relationship with Washington on the line  but that of the whole Continent Ms  Merkel insisted on Tuesday that her government could still hit the 1 5 percent target in budgets down the road  But few still believe her   least of all Mr  Trump s ambassador in Berlin  NATO members clearly pledged to move toward  not away  from 2 percent by 2024   Richard Grenell  the American ambassador to Germany  told reporters on Monday after budget numbers were first floated   That the German government would even be considering reducing its already unacceptable commitments to military readiness is a worrisome signal to Germany s 28 NATO allies  With Mr  Trump calling the European Union a  foe  and NATO  obsolete   trans Atlantic relations have been badly strained for some time But in recent months  the tone has become openly hostile  especially between the United States and Germany  Europe s largest economy Mr  Grenell has demanded that Berlin scrap Nord Stream 2  a planned gas pipeline from Russia  or risk possible sanctions for the companies involved  stop German companies from doing business in Iran  or risk restrictions on doing business in the United States  and ban a Chinese company from building a new communications network  or risk losing access to some intelligence sharing The threats have not gone down well in Berlin  with one German politician this week even demanding Mr  Grenell s immediate expulsion for interfering in Germany s sovereign affairs  although that is unlikely to happen  Any U S  diplomat who acts like a high commissioner of an occupying power must learn that our tolerance also knows its limits   said Wolfgang Kubicki  deputy chairman of the opposition Free Democrats The Social Democrats  Ms  Merkel s center left coalition partner  have put Mr  Trump s scowling oversize face on a campaign poster ahead of European parliamentary elections with the caption   Trump  Europe is the answer  ImageMr  Stoltenberg with the German chancellor  Angela Merkel CreditAndreas Gebert ReutersBut even some of Mr  Trump s fiercest critics say that Germany s failure to live up to its NATO spending commitments has given a hollow ring to the country s vocal defense of the international order  You can t have it both ways   said Julianne Smith  a former adviser to the Obama administration who is currently in Berlin as a senior fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy  You can t at every turn stress the importance of multilateralism and keep it as the foundation of German foreign policy   Ms  Smith said   and then renege on the commitments you ve made to multilateral institutions like the NATO alliance   I appreciate that Donald Trump has made it more difficult   she added   It s become a liability to stand shoulder to shoulder with this guy  But she and others point out that Germany had committed to moving toward the 2 percent target long before Mr  Trump s election   most memorably in 2014  shortly after Russia annexed part of Ukraine  Any German who frames this as bending to Trump s wishes is missing the broader point   Ms  Smith said of NATO s 2 percent target German officials point out that in absolute terms  German military spending has increased for five straight years  up 36 percent  and that Germany is NATO s second biggest contributor of funds and troops  They say that a fair measurement of a country s contribution to NATO should take account of wider factors  including foreign aid spending and the rate of economic growth Given the size of Germany s economy and years of consistently high economic growth  2 percent of G D P   some also argue  was a fast moving target   and one hard to meet in a short period of time But many security experts have questioned that argument  We are just not credible anymore   said Jan Techau  director of the Europe Program at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin   First we said 2 percent  but we didn t really mean it  Then we said 1 5 percent  and it turns out we didn t really mean that either  Defense spending is still on course to increase next year  rising from 1 35 percent of G D P  this year to 1 37 percent next year  finance ministry officials said  But by 2023  according to the latest budget figures  it is expected to be back at 1 25 percent The latest trans Atlantic conflict is in part rooted in Germany s domestic politics The finance minister  Olaf Scholz  who drafted the new budget plan  is a member of the Social Democrats  the center left coalition partner of Ms  Merkel s Conservatives  Ahead of a string of European and regional elections this year  the Social Democrats  whose poll ratings have plummeted in recent years  are eager to distinguish themselves by giving priority to social spending over defense Some political leaders like Michael Grosse Brömer  the conservative caucus whip  said that Parliament was expected to approve a continuation of its current military missions in Afghanistan  Mali  South Sudan and the Mediterranean  and that Germany still intended to uphold its spending commitments to its NATO partners  But he  too  conceded that  the current plan looks somewhat different  One wild card is economic growth  which is set to slow in coming years  making it easier to increase defense spending as a percentage of G D P  The German Council of Economic Experts scaled down its growth forecast for the current and coming years to 0 8 percent and 1 7 percent  respectively  saying that  the boom years are over  But it is time for Germany to look beyond electoral horizons and consider defense spending in a longer term  strategic framework  said Ms  Smith  the former Obama adviser  Imagine Trump left NATO tomorrow   she said   Imagine the investment Germany would have to make in its own and Europe s security then   This is the cheap version   she said of the current NATO spending targets 
Youth turnout in the November 2018 election was by the far the highest it s been in a midterm election in the last 25 years  and probably ever  That record high was   31 percent  That means that nearly 70 percent of eligible voters under 30 stayed home  That s at least better than the 80 percent who stayed home in previous midterms Here s another statistic  Young people support Democratic candidates by a 2 to 1 margin They just don t bother to vote their choices  If the Democrats can change that  they ll win more elections Earlier in Fixes  I wrote about what the United States could do to raise voter turnout  make voter registration automatic  hold elections on Sundays   things almost every mature democracy does A healthy democracy needs more participation in general  Winning elections  however  requires candidates to identify  mobilize and turn out their own supporters  There are a lot of new technological tools to do this  But one important innovation doesn t require technology  It s based on a strategy that s not new at all  It relies on the most powerful motivator of youth  friends Here s an example  In 2014  Sangeeth Peruri decided to run for the school board in his hometown Los Altos  Calif  He was active in his son s school   his daughter was a toddler   and on school district committees  Mr  Peruri had been an investment manager and was a pretty good amateur athlete  he competed to get on Season 6 of the televised competition American Ninja Warrior  Here s the  video he made when applying to compete in the seventh season  In his race for the school board  two other candidates were from a local charter school that was in a land dispute with the neighborhood schools  A statewide political action committee  the California Charter School Association  poured money into the race  The two pro charter candidates spent about  100 000   in a school district with about 30 000 voters  Mr  Peruri said he spent about  4 000  plus filing fees The race was ugly  Mr  Peruri said that someone wrote letters  mostly anonymous  to the local papers and to his endorsers and major supporters  insinuating a falsehood  that he had been connected with insider trading in his former job  Some of his supporters  concerned  asked him to retire from the campaign   It was a traumatic experience   he said   Just reliving it gives me the chills  Campaigning became impossible   Phone calls and door to door didn t work any more   he said   People didn t know whether to trust you or the rumors  The turning point came when a woman came up to him and told him he had her vote   What convinced you   he asked   Coach K told me to vote for you   she said Coach K led a math competition team that a large number of young students had joined   It struck me that if I m going to win this race  I have to find the Coach Ks   Mr  Peruri said  He mapped out the town s schools  churches  sports programs and civic groups  identifying their leaders  He met them  talked to them and asked them to talk to their friends  He found residents who would invite him to neighborhood block parties and introduce him around   I looked for any group that had strong ties in the community   he said Mr  Peruri won  and served as president of the school board That  of course  is how local campaigns used to work  candidates won votes by having personal conversations with real people But it isn t any more  Now candidates spend their time on the phone with rich people  raising money so they can buy television and Facebook ads   often ads that seek to mobilize voters by getting them angry  ads that polarize and degrade civic life  Organizing is often done by volunteers contacting people they don t know   I ve found it really peculiar that everything we do in campaigns is stranger to stranger outreach   Mr  Peruri said How can we replicate Coach K for the modern world  Mr  Peruri is trying to do that  He created a program called VoterCircle  one of several new apps and strategies to get people to encourage friends to vote  This very old idea has a new  fancy name    relational organizing   What s new is the debut of software that allows campaigns to do this strategically and track the results   The new tools enable campaigns to make these asks of organizers more targeted and more integrated into their organizing program   said Tara McGowan  founder and chief executive of Acronym  an organization that builds digital tools for progressive candidates We know that when people are unsure of something  they rely on advice from friends  The most dramatic proof that this applies to voting comes from a Facebook experiment on Election Day 2010 involving 61 million people  It found that a message at the top of their feeds with voting information and an  I Voted  button only brought results  including an actual increase in voting  if it contained pictures of people s Facebook friends who had voted  Absent this peer proof  information about voting didn t work  The study also looked at those Facebook users  friends and found a contagion effect   but only among close friends So far  the new relational organizing tools are used mostly by Democrats  But Republicans will catch up   The Democratic Party has always been the party of organizing   Ms  McGowan said   Republicans rely more on messaging and communications  and they are more sophisticated about it in a lot of ways   Friend to friend organizing works particularly well with the Democratic electorate  which is heavy on young people and minorities One app is for citizens  of either party   not campaigns  VoteWithMe crosses your phone contacts with voter registries  It can tell which friends live in swing districts   and whether they voted  but not how they voted  of course  in the last few elections  This gives you a list of the highest impact potential voters to nudge  however you wish What might help make VoteWithMe effective is the shame factor  Many people are startled to know that their friends can see whether they voted   and that s an incentive to vote OutVote is a bit more formal  You use the app to join progressive campaigns and advocacy on issues that you choose   The app is free to volunteers but charges the campaigns and organizations   At the campaign s request  you ask your friends to show up at events  donate  vote and do other tasks  In that way  the app turns volunteers into mini organizers Mr  Peruri s VoterCircle is a tool for campaigns   it s free for small campaigns  but charges bigger ones  Campaigns ask volunteers to download VoterCircle  which compares their email and phone contact lists with the voter registry  creating a list of people eligible to support the candidate  It gives volunteers a message that they can personalize and text or email to their friends  The program tracks who has been contacted and how they responded No one advocates using only relational organizing  it s one strategy among many  And like anything new  it has issues   Acronym has done detailed analyses of these and other digital political tools   The biggest dig is it s really effective for a small group  but it doesn t scale   said Jessica Alter  co founder of Tech for Campaigns  which provides expert tech volunteers to progressive campaigns  Other issues  new software can be buggy  and if it s hard to use  volunteers won t download and use the programs  And they re only as good as the data they rely on  That s problematic  Voter rolls  for example  have only addresses  but people s contact lists usually have only phone numbers and emails   If they re common names  we have the user specify which voter is their friend   Mr  Peruri said   We have algorithms to improve the matching  But it s never perfect  What about the Coach Ks  To find what VoterCircle calls  super influencers   the program maps out contact networks and identifies people at the center of the densest nodes   people who could influence hundreds of voters  It tells the campaign which supporters know that person  So the candidate can meet Coach K through a friend   no cold calling Mr  Peruri said that about 2 000 progressive campaigns and organizations have used VoterCircle since 2016  A researcher looked at the effects in one election  a mail only special election for a school tax in Menlo Park  Calif  Getting a VoterCircle email from a friend was associated with at least a 25 percent greater likelihood of voting   an enormous effect  But this was a small sample  not a randomized trial  and the kind of election where such a program is most effective  one where people have little information and few turn out Vote Tripling is very new   used in only a handful of campaigns last year   and something different  It s not software  it s an idea  Campaigns normally ask supporters to pledge to vote  The Vote Tripling strategy asks them instead to pledge to remind three friends to vote It works like this  Campaigns ask their supporters to choose three friends they will remind to vote  and to tell the campaigns their first names  On the day before Election Day  the campaign goes back to supporters   by text  phone call or in person   and reminds them that they pledged to nudge Joe  Jane and Harriet to vote The number three is important  Too much choice is overwhelming  said Robert Reynolds  a behavioral scientist who devised Vote Tripling   If you ask people to get 10 friends to vote  they ll get zero   he said   If you ask them to get three  they ll get three   It s also crucial to get people to choose in advance the friends who need nudges   This decision of which friends they will mobilize is sufficiently hard that people will procrastinate   he said There are only bits of evidence so far that Vote Tripling works   nonpublished preliminary results of one randomized control trial found that friends contacted by vote triplers were twice as likely to vote  But Mr  Reynolds argues that there s no reason not to try it  A non activist might not download an organizing app  but she ll gladly ask three friends to vote   Non activists are actually more effective at mobilizing others than activists are   It s free  and there s no opportunity cost  It treats people as leaders   less patronizing than asking them to commit to vote  He said one campaign got 3 000 people to take a vote tripling pledge in two hours Mr  Reynolds supports Democrats  but he s happy to have Republicans use Vote Tripling  because he thinks it s good for the political system  Friend to friend organizing isn t just a way to raise turnout  It could be a way to democratize democracy   to push candidates a little bit out of rooms with rich people into rooms with neighborhood leaders and to help ordinary people understand and use their influence  With their friends  Mr  Reynolds said   I m just some random dude  But you  sir or ma am  you are powerful  Tina Rosenberg won a Pulitzer Prize

MCALLEN  Tex    Border Patrol detention centers in Texas s Rio Grande Valley have soared well past their capacity in recent days  prompting mass releases of migrants onto the streets as local leaders scramble to house and feed hundreds of new arrivals daily  They re as stressed as we are   Jim Darling  mayor of the South Texas border city of McAllen  said of Border Patrol officials  The officials have released more than 2 200 people from government processing facilities in the Rio Grande Valley since Monday  setting aside once again the Trump administration s vow to end what it calls  catch and release  of those who cross the border without authorization  We re trying to determine how many sites we have to have  The last thing we want is people walking our streets and having to sleep in doorways   Mr  Darling said The primary migrant services facility in the region  a former nursing home in McAllen now used by Catholic Charities as an immigrant respite center  is already reaching capacity  with nearly every inch of the low slung red brick building occupied  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border   a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  The air was thick with the smell of sweat Tuesday evening  with dozens of people waiting for assistance at the front of the building  Two government buses pulled up outside to drop off even more  54 in one bus and 57 in the second  On Wednesday  migrants slept on blue padded mats on the floors of small crowded rooms as they waited for rides to the downtown bus station In El Paso  the sudden release of about 150 migrants on Tuesday set in motion a flurry to try to accommodate them  A network of shelters run by the nonprofit Annunciation House had no more space  so city officials converted a public park into a staging area  until space for the migrants was found at local hotels Unauthorized border crossings have spiked in recent months  with more than 76 000 migrants apprehended on the southwest border in February  an 11 year high  Processing facilities in El Paso and in the Rio Grande Valley region in South Texas have swelled with migrant families in recent days  Early Tuesday  Border Patrol agents at the border fence in El Paso apprehended a group of 194 men  women and children traveling together  About five minutes later  agents in another part of the city took in a second group of 252 migrants Last week  agents in the McAllen area encountered a group of nearly 300 migrants walking toward a river levee  the largest such group seen this year  In a single 24 hour period  agents in that region had apprehended more than 1 000 migrants  most of them voluntarily turning themselves in and seeking protection under asylum laws ImageMigrants with a Border Patrol agent in El Paso  The release of about 150 migrants on Tuesday prompted the city to convert a park into a staging area CreditLucy Nicholson ReutersThe unusually large numbers are what caused agents in the Border Patrol s Rio Grande Valley sector this week to release some migrant families at an early stage  the agency said  The releases bypassed the usual procedure in which newly arrived migrants are handed over after initial processing to another federal agency  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  which may detain them or release them with some requirement that they will show up for future court appearances Instead  migrants traveling in families are being released directly by Customs and Border Protection  the Border Patrol s parent agency  after being given papers instructing them to show up at a later date in immigration court  Local officials were told that Border Patrol facilities in the area were over capacity by about 2 100 migrants The Border Patrol said in a statement that the recent increase in apprehensions led to a  limited availability of space  at the agency s facilities in the Rio Grande Valley sector  Out of concern for the safety of officers and migrants  the agency said it had begun to release families after giving them a notice to appear in immigration court  R G V  Sector will continue to coordinate with state and local stakeholders and nongovernmental organizations while these temporary measures are in place   the agency said The recent releases resembled a similar series of unannounced mass releases of migrants late last year in El Paso and San Diego  This time  however  federal immigration agencies appeared to be coordinating more closely with local officials  who in December had been caught off guard The mass release in McAllen has caused a ripple effect along the Texas border  Officials in Brownsville  60 miles east of McAllen  were told by Border Patrol officials to expect releases there in the coming days as well  It appeared that the Border Patrol intended to ease pressure on the McAllen shelter network by putting migrants on buses and dropping them off in Brownsville Tony Martinez  the mayor of Brownsville  said the city was prepared to open the downtown bus station for 24 hours to accommodate migrants  After their release  many migrants board buses to join their relatives already living elsewhere in the United States  At this particular point  we are having meetings on a daily basis so that we can monitor the numbers   Mr  Martinez said The scramble comes as Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  was scheduled to visit McAllen on Thursday  Some immigrant advocates and elected officials were skeptical of the timing of the releases  suggesting they were part of a Trump administration effort to justify the president s descriptions of a border in crisis and his declaration of a national emergency  Border Patrol officials deny such claims Representative Vicente Gonzalez  a Texas Democrat whose district includes McAllen  criticized the mass release of migrants  without processing  without proper plans for housing and with no course of reasonable action  and questioned the administration s motives  President Trump  Secretary Nielsen  and the entire administration have been presented with the truth   there is no crisis on the U S  Mexico border   he said in the statement   Their response  Create one  ImageMigrant families after being released in November  Border crossings have spiked  swelling processing facilities in El Paso and in the Rio Grande Valley CreditJohn Moore Getty ImagesThe nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project  which has been conducting legal interviews with migrants released from Border Patrol custody in the Rio Grande Valley  said it appeared that the government was deliberately releasing them hundreds at a time  Some of those released recently reported that they had been detained for up to eight days  the group said  Normally  Customs and Border Protection holds newly detained migrants for about 72 hours Also raising suspicion was a recent drop in the number of migrants prosecuted for illegal border crossings at the federal courthouse in McAllen  Prosecutions during January and February ranged from about 400 to 700 per week  But the number of migrants brought to the courthouse dropped sharply last week  with only 176 prosecuted  and 88 had been charged during the first three days of this week  even though overall apprehensions remained high  Families should never be detained  but this practice must be met with skepticism   Astrid Dominguez of the American Civil Liberties Union s Border Rights Center said in a statement On Tuesday  Sister Norma Pimentel  the executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley  posted an urgent plea for assistance on Facebook  asking for volunteers in both McAllen and Brownsville  as well chicken and vegetables to make soup  and cereal and bananas for breakfast Sister Pimentel later stood outside the respite center in a light rain to help newly arrived migrants off a bus  The respite center received more than 800 migrants on Monday  another 800 on Tuesday and more than 600 by Wednesday afternoon  Sister Pimentel said she was told by Border Patrol to expect up to 800 a day for an unspecified amount of time  In recent months  the most that Catholic Charities had assisted in one day was about 400  It s not typical at all   she said amid a crowd of migrants in the front lobby   We were not expecting this  The numbers are very high  They just simply said they re apprehending big numbers and they re over capacity  and they need to create the space for those that are just arriving  She said city officials had identified two additional sites that can be used to house migrants if the numbers warrant  If those are not enough  the group plans to charter buses to Houston and possibly San Antonio  she said As crowded as the respite center was  the conditions in the Border Patrol facilities were even more congested  some migrants who had just been released said  There were so many people   said Albertina  a 29 year old Honduran mother who had just left the central processing center in McAllen  Albertina  who asked to be identified only by her first name  stood in line at the respite center holding her infant daughter  and said she was going to take a bus to join her family in Tennessee A 45 year old man from Honduras who identified himself as David said he had arrived with his 15 year old son at a Border Patrol facility on Saturday  It was packed  he said  Two thousand   he called out to a friend   What do you think   Yes  must have been   the friend said

SAN FRANCISCO   My favorite new social network doesn t incessantly spam me with notifications  When I post  I m not bombarded with  mentions from bots and trolls  And after I use it  I don t worry about ads following me around the web That s because my new social network is an email newsletter  Every week or so  I blast it out to a few thousand people who have signed up to read my musings  Some of them email back  occasionally leading to a thoughtful conversation  It s still early in the experiment  but I think I love it The newsletter is not a new phenomenon  But there is a growing interest among those who are disenchanted with social media in what the writer Craig Mod has called  the world s oldest networked publishing platform   For us  the inbox is becoming a more attractive medium than the news feed The shift toward newsletters is part of a broader change  For years  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  asked us to live in a more  open and connected  version of the world  And billions of us did  posting status updates  photos and videos on the social network and flocking to other services like Twitter  where I post regular messages about my mood  personified in photos of my dog Now  more of us are moving toward private modes of sharing  a Slack group instead of a tweet  an encrypted Signal message instead of a status update Even the titans of public sharing have recognized the shift  In early March  Mr  Zuckerberg said that Facebook would focus on private conversations rather than public posts in the future For me  the change has happened slowly but the reasons for it were unmistakable  Every time I was on Twitter  I felt worse  I worried about being too connected to my phone  too wrapped up in the latest Twitter dunks  A colleague created his own digital detox program to reduce his smartphone addiction  I reckon he made the right choice Now  when I feel the urge to tweet an idea that I think is worth expounding on  I save it for my newsletter  The Dump  an accurate description of what spills out of my head   It s much more fun than mediating political fights between relatives on my Facebook page or decoding the latest Twitter dust up ImageThe inbox  instead of the News Feed  is becoming a more attractive medium A new crop of start ups like Substack and Revue has emerged to cater to this desire to make direct connections with others online without the noise that comes with Twitter or Facebook feeds  They do it by making it easy to start a newsletter  offering dead simple writing programs and insights into what s getting read   I use Substack  and I tend to find out immediately when my writing is terrible  either via the company s analytics system or from reader emails urging me to stop being weird  Christopher Best  Substack s chief executive  said the company s creation was driven by feelings like the ones I was having   We felt this growing sense of despair in traditional social media   he said   Twitter  Facebook  etc    they ve all incentivized certain negative patterns  What firms like Substack and Revue make possible is more personal than the wave of newsletters that emerged in the early 2000s from companies like Daily Candy  Flavorpill  Nonsense NYC and Oh My Rockness  Those brands mostly blasted lifestyle content out to the masses  targeting city residents with disposable income and attracting millions of dollars in venture capital  said Naveen Selvadurai  an entrepreneur and partner at the start up incubator Expa More recently  media start ups like The Skimm  a daily newsletter started by two former NBC producers  have grown from dozens of readers to millions   The New York Times is a minority investor in The Skimm   Axios has tapped into the newsletter market with a focus on politics and business  Other big media companies   Vox  BuzzFeed  CNN   have latched on to the trend as they seek a deeper bond with readers Newsletters could be a more reliable means of increasing readership for major publishers whose relationships with social networks have soured  Remember when Facebook moved away from promoting videos on the platform  Or when it decided to show more posts from friends and family  and de emphasize content from publishers and brands  With every shift  big media companies had to adjust  Publishers have learned the hard way that traffic from social media is too volatile   said Martijn de Kuijper  Revue s chief executive For me  a guy writing dispatches from home in his pajamas  email offers a more personal connection between writer and audience  Since beginning The Dump  I ve traded emails with people who might have followed me on Twitter but felt more comfortable talking with me one on one That direct connection creates a sense of loyalty between writer and reader that can be difficult to achieve on websites or social networks  Establishing such a bond  Mr  de Kuijper said  increases the likelihood that people will read you what you have to say Most enticing of all  I own my audience for The Dump  which I created using tools from Substack  And in contrast to what happens if I quit Facebook or Twitter  I can keep my fans   an ample email subscriber list   if I decide to leave Substack s service ImageMike Isaac calls his newsletter  The Dump   which he says is an accurate description of what spills out of his head  You don t have to fight an algorithm to reach your audience   Casey Newton  a journalist who writes The Interface  a daily newsletter for the technology news site The Verge  told me   With newsletters  we can rebuild all of the direct connections to people we lost when the social web came along  It can be more than just a creative endeavor  Newsletters can make a fine one person business  Writers can charge readers to a monthly fee for their newsletters  Substack takes a cut of that fee  Revue charges writers using a tiered pricing system based on the size of newsletter s subscriber base Luke O Neil  an independent writer  charges  6 66 a month for a subscription to his widely read  offbeat newsletter   Welcome to Hell World   He has 4 000 subscribers  700 of whom pay for his regular dispatches  I want to be myself  which is weird  angry and aggressively depressed   Mr  O Neil told me   It turns out  there are enough people out there who also like the same things I do  With a little luck  it just might work  My newsletter is free and I may never charge for it  it is  after all  an experiment and I have a job at The Times   But it could help me promote my other work  like  a book I m completing or my Times articles Using this method of private sharing is already affecting the way I post things publicly  Since January  I have consistently tweeted 15 to 30 percent less each week than I did the week before  according to Twitter s summaries of my account activity  some of my followers may be grateful   I m also using my smartphone less To be clear  I don t intend to give up my low grade Twitter addiction  I have built meaningful friendships on the platform  and it s been a pathway for people to discover my work But perhaps next time I want to muse on something more nuanced  I won t immediately blurt it out to the Twitter verse  only to be lost in a sea of other tweets  or to have Twitter make money off my ideas by sandwiching it between ads Instead  I ll save it for my newsletter following   the one that belongs to me

BANGKOK   A Cambodian court has issued arrest warrants for eight opposition leaders who fled abroad for safety but say they are now trying to return The indictment in recent days by a government controlled court in Phnom Penh  the capital  was the latest effort by Prime Minister Hun Sen to sideline opposition politicians and independent news outlets as he tries to maintain his 34 year grip on power Warrants were issued for Sam Rainsy  a founder of the Cambodia National Rescue Party  which has been dissolved  two of the party s vice presidents  Mu Sochua and Eng Chhai Eang  and five other party members They were charged with incitement to commit a felony and plotting to commit treason  charges they say are without merit The eight opposition figures fled the country in 2017  fearing arrest during a crackdown on their party  and they say that if they returned now they would be subject to detention under the new warrants  Hun Sen wants to keep full ownership of Cambodia for himself and his family   Ms  Mu Sochua said in an email message from an undisclosed location   Arrest warrants on top opposition leaders in exile proves even more that Hun Sen has full use of the judiciary   Returning home from exile is to be with the people and to restore hope for Cambodia to move forwards to positive change   she added The Cambodia National Rescue Party had been the main challenger to Mr  Hun Sen  but it was shuttered by the Supreme Court in 2017  effectively turning the country into a one party state  In the last parliamentary election  in July 2018  Mr  Hun Sen s Cambodian People s Party claimed all 125 seats Mr  Hun Sen has also cracked down on the independent news media  most significantly by forcing the closing of The Cambodia Daily  whose formation in 1993 had been a signal of the country s turn toward openness and democratic rule For the past two decades  he has been rolling back democratic standards put in place by the United Nations in the early 1990s  clipping the wings of nongovernmental organizations and human rights groups  Under Hun Sen  it s a crime to be an opposition politician inside Cambodia   said Brad Adams  executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch   Even though he dissolved the opposition and took every seat in last year s sham election  now Hun Sen wants to make it a crime to oppose the government from halfway around the world  It looks like an unpopular dictator is hitting the panic button  In September 2017  with elections approaching  more than 100 police officers were sent to arrest Kem Sokha  who had founded the Cambodia National Rescue Party with Mr  Sam Rainsy five years earlier and was its president at the time of his detention Mr  Kem Sokha was accused of colluding with the United States to overthrow the government  the party was dissolved two months later  Over 100 party members have been barred from politics  and  facing similar charges  many of them fled overseas Mr  Kem Sokha was jailed for more than a year before being released on bail in September on the condition that he not travel more than a block from his home in Phnom Penh In a statement issued after the indictments  Mr  Sam Rainsy called on the European Union to continue pressing for a return to democracy in Cambodia  A delegation from the bloc is due to visit Cambodia this week to assess its human rights record In particular  Mr  Sam Rainsy said  the European Union should push for the unfettered freedom of Mr  Kem Sokha and for the reinstatement of the Cambodia National Rescue Party  which he called  the only credible opposition party  
A Florida House panel this week approved a bill that would require former felons to pay fees and fines before having their voting rights restored  prompting criticism from those who say it would undermine a new amendment that allows more than a million former felons to vote again Supporters of the bill  approved by the Republican controlled House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice on Tuesday  contend that it is meant merely to resolve questions over how to put Amendment 4  which voters approved in November  into practice But voting rights advocates say the bill would unfairly punish those who are unable to pay and undermine the central objective of the amendment  ending permanent disenfranchisement  This bill is just flying directly in the face of what two thirds of Florida voters said very clearly   said Sean Morales Doyle  a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York Since the amendment took effect in January  it has caused some confusion  It did not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses  and questions arose about which crimes should be counted in those categories More contentious is the financial issue  Would felons be required to pay up for their sentence to be pronounced  completed  The bill  which would also clarify the relevant offenses  passed the subcommittee by a vote of 10 to 5   split along party lines  with the Democrats opposed The financial question led a Democratic opponent of the bill  Representative Adam Hattersley  to label it  blatantly unconstitutional as a poll tax   a reference to the fees used to keep African Americans from voting in the South starting in the 1890s   African Americans are disproportionately affected by felony disenfranchisement  though the majority of Floridians with felony convictions are white  Representative James Grant  a Republican and the subcommittee s chairman  who sponsored the bill  disputed that characterization  saying it  diminishes the atrocity of what a poll tax actually was   The Miami Herald reported  Mr  Grant did not immediately return a call for comment on Wednesday Mr  Grant has said that the goal of the bill is to establish a uniform set of criteria to determine who is legally eligible to vote  and that the language reflects what lawyers said while explaining the ballot question language to the state s Supreme Court Politico reported Tuesday that the measure was expected to move easily through the House  and that the Senate was preparing its own bill containing  guidance  on how the amendment should be put into effect  Both chambers are controlled by Republicans  Gov  Ron DeSantis  also a Republican  opposed the amendment and has voiced support for legislation on its implementation The Florida Rights Restoration Coalition  which led the fight for the amendment  said it opposed the bill because it would broaden the definition of  completion of sentence  beyond what was previously established by the state s Clemency Board  among other concerns VideoVoters in Florida approved an amendment to the state constitution that would restore voting rights to as many as 1 5 million former felons CreditCreditScott McIntyre for The New York Times We are hopeful that improvements can be made to this bill that secure bipartisan support before it moves to the next committee   Desmond Meade  president of the coalition  said in a statement  Amendment 4 passed with broad support from people all over the state and from all walks of life   he sad   Any legislation proposed should neither limit the rights created by Amendment 4 nor infringe upon the will of Florida voters  The matter is especially pernicious in Florida because of the state s rigid rules on fines and fees  said Ashley Thomas  the Florida director of the nonprofit Fines and Fees Justice Center Almost no waivers are granted to the indigent  she said  Fines and fees can rise quickly with late penalties  and can be sent to private collection agencies that add their own hefty surcharges  A 2010 report by the Brennan Center on the Florida court system s reliance on fees noted that observers had coined a term for it   cash register justice  Julie Ebenstein  a lawyer with the Voting Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union  criticized the bill as  truly untethered to the text of the amendment   What this will do  in effect  is disenfranchise people who can t afford to pay all of these obligations   she said Both the Brennan Center and the A C L U  acted as consultants to the coalition in drafting Amendment 4  they said Phil Telfeyan  executive director of the nonprofit Equal Justice Under Law  which focuses on economic discrimination  said his organization was considering filing a lawsuit challenging the Florida bill People who have recently been released from prison often already face considerable financial challenges  having been out of the work force and having to rebuild their lives  he noted  The Legislature is essentially punishing poverty   Mr  Telfeyan said 
LONDON   To the casual observer  Britain   an island nation that s no stranger to rain   could not get much wetter But  as it turns out  that s a fallacy  And if preventive steps are not taken  in less than three decades  Britain might run out of water  the chief executive of the Environment Agency  a public body responsible for conservation in England  said on Tuesday  On the present projections  many parts of our country will face significant water deficits by 2050  particularly in the southeast  where much of the U K  population lives   the agency chief  James Bevan  said at a conference on water use In about 20 to 25 years  demand could close in on supply in what Mr  Bevan called  the jaws of death   the point at which  unless we take action to change things  we will not have enough water to supply our needs  The reasons  he said  were climate change and population growth  And he called for a change of attitude toward water conservation to help tackle the problem  We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea   Mr  Bevan said Many in Britain  citing the often rainy weather and expressing frustration with the infamously high levels of leakage from underground pipes  tend to belittle warnings about water shortages But climate change means that Britain  will have hotter and drier summers   Mr  Bevan said  Last summer  the country was hit with weeks of unusual heat and unusually dry weather In the future  the changed conditions could amount to a 10 to 15 percent decline in the available water  and rainfall will probably become less predictable  creating a higher risk of drought  At the same time  Britain s population is expected to rise by eight million in the next three decades  to 75 million in 2050  from about 67 million now ImageHyde Park in London during a heatwave last year  when Britain was hit with weeks of unusual heat and unusually dry weather CreditDaniel Leal Olivas Agence France Presse   Getty Images Climate change plus growth equals an existential threat   Mr  Bevan said To avoid severe water shortages  he added  demand would have to be reduced   by taking measures like cutting down on leakage  increasing metering  having sustainable drainage systems and cutting down personal use   and the supply would have to be expanded  We can increase supply by a mix of methods  all of which we ll need to pursue   Mr  Bevan said  Those include building more desalination plants  transferring water from surplus to deficit areas and building reservoirs  he added  The last reservoir built in Britain is several decades old  he pointed out Michael Roberts  chief executive of Water UK  an organization that represents British water companies  agreed that multiple steps needed to be taken  A twin track approach is the right way to go  reducing demand for water at the same time as increasing supply to deal with the challenges of growth on the one hand and climate change on the other   he said in a statement Tuesday Mr  Roberts added that  water companies have publicly committed to cut leakage by 50 percent by 2050  and underlined the need for the government  industry and regulators to work together Tony Allan  a water expert and emeritus professor of geography at King s College London  said that the political issue of supply was so emotional in Britain that  it s a place where we have the option not to have a water meter   Only droughts get people to think we have a problem and approve some changes   he said in a phone interview on Tuesday The biggest problems would most likely be in southern England  Professor Allan said  adding that  there will always be excess water in the north of England   And he said the situation in Britain would probably not be as serious as it is likely to become in places like Israel or Singapore Nonetheless  the issue is complicated  Professor Allan said  Domestic and industrial consumption is a relatively small part of the picture  he explained  with the water needed for agriculture perhaps being of greater concern But  he said of Mr  Bevan s comments   At least he s moved the topic up the agenda  
TOKYO   The head of Japan s Olympic Committee said on Tuesday that he would step down at the end of his term this summer   a decision that comes as he faces a French corruption investigation into how Tokyo was chosen to host next year s Summer Games The committee s president  Tsunekazu Takeda  has said that he is innocent  But the allegations have mired the games in scandal  further damaging the credibility of the Olympics bidding process and casting a shadow over what the Japanese government had hoped would be a showcase for the country s revival Speaking at a news conference Tuesday afternoon  Mr  Takeda said he planned to resign in late June  at the end of his 10th term as president of the committee  to make room for a new generation of Olympic leadership  He will also resign his position on the International Olympic Committee  It s very painful for me to think that I have made such an uproar in society   he said  but he added   I have done nothing wrong  and moving forward  I want to make efforts to prove my innocence  French investigators in December indicted Mr  Takeda   a former Olympic equestrian who is also chairman of the International Olympic Committee s marketing commission   as part of a criminal investigation into the awarding of the games  which Tokyo won during a 2013 meeting of the Olympic committee in Buenos Aires  Mr  Takeda has said he was questioned by the French authorities  but denied their accusations He has had no further contact with investigators  he told reporters on Tuesday Prosecutors in France suspect that the process of Tokyo s win was tainted  They say that hopeful officials representing potential host cities paid bribes to African Olympic committee members to win support  Payments in connection with the process to Papa Massata Diack  a former marketing official from the International Association of Athletics Federations  first raised suspicions among French prosecutors about the decision The French authorities had previously sought to extradite Mr  Diack from his home in Senegal on charges that he helped manipulate the awarding of the 2016 Summer Olympics to Rio de Janeiro  Mr  Diack has said that racism and jealousy are behind the allegations In 2016  French prosecutors said that the Tokyo bidding committee had made more than  2 million in payments to Black Tidings  a Singaporean company run by a close friend of Mr  Diack s  The Japanese authorities have since questioned Mr  Takeda about his role in the payments and concluded that they were for consulting work  The Japanese Olympic Committee maintains the payments were legitimate The Tokyo event will be the city s second time hosting the Summer Games and the country s fourth games over all  following winter events in Sapporo and Nagano Just as the 1964 Tokyo Olympics were intended to show the world that Japan had arrived as an economic power after its near destruction in World War II  the 2020 Summer Games were supposed to be an opportunity to demonstrate the country s recovery from decades of economic stagnation and 2011 s catastrophic earthquake and nuclear disaster  Tokyo beat out Madrid and Istanbul to host the Summer Games Since then  Japan has seen a surge of tourism and a stretch of inconsistent but largely positive economic growth  and the event s boosters say the Games deserve some of the credit  It was also seen as a major political win for Japan s prime minister  Shinzo Abe  who appeared at the closing ceremony of the Rio Games dressed as Super Mario  the red hatted  overalls clad character from the Nintendo video games But the road to the Olympics has not been a smooth one  Budget overruns have raised questions about the event s economic benefits  And while officials have tried to link the Games to the reconstruction of Fukushima Prefecture  where the 2011 earthquake unleashed disaster at a nuclear power plant  that connection has served only to highlight the slow and difficult cleanup work that continues 
AMMAN  Jordan   For the last half century the politics of the Middle East has been shaped by five key pillars  but all five are now crumbling  A new Middle East is aborning   but not necessarily the flourishing one that people imagined in the 1990s  This one is being shaped more by Twitter memes than by U S  diplomats  more by unemployment than by terrorism  more by upheavals on the streets than by leaders in palaces  more by women than by men  Can t say where it will all settle out  but for now  beware falling pillars How so  For starters  there was always a deep U S  involvement in shaping the future of this region  But just look around today  The U S  doesn t even have ambassadors in Egypt  Turkey  Iraq  the United Arab Emirates  Jordan or Saudi Arabia  and the U S  ambassador to Israel  a former Trump bankruptcy lawyer  is so enthralled with the right wing Jewish settler movement that he is more a propagandist than a diplomat  Bye bye American pie Second  there has always been some kind of Israeli Palestinian peace process pushing for the best two state solution  Again  bye bye  Today  in truth  the U S  and Israel seem to be engaged in a search for the best one state solution  meaning permanent Israeli security control over the West Bank and East Jerusalem  along with some form of deep Palestinian autonomy Third  Arab governments could always guarantee jobs for their populations in their bureaucracies or security services   jobs where you could come late  leave early and work another job on the side  Also  bye bye  With falling oil prices and rising populations  virtually every Arab state today is trying to figure out how to shed government workers and outsource services Jordan s King Abdullah recently told a group of U S  military visitors that what keeps him up at night is just one thing   and it s not ISIS or Al Qaeda  It s the fact that 300 000 Jordanians are unemployed and 87 percent of them are between the ages of 18 and 39  prime working years ImageKing Abdullah of Jordan during a visit to Washington last week CreditMandel Ngan Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesFor weeks there have been sit ins by jobless students outside Abdullah s palace and protest marches across Jordan by the unemployed  hungry and hopeless  At the same time  the unemployed in Gaza last week began a  revolt of the hungry  against Hamas s economic mismanagement  and similar street protests erupted in Algeria and Sudan  aimed at their failing  long entrenched autocrats  Arab Spring 2 0 anyone The fourth crumbling pillar  The days when information flowed only from the top down  and Arab governments could control the voices in their countries  are long gone  With Twitter  Facebook and WhatsApp widely diffused in the Arab world  information now moves horizontally and people   using their real names   now tweet the most insulting things at their leaders  It is increasingly obvious that social networks and cyber tools are making efficient autocrats  like China  even more efficient  But they seem to be making soft authoritarians  like Jordan  more fragile  and they are making Western democracies increasingly ungovernable  Finally  men could dominate women through formal and informal religious  cultural and legal norms  But the recent high profile cases of young women fleeing male control in Saudi Arabia and the U A E  spoke for many Arab women who are no longer so willing to submit to male guardianship  This is especially true because women in many countries  Jordan  for instance  are now out graduating men in both high school and universities However  without a change in the laws of marriage  inheritance  divorce and child custody   all of which favor men   all the women doing well in school will never be able to realize their full potential in the work force  where they are still badly underrepresented  Something has to give  Meanwhile  it s hard for men to marry without a job  Having lots of men who have never held power  held a job or held a girl s hand is a prescription for social unrest   especially when they re all on Twitter Welcome to the new Middle East Where does this go  Leaders across the region are learning that they  can t rely on 20th century tools to keep the populations quiet any longer   remarked Marwan Muasher  the former foreign minister of Jordan  who now oversees research on the Middle East at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  The Arab Spring uprisings in 2011  broke the fear taboo in many Arab countries  and the collapse in oil prices since 2014 has broken the money bargain   Citizens now declare  If you can t guarantee me a government job  I get to say whatever I want Does that mean Jordan  for example  should change overnight to democracy  I asked Muasher   No   he said   but there has to be a process of greater power sharing between the governments and the people and civil society institutions  You can t keep asking people to sacrifice  to give up government jobs and subsidies  to accept higher taxes  but still not have a real voice in their own governance  So  is all the new news bad news  Actually not   at least in Jordan King Abdullah has been slow to share power  but he remains a decent leader  trying to develop a decent country of 10 million that now hosts 1 3 million Syrian refugees  His most important initiative may be his push seven years ago to launch a tech start up hub in Jordan that is also a new factor in the region  For the first time here you have hundreds of private sector start ups   independent of the government   working on social problems as business opportunities Luma Fawaz  the C E O  of Oasis500  the main Jordanian tech accelerator  brought me together with a group of young Jordanian starter uppers  So I met Bashar Arafeh  managing director in the Middle East and Africa for IrisGuard  whose technology includes a cellphone with lenses that can immediately identify you   through your iris   with near 100 percent accuracy  Connected to a United Nations refugee database using blockchain  it s being used  among other ways  to check if someone is indeed a Syrian refugee  who is supposed to receive aid  or someone else  who wants a ration card to sell on the black market  Refugees call the phone the  fingerprint of the eye  machine I met Zaid Farekh  who did well enough writing business software to start a local accelerator of his own  called Propeller Incorporated   I want to stay in Amman   he told me   because I believe we can build  100 million companies here  It s just a matter of time  I met Dina Shawar  C E O  of Adam Tech Ventures  which provides seed money to tech start ups trying to reshape their industries  She also built a discussion forum for Arab women tech entrepreneurs that recently brought over a team from London s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to teach women starter uppers how to project themselves at a board meeting or make a financial pitch I met Aysar Batayneh  who recently helped create the Jordan Trail  a 400 mile  650 kilometer  hiking path  It has spawned tourist hospitality businesses all along the way  I also met his wife  Mary Nazzal Batayneh  a founding partner of 17 Asset Management  which is taking the 17 U N  S D G s  sustainable development goals  like gender equality  clean water  sanitation and cheap  clean energy  and looking for ways to leverage private and government capital to create business opportunities to achieve them And I met Hussam Hammo  founder of Tamatem Games  which publishes mobile games culturally relevant for the Arab market   the fastest growing games market in the world  He credited Oasis500 with giving him a second chance after his first company went bankrupt and the local business culture  would not support anyone who failed in a start up   So  no  the new Middle East isn t doomed to upheaval  In Jordan  at least  it s the story of a race between a lot of bad trends  like too many young people who say  I work to get a government job so I have a job where I don t have to work  and a new growth mind set trying to scale  Jordan will be getting almost 20 percent of its energy from solar by 2020  the Ministry of Labor is trying all sorts of radical ideas to get more young people hired in the private sector The problem is that the hour is late  Political reform has been postponed too long and old cultural norms are still deeply rooted outside of Amman  As one Jordanian minister put it to me   We have to do everything  We have to do it all right  And we have to do it fast  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email

Department of Irony  Republicans can t stop howling about socialism  But nobody makes capitalism look worse than Donald Trump The president s party is trying to set up the 2020 election as a war against the S word   America will never be a socialist country   Trump announced in his last State of the Union speech  At a big gathering of conservatives  Mike Pence warned that  Medicare for all  and the Green New Deal were  the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations   over the past century  That system is socialism  There have certainly been socialist disaster cases around the world  although the Republican definition seems to include everyplace that has universal health coverage  But the magic of the marketplace can get you into plenty of trouble  too  For a good example of when the system doesn t work  just look at Trump s relationship with Deutsche Bank  which has given him about  2 billion in loans over the years  Two billion dollars to a guy whose major financial talent seems to be defaulting The Times s David Enrich took us through the story this week  It starts in the late 1990s when Deutsche Bank was a kind of minor league player who wanted to be cool and get into U S  commercial real estate lending in a big way  Where better to start than Trump  He owned stuff Well  at least sort of  Earlier in the decade he had been in such bad shape I felt compelled to refer to him as a  financially embattled thousandaire   Trump sent me a copy of that column with an arrow pointing to my picture  on which he had written  the face of a pig   I ve recounted that story many times in the past  but it s always sort of fun About Deutsche Bank  Trump wanted to borrow  125 million to renovate a building on Wall Street  In theory  the laws of self interest would have caused officials to look very carefully at their new client s financial history to make sure he was going to pay back everything he borrowed And what did they see  Well  at that point Trump was a host of WrestleMania and a frequent guest of the Howard Stern radio show  in which he would talk with his host about  um  dames And he had gotten famous for not paying back loans  But what the hell  The Deutschebankers said yes  Maybe they had read  The Art of the Deal  without noticing that it was clearly written by somebody else The longer Trump hung around with Deutsche Bank  the more beloved a customer he became  He was such a good   borrower   What s that old adage   if you owe a bank  10 000  the bank owns you  But if you owe the bank  10 million  you own the bank   mused Aaron Klein  a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution In 2003  when Trump wanted to borrow another wad of cash  Deutsche Bank invited potential bond investors to come in and hear his pitch  Tons of people responded  The problem  as Enrich reports  was that the vast majority just wanted to get a glimpse of a celebrity and had no plans on entrusting him with their money See  Sometimes the system works  However  eventually  the bankers did manage to find some buyers  After which Trump defaulted And back again  Deutsche Bank gave him a  640 million loan for a skyscraper he wanted to build in Chicago  The bankers must have been nervous  but Trump made a great sales pitch   he even promised to put Ivanka in charge of the project Think about this  What was Ivanka s best known project to date  Jared At this point the bank did a review of Trump s claim that he was worth about  3 billion and discovered it was more like  788 million But hey  He s friends with Mike Tyson The skyscraper got built  but nobody seemed to want to live there  Trump  who had personally guaranteed  40 million of the loan  then went to court  pointing to a clause in the contract that said he wouldn t have to cough up the money in the event of a natural disaster  And what about the recession  Was that a natural disaster or what Onward  More loans from Deutsche Bank  Some of which he used to pay back   Deutsche Bank  Nobody seemed to think that was crazy So  what s the problem here  Anat Admati  a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business  said she found it shocking that  a corporation the size and complexity of Deutsche Bank is so poorly governed  The bank  however  didn t run for president on the basis of its financial genius  Trump did  and it worked so well he is now running around making speeches about reducing business regulation Deutsche Bank  which had done so much to make him look like a financial titan over the years  was a little stunned by the election  The whole world was going to notice what a bad business risk this guy had been  How had the bank come to be his top underwriter Bring on the integrity committee  A Deutsche Bank investigation determined that its private banking division really  really liked doing business with famous people and was prepared to overlook pretty much everything else Is that a great economic model or what  Eat

Back in the 2000s  before social media s impact had played out  when it wasn t yet obligatory for artists to turn their work into a political statement  the trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah was already using music to envision change He rarely used vocals  but Mr  Scott wrote directly from his experiences growing up in the Upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans  and from his investigations into the history of race in America  His music combined musical legacies and pushed well beyond the standard approaches to contemporary jazz  on songs like  K K P D   and  Dred Scott   he was projecting something like a new vision for American society So  Ancestral Recall   Mr  Scott s bold new album  is only one link in a long chain of ambitious  broad minded work  And while it may not be his most immediately affecting album  that remains  Yesterday You Said Tomorrow   from 2010   it offers the kind of slow burning immersion that most of his recent records have only gestured at His main goal when making  Ancestral Recall  was to remind listeners that musical traditions centered on rhythm  African and Native American traditions in particular  have as much nuance and complexity as those built primarily around harmony  read  European   Across the album  Mr  Scott lets rhythms from West Africa and the Caribbean and New Orleans   from the pre Columbian era  the 19th century and today   lace in and out of one another ImageOn  Ancestral Recall   Mr  Scott draws from rhythms from West Africa and the Caribbean and New Orleans CreditRopeadope RecordsAt key moments  the poet Saul Williams interjects with lines of imagistic poetry  wandering from speech to rap to song in a style similar to that of Yasiin Bey  formerly Mos Def   On the title track  he intones Up from the water I was drowned The bullet exits the body The organs seal themselves The planes appear out of fire The people are praying right there where we left them While he is saying this  Mr  Scott surrounds him in beaming trumpet lines   declarative though unresolved   as if heralding the arrival of a new regime There have been two major stages of Mr  Scott s career   among the most high profile in jazz today  From 2007 to  12  he released three studio records that wriggled smartly away from genre concerns  Thanks in part to their drummers  Marcus Gilmore and Jamire Williams   each of whom had his own way of reconstituting the influence of Tony Williams   the songs on  Anthem    Yesterday You Said Tomorrow  and  Christian aTunde Adjuah  tumbled into your ear with the writhing  essential force of a feeling  or a mass of people on the move Since 2015 he has placed a new emphasis on patterned  polyrhythmic drumming  using a tightened up approach and more explicitly melding the sounds of modern hip hop with ancient  diasporic rhythms  His output of the past five plus years have been defined by Mr  Scott s interplay with the flute of Elena Pinderhughes and the latticework drumming of Corey Fonville   both of whom first joined the band on 2015 s  Stretch Music   a highlight   and who appear on  Ancestral Recall    as much as by its conceptual aspirations  The new album unifies the winning elements of Mr  Scott s past work  the historical syncretism  the tensile band energy  the powerful physicality The first track   Her Arrival   begins with a group of percussionists playing hand drums and a babble of voices rising up  It sounds like a street scene  and it s an early indication that this will be music of embodiment  You can nearly walk around inside it  Midway through the album  on the graceful  Overcomer   a slapping drumbeat disappears early in the track and a pastel silence takes over  then a mist of harmonizing voices comes in  with a cajón  an Afro South American percussion instrument  being pounded below  When Mr  Scott takes a solo  his trumpet starts at a whisper and grows more distorted  Soon he s alternating between spinning thick twirls of blues  à la Louis Armstrong  and pelting spears like Hugh Masekela Mr  Scott is not a collegiate sounding trumpet player  and he plays with as much deference to New Orleanian and continental African traditions as to bebop  As a result  he plays fewer notes than most jazz trumpeters today  and his projection is more immediately majestic  He is following a path of his own  and so far  it s still breaking new ground 
HONG KONG   Vladimir Lenin  Mao Zedong  And now  a giant reptile Vietnam has embalmed a turtle that many saw as a symbol of the country s independence and longevity until its death in 2016  the state run news media reported The move catapults the animal  known as Cu Rua  or Great Grandfather Turtle  into an elite club of famous figures embalmed and put on display by Communist regimes  That list includes Lenin  Mao  Kim Il sung and Kim Jong il of North Korea  and Ho Chi Minh  Vietnam s own revolutionary hero  The extremely rare giant turtle has been plastinated and lodged in a temple  at Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi  the capital  where it once lived  the news site VnExpress reported on Tuesday  Plastination  a method of preserving bodies by infusing them with resins  was developed by a German anatomist in the 1970s In plastic as in life  Cu Rua carries immense spiritual and cultural significance in Vietnam A Vietnamese legend says that in the 15th century  a nationalist hero borrowed a magic sword  used it to drive out occupying Chinese forces and returned it to a turtle that surfaced in Hoan Kiem  the Lake of the Returned Sword  A turtle shrine was built on a small island in the lake in the 1880s  and the  great grandfather  that died there in 2016 was widely thought to be the earthly embodiment of the ancient legend The  returned sword  legend is convenient for Vietnam s government as a nationalist symbol of resistance to China  the country s northern neighbor and former occupier Cu Rua s death  which occurred during a heated national debate about Vietnam s perceived political and economic dependence on China  prompted an outpouring of sadness  Some Vietnamese saw it as a bad omen for the country and the ruling Communist Party  which has been in power for decades Cu Rua was believed to have died of natural causes  But Hoan Kiem Lake is notoriously polluted  and the turtle was occasionally seen surfacing for oxygen in the years before it died ImageCu Rua underwent plastination  a method of preserving bodies by infusing them with resins CreditLuong Thai Linh EPA  via ShutterstockThe death was also a loss for biological history because Cu Rua  who weighed an estimated 360 pounds  had been among the last of the Yangtze giant soft shell turtles The species  known as Rafetus swinhoei  was once common in northern Vietnam s Red River Delta but was hunted down in the 1970s and 1980s  Cu Rua s death left just three known specimens   a couple in a zoo in Suzhou  China  and one turtle in Dong Mo Lake  outside Hanoi  whose sex has not been revealed The Suzhou turtles have produced no offspring  Tim McCormack  the program director of the Asian Turtle Program  a conservation group based in Hanoi  wrote last April  But he added that a fourth member of the species had been found in Xuan Khanh Lake  outside Hanoi  fueling hopes that wild Rafetus swinhoei could be brought together for captive breeding A few months later  Mr  McCormack wrote that the program had potentially found a second turtle of the same species in Dong Mo Lake  but that more investigation was needed to confirm the discovery  He said on Wednesday that a  species recovery  alliance  including Vietnamese officials and international wildlife advocacy groups  was working on a plan to capture known members of the species  determine their sex and possibly breed them  Finding the second animal has got people excited in the species again  and we believe it can be saved if we can bring them together   Mr  McCormack said in an email After Cu Rua s death  the corpse was kept in cold storage for weeks at the Vietnam National Museum of Nature  at minus 15 degrees Celsius  as the authorities debated how best to preserve it  It is not simple to mummify the turtle  so intensive consideration is inevitable   Nguyen Trung Minh  the museum s director general  said in 2016  The government ultimately rejected traditional mummification techniques and opted to plastify the animal instead  with help from German experts The plastinated Cu Rua now shares a room in Ngoc Son Temple with an embalmed relative who died in 1967  It can now be safely displayed at room temperature  but to shield it from dust  mildew and sunlight  the authorities have placed it in a glass case Ngoc Son Temple sits on an island in Hoan Kiem Lake that is connected to shore by a footbridge  The lake is a short drive from Ho Chi Minh s granite and marble mausoleum  which Kim Jong un  North Korea s leader  visited this month after his failed summit meeting with President Trump 
Yes  of course  we need a Green New Deal to address the world s most urgent crisis  global warming Just  please  not the one that a flotilla of liberal politicians  including seven of the top Democratic presidential hopefuls currently in the Senate  are signing up for in droves  like children following the pied piper in the old legend Our modern day pied piper  Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  is trying to lure us into a set of policies that might help save the planet but at the cost of severely damaging the global economy To be sure  by the time the resolution was introduced into Congress  some of its most ludicrous provisions  like the deadline of 2030 for a full transition to renewable energy and the immediate halt to any investment in fossil fuels  had been eliminated or watered down But as important as continuing to prune the absurd or damaging provisions would be to add what is the most effective way to attack climate change  using taxes and market forces rather than government controls to reduce harmful emissions That has been a problem for decades  at least since Washington got seriously into the business of improving the environment  back in 1970 with the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency   under President Richard Nixon Politicians prefer that approach because using regulation hides the costs of reducing emissions  The decision  for example  to force improvements in automobile mileage by requiring each manufacturer to improve overall fleet efficiency has added thousands of dollars to the cost of cars Higher car prices have the countervailing impact of encouraging Americans to hang onto their older  less fuel efficient cars for a longer time  offsetting at least some of the gains from newer cars  Nor have the regulations  with their many escape hatches  kept consumers from buying even more sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks as gas prices have remained historically low RelatedMore on carbon taxes Opinion   The Editorial BoardBest Way to Fight Climate Change  Put an Honest Price on CarbonOct  29  2018Fortunately  there is a better way to address the climate problem at far lower cost to the economy  a tax on greenhouse gas emissions  That can be imposed in any number of ways  The 18 4 cent federal gasoline tax  for example  hasn t been increased since 1993 even as most other developed countries impose far higher levies A particularly thoughtful proposal has come from the Climate Leadership Council  a bipartisan organization that counts more than 3 300 economists among its signatories  Elegant in its simplicity  the key provision would be the imposition of an escalating tax on carbon  At an initial rate of  43 per ton  the levy would be roughly equivalent to 38 2 cents per gallon of gasoline To prevent polluters from fleeing overseas  the tax would be imposed on imports from countries lacking a similar provision while exports to those countries would not be taxed  While difficult to implement  that component is important to work out The entire proceeds from the tax would be rebated to consumers  The council suggests an equal amount for each American  my view would be to exclude the wealthy  who hardly need the estimated  2 000 a year in payments  and disproportionately favor those closer to the bottom Why are so many economists  even conservative ones  in favor of a massive new tax  Because markets do not always price in  externalities  like pollution  In addition to cutting consumption  raising the price of carbon would arguably do more to encourage development of alternative power sources than all the massive new government spending programs that advocates of the Green New Deal envision Some technical problems would need to be addressed  such as how the higher prices would filter through inflation calculations and create unintended cost of living adjustments to wages and Social Security payments But those are details  the key point is that a carbon tax has been judged by climate hawks like Resources for the Future to be far more effective in reaching the goals of the Paris agreement than the well intended regulations put in place by President Barack Obama and his predecessors That s at least part of why the plan enjoys support from an armada of organizations not often on the same page  like Exxon Mobil and Conservation International Historically  the politics of even small increases in the gasoline tax have been tough  A 2017 proposal in the House to increase tax by just one penny went nowhere  But recent polls suggest that perhaps sentiment is changing  a survey by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago found that 44 percent of Americans favor a carbon tax while only 29 percent oppose one Given how late we are to the climate battle  maintaining some sensible regulation will also be necessary  But a hefty carbon tax would go a long way toward winning the war The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of

Bernard Krisher  an idealistic  driven journalist who founded Cambodia s first English language daily newspaper and  as a philanthropist  established a hospital  an orphanage and hundreds of schools around Cambodia  died on March 5 in Tokyo  He was 87 His death was reported on Monday by his newspaper  The Cambodia Daily  which quoted family members as saying the cause was heart failure In a long career that included 13 years as Tokyo bureau chief for Newsweek magazine  Mr  Krisher became a fixture of Asia journalism  specializing in exclusive interviews with figures like President Sukarno of Indonesia and Emperor Hirohito of Japan He founded The Daily in 1993  one year after the founding of its rival  The Phnom Penh Post  which was originally published every two weeks before becoming a daily years later The newspapers were a sign of a new openness and optimism in Cambodia as it was struggling to its feet after decades of mass killings and civil war  That hopefulness has faded  however  amid a crackdown on the free press by Prime Minister Hun Sen  who has been in power for 34 years and who has also targeted independent agencies and opposition politicians The Daily pledged to report  all the news without fear or favor   bringing it into continuing conflict with Mr  Hun Sen  The newspaper was forced to close its print edition last year under government legal pressure  Bernie believed passionately in journalism and what good journalism could achieve   said Kevin Doyle  who worked for the paper for 15 years  most of them as editor in chief   He believed professional journalism served a higher  more important purpose in society than politics or even law at times  Mr  Krisher would often say   Persistence  energy  enthusiasm are the key essentials of this profession  and the main enemy is cynicism  Though his newspaper had a circulation of just a few thousand  it wielded outsize influence as an important source of local and international news for diplomats and aid workers  It hired young Cambodian and foreign journalists  many of whom would go on to significant careers The paper also carried a daily insert translated into Cambodian  and its special weekend editions presented magazine quality journalism  Bernie taught his local reporters how to stand up to those in power by reporting the truth   said Mu Sochua  an opposition politician who has fled overseas to avoid government reprisals   Bernie was a tough man and demanded justice for those without a voice  ImageThe Cambodia Daily was forced to close its print edition last year under government legal pressure  Though it had a small circulation  it had outsize influence CreditOmar Havana for The New York TimesThe newspaper was part of a personal project by Mr  Krisher to help the country recover from years of war and violent persecution  His philanthropy included the construction of more than 550 schools  financed by private donors  the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank His prized achievement was the founding of the Sihanouk Hospital Center of Hope  which provides free medical care to the poor  He also established an education center for orphans and foster children from remote villages The Daily also sponsored frequent drives to raise money for the distribution of tens of thousands of mosquito nets to poor Cambodians  and Mr  Krisher raised money to provide rice to schools and orphanages when the World Food Program stopped a feeding program  I am in awe of what he was able to accomplish  as one person with two long careers   his daughter  Deborah Krisher Steele  said by email   He had both the tenacity and optimism to make it possible  Not everybody loved Mr  Krisher  He could be obstinate  demanding and confrontational  He could be unrelenting against personal enemies and those who he felt had crossed him   Mr  Doyle said   So there existed a quite polarized view of Bernie  I spent many years working with Bernie  and I saw both sides  Ker Munthit  a former reporter for The Associated Press in its Cambodia bureau  said in an email that Mr  Krisher  was pushy and insisting in whatever he had in mind that he wanted to advance or be done  and that could be a bit annoying   However   Mr  Munthit added   regardless of the misgivings one might have about him   me included   it is undeniable that he has done some great things for the good of the country  Bernard Krisher was born on Aug  9  1931  in Frankfurt  His father  a Polish Jew  owned a fur shop  The family fled Nazi Germany in 1937 and passed through France  Spain and Portugal before heading for the United States and settling in New York City  in Queens His daughter said his humanitarian work was inspired by the help that he and his family had received from strangers when they were fleeing persecution  He believed  she said   that a true humanitarian act is to help a stranger  not one of your own  Mr  Krisher attended Queens College and was drafted into the Army in 1953  He spent two years in Germany as a reporter for Stars and Stripes  the Army newspaper  He then worked for The New York World Telegram and Sun and studied journalism at Columbia University He joined Newsweek in 1962 after moving to Japan  where he became its Tokyo bureau chief in 1967  He later left Newsweek for Fortune magazine In Japan  he met his future wife  Akiko  who survives  In addition to his daughter  he is survived by a son  Joseph  and two grandsons

for me were not when people challenged what I said  but when I felt my voice was not heard    Carol Gilligan  co author of a new book   Why Does Patriarchy Persist  Remember in  Terminator 2  how the bad terminator kept getting smashed and shattered and ripped apart  but it didn t matter  He just kept re emerging  rising from the ashes  as an unstoppable force  Now imagine that terminator is a vessel to keep power  wealth and status in the hands of men   that s the patriarchy  It can feel indestructible  coming back ever stronger despite seemingly endless efforts to smash it  But why and how  after decades of activism  does the patriarchy persist  That s what Carol Gilligan  the psychologist and ethicist  and Naomi Snider  a former student of Dr  Gilligan s  were determined to unpack in their new book   Why Does Patriarchy Persist  The answer may seem obvious  It persists because it maintains a system in which men hold power   political  economic  institutional   and what man would want to give that up  But Snider and Gilligan contend that this is more a symptom of patriarchy and less cause Women and men  they say  internalize patriarchy without realizing it  pushing aside their best judgment and sacrificing their needs in order to fall in line with how they think they re supposed to behave  By not falling in line  they risk sticking out for all the wrong reasons  potentially driving away friends  partners or professional opportunities  ultimately resulting in isolation  READ MORE  Carol Gilligan Reminds Us That We re All Humans That fear is instilled in us early  they say  With boys being taught that crying is synonymous with weakness  for example  while girls learn that assertiveness equals aggressiveness  As adults  it manifests in other ways  In how women shoulder their family s emotional labor  meaning the invisible mental work of holding a household and relationship together  If a woman registers that this is unfair and complains  she s often told that she s  selfish  a drama queen  hysterical   Snider said  Eventually   she believes it   That s patriarchy Snider also cited the cliché of a woman who doesn t tell a man she is dating that she wants a committed relationship for fear of scaring him off and being rejected  That too is patriarchy  Snider said  In essence  Gillian and Snider write  patriarchy harms both men and women by forcing men to act like they don t need relationships and women to act like they don t need a sense of self  The crux  though  is that we are  not supposed to see or to say this   they write At the end of  Terminator 2   the bad terminator is finally destroyed because he is incinerated  decimating him to the core  If it s true that patriarchy is now hard wired into our minds  it may take a

They don t call them problem plays for nothing You know the kind I mean  Often set in tasteful living rooms  they tend to feature an upper middle class family dealing portentously with a topical issue as it affects their narrow interests   Intermarriage  homosexuality  political scandal  adultery and alcoholism have all been apt subjects in their day   Often  there s an accusation of wrongdoing  and a courtroom or confession to resolve it  After   a play by Michael McKeever that opened on Sunday at 59E59 Theaters  checks all the boxes  Tasteful living room  You betcha  The gray and pale blue décor of the Campbell family s suburban home  designed by Brian Prather  would not look out of place in a catalog   perhaps one called Crate   Gun Barrel Tate Campbell  Michael Frederic  is a proud hunter  you see  A noble if ominous deer head looms above the hearth  and a brace of rifles stands at attention nearby in a handsome display case  But Tate s perfectionist wife  Julia  Mia Matthews   finds the deer head  horrible   and not just because it throws off her color scheme   A beautiful young animal like that   she sighs   displayed as some sort of trophy  When she adds that the deer is  about the same age as Kyle    the Campbells  17 year old son   you may feel that the play itself has been stuffed and mounted Yes  we are dealing with teenagers and gun violence   but only in the most artificial way  Kyle has sent a text message to a classmate  Matthew  using an anti gay epithet as part of what could be a threat  His parents consider this just a stupid adolescent prank  but Matthew s parents  the Beckmans  do not  They want the school to live up to its  zero tolerance  policy on bullying instead of slapping Kyle s wrist with a three day suspension  They want him expelled In the first third of the play  titled  Before   the Beckmans show up chez Campbell  Julia having invited them over to discuss the matter reasonably  You know that s not happening  Connie Beckman  Denise Cormier  is already vibrating with resentment the second she arrives  her ugly green outfit lets us know that she s not as upper middle class as Julia  who wears mostly ecru and taupe   The overstated costumes are by Gregory Gale   Connie s husband  Alan  Bill Phillips   seems calmer at first but is the one who winds up doing something crazy It would spoil the story  such as it is  to give away what happens in Part 2   During   and Part 3   After    Let s just say that if it weren t for the play s ludicrous reversals and recurrent eddies of argument  it would last about 10 minutes instead of 85  There s even a fifth character   Julia s sister  Val   whose only function is to deliver a crucial plot point by answering her cellphone ImageMs  Matthews  left  and Ms  Curtsinger in the play

butlers in plays like this  What s new onstage and off  Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter  So why are some  plays like this  quite engaging when this one is not  You can t blame the cast members  who ride the hairpin turns of their characters with nearly convincing finesse  Nor is the subject of gun violence and its aftermath unworthy   at least when addressed  as in many recent dramas  sincerely  If only that were the case here But the violence in  After  feels opportunistic  Because it happens entirely offstage  and because its resolution is delivered secondhand  it makes us suspect that the play we are watching is really about something else  Exactly what is hard to say  though I think it may mean to ask what responsibility parents bear for the moral and psychological health of their children  Tate is a hothead  Julia  neurotic  Connie and Alan give helicopters a bad name  Only Val  Jolie Curtsinger  seems to be a sensible adult  so naturally her son gets into Dartmouth Even if those traits were persuasively related to the plot  there would be the problem of the plot itself  which is about as subtle as that deer head  It s a drawback shared  if less detrimentally  by Mr  McKeever s play  Daniel s Husband   which had Off Broadway runs in 2017 and 2018   Daniel s Husband   about the problem of gay couples who lack adequate legal protection in the event of a catastrophe  was moving but manipulative  the characters were little more than chessmen arranged to produce a devastating checkmate Likewise here  except that  After  is moving only to the extent we may feel obliged to honor the enormous exertions of the actors trying to gin up tears  The story is too baldly engineered   too bullying  in fact   to engage the audience in the manner necessary to produce empathy The enervating production exacerbates the problem  Joe Brancato  who directed  After  as well as  Daniel s Husband  after developing both at his Penguin Rep Theater in Rockland County  N Y   seems more interested in simplifying than in complicating the play s schematic conflicts  You could follow the action almost perfectly with the sound turned off Actually  that might be a good idea  The saving grace of problem play authors like Yasmina Reza   God of Carnage    Art   and Terence Rattigan   Man and Boy    The Winslow Boy   is their artful  witty dialogue  scoring points and defining characters while tickling the ear  Mr  McKeever s dialogue sounds as if it were lifted from a concordance of morose clichés   You think I don t know that    Don t for one second    And the last thing I need is      Now if you ll excuse me      Never step foot in this house again  Point taken 
I m a recent convert to budget airlines  even though I may have once thrown a tantrum at the Ryanair check in counter when they charged me 40 euros for forgetting to print out my boarding pass Frequent fliers may turn up their noses when they hear I ve traded miles toward Delta Platinum status to fly airlines that have suggested charging passengers to use the bathroom while flying at one point  possibly removing seats to make passengers strap up and stand for the duration of the flight  and the ever evolving hidden fees on others  For the most part however  low budget international carriers like Norwegian Air and Wow Air have managed to work out the kinks  in my view  to make flying low budget worthwhile  Here are some tips to fly on a budget and deplane with your sanity intact More on budget flightsGood Cheap Flights Still Exist  Here s How to Find Them Nov  22  2018Be smart when you bookBudget airlines don t fly year round to the same locations  Instead they open up chunks of time when you can book a flight to certain destinations  That also means people looking for a deal to a specific place all have to book   and travel   at the same time Twice a year  I travel to Cork  Ireland to see family  It had become expensive to take two trans Atlantic trips with multiple legs  So  once those March to October Cork flights on Norwegian Air opened up  I booked a  300 dollar leg from Rhode Island immediately for a July visit  It was a couple hundred dollars more to book a flight from Georgia to Rhode Island  If you re looking for similar deals  do some research on when the  high season  is in the place you d like to visit  That same flight  also five hours longer because of the longer layover and flying past Ireland to Amsterdam for the connection  was nearly  1 400 dollars on KLM If peak flight and travel season for  let s say  Iceland is May to September  look out for  99 Wow Air flights for January  Reykjavik  or any new location  is fun  no matter the time of year  Just bring extra sweaters Get around baggage restrictionsNo one wants to stand in front of the check in counter shifting headphones and chargers from the carry on to your backpack  then to your checked bag just to avoid weight or size limits  Just pay for the bag   Or read the fine print before you book  and be prepared to travel light  If you re traveling with someone  though  remember that budget airlines usually charge you for baggage on each leg  That means one person can pay for a checked bag or carry on  while the other books an economy seat with no add ons  That s at least a hundred dollars in baggage fees saved  But what that also means is that one of you  the person who didn t pay for a carry on or checked bag  sometimes you will have to pay a little extra to sit next to your flying partner  For example  JetBlue doesn t charge you to choose an economy seat  Spirit Airlines charges begin at  5 per leg  Norwegian Airlines begin at about  12 dollars  Most of the time  it costs about  6 to  15 dollars to choose your seat with this basic price  and you two can choose seats simultaneously and end up next to each other on the flight Choose a strategic seatMost people automatically associate budget airlines with uncomfortable seats  Sure  they may not be as plush as airlines with bigger planes and more amenities  but I haven t been on an uncomfortable budget flight in a long time because I keep an eye on the seats Here s what I mean  When you first book  book toward the back of the plane  It may sound counterintuitive  but because everyone always seems to want to be up front  maybe they think it s quicker to get on and off the plane  even though it usually isn t   even though the seats are all the same  Plus  unlike bigger airlines  I haven t been on a budget flight leaving the United States in a long time that was booked completely and sold out  Where are those empty seats  you ask  In the back  with me Also  if you re traveling with someone  book the window and the aisle  No one likes the center seat  so your odds are higher someone just won t book it   and if they do  you can always offer them the aisle or window so you can sit together  Who would refuse Social media is the best way to get helpBudget airlines are much smaller operations than their large  international counterparts  Reaching someone via Twitter direct message or Facebook message can be pretty easy  No one answered my question via email on an overnight flight to Europe  so before we took off I sent a message to the airline on Twitter  By the

A year ago  the world learned that Facebook allowed a political consulting company called Cambridge Analytica to exploit the personal information of up to 87 million users  to obtain data that would help the company s clients  fight a culture war  in America Since then  a torrent of reports has revealed that the Cambridge Analytica scandal was part of a much broader pattern of misconduct by Facebook It has paid teenagers to spy on their behavior  even asking users  to screenshot their Amazon order history page   according to the website TechCrunch  The company has secretly collected highly sensitive data through the back doors of other apps  such as ovulation trackers  to target ads at users  even if no Facebook account is used to log in and if the end user isn t a Facebook member   The Wall Street Journal reported  And in its pursuit of dominance  Facebook gave at least 60 device makers direct access to its users  data  Those actions are under criminal investigation  The Times reported last week  Facebook has also engaged in campaigns to obstruct congressional oversight and to smear and discredit critics   tactics reminiscent of the big tobacco playbook After each misdeed becomes public  Facebook alternates between denial  hollow promises and apology campaigns But nothing changes  That s why  as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Antitrust  Commercial and Administrative Law  I am calling for an investigation into whether Facebook s conduct has violated antitrust laws Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal  the Federal Trade Commission has confirmed that it is investigating Facebook to determine whether it violated a consent order it entered into with the commission in 2011  While we await the outcome of the commission s investigation  other enforcement agencies and government authorities have already taken action  The attorney general for the District of Columbia filed a complaint months ago  German antitrust authorities issued an order finding that Facebook abused its dominance and limiting Facebook s data collection practices  And an investigation by the British Parliament compared Facebook to a company of  digital gangsters  that considers itself  ahead of and beyond the law  The F T C  is facing a massive credibility crisis For years  privacy advocates have alerted the commission that Facebook was likely violating its commitments under the agreement  Not only did the commission fail to enforce its order  but by failing to block Facebook s acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram  it enabled Facebook to extend its dominance RelatedMore on antitrustOpinion   Tim WuAntitrust Returns to American PoliticsMarch 13  2019How the commission chooses to respond to Facebook s repeated abuses will determine whether it is willing or able to promote competition and protect consumers  If the commission does conclude that Facebook has violated the consent order  how it fixes this problem through a legal remedy will be a test of its effectiveness  The commission has the authority to impose substantial fines on Facebook  Given that the corporation had more than  55 billion in revenue in 2018 alone  even a fine in the low billions of dollars will amount to a slap on the wrist  a mere cost of doing business Moreover  because Facebook is a repeat offender  it is critical that the commission s response is strong enough to prevent future violations  America s laws are not suggestions  When a company has repeatedly shown contempt for its legal commitments  the remedy must change how the company operates  Enforcement agencies can do this through deep reforms of the company s structure  This includes removing members of the company s board  or even top executives  along with other changes to the company s business model to address dysfunction at the top The F T C  can also pursue other ways to fix this problem  For example  after German antitrust enforcers found that Facebook abused its dominant market position  it required Facebook to stop combining different sources of its users  data without their consent But the commission should not stop there  There is also mounting evidence of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook that may warrant scrutiny by federal antitrust enforcers  For example  the social media goliath has reportedly systematically spied on its rivals  giving it valuable information on how people used competitive products Facebook s predatory acquisition strategy has also arguably resulted in fewer innovative services  When it bought TBH  a polling app popular with teenagers  Facebook announced that the app would still operate independently and under its own brand  Less than a year later  Facebook scuttled it due to  low usage  Facebook also appears to have used its dominance to cripple other competitive threats by cutting them off from its massive network  In 2013  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  personally approved the company s decision to block Vine  a fast growing rival  from a critical Facebook feature  to the advantage of its own online video service Finally  in what looks to be a dangerous power grab to head off antitrust action  Facebook recently announced plans to merge Instagram  WhatsApp and Facebook into one integrated product  furthering its monopoly power Together  these reports suggest a disturbing pattern of anticompetitive conduct  Watchdogs and consumers alike report that the quality of Facebook s products has declined  It has killed innovation and eliminated competitive threats  And the price for advertising on the platform has continued to rise In other words  there is a smoking gun American antitrust agencies have not pursued a significant monopoly case in more than two decades  even as corporate concentration and monopoly power have reached historic levels It s clear that serious enforcement is long overdue David N  Cicilline  a member of the House of Representatives  is

As authorities rushed to stop a gunman on a mass killing spree in New Zealand  engineers  programmers and content moderators around the globe were scrambling to keep the rampage from going viral  It didn t work  The terrorist in Christchurch killed 50 people at two mosques on Friday  livestreaming part of the attack on Facebook  The original video was taken down within an hour  But copies proliferated across the major platforms  On Saturday night  Facebook announced that it had removed 1 5 million copies of the video  with 1 2 million blocked at the moment they were uploaded  YouTube declined to give numbers  although its chief product officer told The Washington Post that at times  a copy of the video was being uploaded every second  After decades of shunning responsibility for user content  Big Tech is slowly making its products safer for society   banning anti vaccine misinformation  for instance  and cracking down on political disinformation  More moderation comes with heavy risks  of course  Decisions about the limits of free speech would shift to companies whose priorities are driven by shareholders  But the viral spread of the Christchurch shooting video shows the limits of the content moderation machine in the face of technologies that have been designed to be attention traps  Stricter moderation or filtering systems are not the answer  It must be a priority to redesign technology to respect the common good  instead of ignoring it There is a special urgency when it comes to mass killings  since media amplification can inspire copycat killings  and only so much can be done in a crisis where every hour counts  Filtering systems have been relatively successful where time is not of the essence   copyright infringement never kills anyone  even if it stays up for a week  On longer time scales  moderation works reasonably well  For about a decade or longer  the tech companies have automatically filtered out child pornography in a partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  which maintains a database of  fingerprinted  videos  Starting in 2016  major platforms adapted that technology to filter for  terrorist  content  But this kind of filtering only works when new content matches known banned content through a form of digital fingerprinting  Although the video of the New Zealand attack was fingerprinted immediately  countless thousands of people beat the filter over and over again by recutting  editing  watermarking and modifying the video itself  While harder to find on major social media platforms  copies of the video are still easily found online It was once the sole province of the press to think about how to cover such tragedies in a responsible way  As media consumption shifts online  it is now on the tech companies to use their considerable ingenuity to grapple with mitigating the public health crisis of mass killings RelatedIn Christchurch  Signs Point to a Gunman Steeped in Internet

InternetNov  24  2018Keeping the internet  or at the very least social media  free from vile content is grueling work  The experience of content moderators for Facebook raises troubling questions about the future of human moderation and the wider danger that online content poses to public health  Repeated exposure to conspiracy theories   say  that the earth is flat or that the Holocaust didn t happen   turns out to sway content moderators  an effect that may very well be playing out in the population at large  Repeated exposure to images of violence and sexual exploitation often leaves moderators with post traumatic stress disorder  Moderators have reported crying on the job or sleeping with guns by their side  Turnover is high  pay is low  and although they have access to on site counselors  many moderators develop symptoms of PTSD after leaving the job We don t know if moderators are canaries for the social media consuming public at large or if their heavy dose of the worst of the web makes them outliers  Is repeated exposure to conspiracy theories   often given boosts by recommendation algorithms   swaying the general public  in some cases leading to public health emergencies like the measles outbreak  Is extremist propaganda fueling a surge in right wing violence The killer in New Zealand sought to hijack the attention of the internet  and the millions of uploads of his video   both attempted and achieved   were a natural consequence of what the platforms are designed to promote in users  the desire to make content go viral In the midst of the crisis this weekend  YouTube resorted to temporarily disabling the ability to search recently uploaded videos  It s not the first time a platform has disabled a function of its product in response to tragedy  In July  WhatsApp limited message forwarding in India in the wake of lynchings fueled by rumors spread by users of the service  The change became global in January in an effort to fight  misinformation and rumors  It s telling that the platforms must make themselves less functional in the interests of public safety  What happened this weekend gives an inkling of how intractable the problem may be  Internet platforms have been designed to monopolize human attention by any means necessary  and the content moderation machine is a flimsy check on a system that strives to overcome all forms of friction  The best outcome for the public now may be that Big Tech limits its own usability and reach  even if that comes at the cost of some profitability  Unfortunately  it s also the outcome least likely to happen The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed the United States to recognize Israeli governance of most of the Golan Heights during a visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday  His efforts underscored the growing possibility that the Trump administration may change the American stance on the territory Mr  Netanyahu has pushed repeatedly for the United States to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the western Golan Heights  which Israel seized from Syria in the Six Day War of 1967 and later annexed There are recent signs that the Trump administration could be moving in Mr  Netanyahu s direction  An annual human rights report released last Wednesday by the State Department used the phrase  Israeli controlled  rather than  Israeli occupied  to describe the Golan Heights  the West Bank and Gaza  counter to the tradition  The Trump administration has also pushed back against United Nations condemnations of Israel s occupation Mr  Netanyahu will visit Mr  Trump next week  the White House announced on Wednesday  a trip that could offer the prime minister s troubled re election campaign a lift  Mr  Netanyahu also plans to speak at the annual conference of Aipac  the pro Israel lobbying group On Wednesday  Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Pompeo appeared together to offer remarks to reporters following a one on one meeting in the prime minister s compound in Jerusalem Mr  Netanyahu said Israeli intelligence officials had discovered last week that Hezbollah  the Lebanese military and political group with ties to Iran  was trying to set up a network in the Syrian controlled portion of the Golan Heights  posing a threat to Israel  I can say that all of you can imagine what would have happened if Israel were not in the Golan   Mr  Netanyahu said   We would have Iran on the shores of the Sea of Galilee  I think for this reason and for many more  I think it s time the international community recognizes Israel s stay in the Golan  the fact that the Golan will always remain part of the state of Israel  Mr  Pompeo did not mention the Golan Heights  but he talked expansively about the need for the United States and Israel to work together to counter Iran and about the Trump administration s backing for Israel s security  With such threats a daily reality of Israeli life  we maintain our unparalleled commitment to Israel s security and firmly support your right to defend yourselves   Mr  Pompeo said Mr  Netanyahu praised President Trump for withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran last year  a move Mr  Trump made even though American intelligence agencies said Iran had not been trying to build nuclear weapons  He also said American sanctions against Iran appeared to be working  adding that he and Mr  Pompeo had discussed in their meeting how to  intensify the pressure even more  ImageMr  Pompeo talked expansively about the need for the United States and Israel to work together to counter Iran CreditPool photo by Jim YoungMr  Netanyahu could press the issue of the Golan Heights with Mr  Trump when he meets with him on Monday and Tuesday  Any big gesture by Mr  Trump could help Mr  Netanyahu in his bid for a fifth term in elections scheduled for April 9  But even being seen side by side with the American president could give Mr  Netanyahu a lift with some Israeli voters A shadow has fallen over Mr  Netanyahu s chances since the Israeli attorney general announced last month that he intended to indict Mr  Netanyahu on bribery and other corruption charges Many Israeli conservatives have applauded Mr  Trump s policies  He has recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv  and cut aid to Palestinian refugees  Last November  for the first time  the United States voted against a symbolic resolution that the United Nations issues annually that condemns Israel s presence in the Golan Heights Mr  Trump s son in law  Jared Kushner  has been working on a peace plan that many analysts say would take a hard line approach toward traditional Palestinian demands Despite the pre election timing  Mr  Pompeo s visit got little coverage Wednesday night on Israel s top rated evening news show There have been at least three occasions in the late 20th century when American presidents tried to influence Israeli elections  according to Aaron David Miller  a Middle East scholar at the Wilson Center who worked on Arab Israeli negotiations as a State Department official  He cited efforts by President George Bush and then President Bill Clinton  one of which involved Mr  Clinton trying to boost Shimon Peres over Mr  Netanyahu  The Trump administration s re elect Netanyahu campaign is in full swing   Mr  Miller said   Pompeo s Israel stop   rare for a secretary of state this close to an Israeli election   is designed to show that the U S  and Israel are in sync on policy  especially Iran  On Wednesday morning  before flying to Israel  Mr  Pompeo held a news conference in Kuwait City with the foreign minister of Kuwait  An American reporter asked Mr  Pompeo for the exact position of the United States on the West Bank and Golan Heights  Were they or were they not occupied by Israel Mr  Pompeo said only  there s been no change in U S  policy  but did not lay out the policy On Monday night  a reporter accompanying Mr  Pompeo on the flight to Kuwait asked him whether the State Department had made a deliberate change to language in the human rights report by using  Israeli controlled  rather than  Israeli occupied   This was a factual statement about how we observe the situation   Mr  Pompeo said   And we think it s very accurate  and we stand behind it  Last year  the State Department s human rights report stopped using  occupied  in headlines on the West Bank and Gaza  but kept the word in the text In Lebanon  on the final stop of his trip  Mr  Pompeo plans to denounce Hezbollah He has also been pressuring Iraq to distance itself from neighboring Iran  That has raised tensions with Iraqi leaders and even with Pentagon and C I A  officials  who say Mr  Pompeo s hard line stand on Iran was jeopardizing ties between the United States and Iraq  where 5 200 American troops are based  Mr  Pompeo had already strained ties with European allies over Iran policy 
One of the great achievements of politics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the spread of effective building codes that made our buildings safer and sturdier  and our cities less likely to burn down For the last couple of decades we have been using those building codes for an additional purpose  saving energy  The average house or office building constructed today is required to have better windows and insulation than the drafty old buildings we used to put up  so that a new building wastes far less energy over its lifetime Making buildings more efficient not only saves consumers money  it is also crucial in the fight against global warming because it cuts the use of fossil fuels  We are a few months away from an election  of sorts  that could tighten our building codes still further But forces are already stirring in the land to make sure this vote goes the wrong way  Those forces may be abetted by low voter turnout  which has been a big problem in the past  If history repeats itself this year  the energy policy of the United States may be influenced by fewer than 500 people The technology of buildings continually evolves  creating new ways to save energy  Tightening our building codes regularly is the best way to pull these new techniques into the market  However  building to the latest standards can cost a little extra money  at least initially  so you can probably guess where some of the opposition originates ImageA public library in Cambridge  Mass   has an environmentally friendly and energy efficient design CreditA P  Cortizas Jr E   via Getty ImagesAmerica has no national building code  strictly speaking  States and cities adopt and enforce their own  These local codes tend to be based on a few national model codes put out by several organizations  generally every three years One of the most important models is the International Energy Conservation Code  which many American communities use as the template for their energy saving code provisions  The latest version will be finalized in a round of voting later this year  and most communities will decide in 2020 whether to incorporate it into their own codes  So in this election  the  candidates  are proposed new standards for how people ought to construct buildings in the United States  Who gets to vote  Basically  the governments that will ultimately decide whether to adopt this code as their own pick representatives to cast ballots  Small towns get a handful of votes while big cities get more  Municipalities tend to nominate representatives with expertise in the subject   say  the heads of their building  fire and planning departments In theory  tens of thousands of these municipal officials could vote in the election  But people running busy departments have tended to let this duty fall off their radar  with many of those eligible to vote never signing up to take part  And of those who do sign up  some are chiefly concerned with provisions like fire safety  so they stop voting when they get to the energy provisions By now you may be wondering why all this is important  Because when so few people vote  groups opposed to improved building codes can gin up enough no votes to kill important measures   with long term consequences for all of us  I repeat  This is a central aspect of the energy policy for the entire country  routinely decided by fewer voters than might turn out for a New England town hall When the energy codes started  proponents of better buildings made some amazing gains  over the course of two code cycles a decade ago  projected energy use in buildings was cut by more than 30 percent  But the last two times the vote was held  important changes to the model building code were voted down  in some cases by relatively few votes And who would be against them  The National Association of Home Builders  This industry group always complains vociferously about requirements like newer window technology or better light fixtures that will drive up builders  costs by 1 or 2 percent  Of course the buyers of those houses would get the money back in a few short years through lower energy bills  a point the opponents rarely mention For the coming election  a coalition of experts focused on building efficiency is aiming for a minimum improvement of 10 percent  and hoping for more  Given how slow the building industry is to change  10 percent is a big number  The home builders are already organizing to try to block the effort So we need our communities to act  In particular  more than 400 American mayors have committed themselves to battling greenhouse emissions  If you are one of them  here is a concrete step  Make sure that your city or county agencies have paid their dues to the International Code Council  the group that runs this election  and that they intend to nominate voting representatives  The deadline to pay the dues is March 29  and if your jurisdiction does not sign up by then  it will not be able to cast votes this fall The measures themselves are pretty technical  so how can you tell which are good  Anybody planning to vote on the model code should follow the work of the Energy Efficient Codes Coalition  in Washington  which plans to offer advice on specific measures Once an improved model code is out next year  mayors should move to adopt it for their localities as quickly as possible  Yes  the local builders will whine  You can point out to them that we are trying to salvage a livable climate for our children and grandchildren  and we really need their help putting up less wasteful buildings The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips

The water is saved  for now Seven Western states have agreed on a plan to manage the Colorado River amid a 19 year drought  voluntarily cutting their water use to prevent the federal government from imposing a mandatory squeeze on the supply State water officials signed the deal on Tuesday after years of negotiations  forestalling what would have been the first federally enforced restrictions on the river s lower basin  But any victory may be short lived  Climate change promises to make the American West increasingly hot and dry  putting further pressure on the Colorado and the 40 million people who depend on its water  We all recognize we re looking at a drier future   said Tom Buschatzke  director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources The water in Lake Mead  the vast reservoir formed by the Hoover Dam that supplies the lower basin  has dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s  Lake Mead and Lake Powell  another reservoir on the river  are essential sources of water for Southern California and Arizona  and sit at less than 40 percent full  Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter  By the beginning of March  the water level in Lake Mead had dropped to 1 088 feet above sea level  At 1 075 feet  under guidelines agreed to in 2007  the federal government would declare a shortage on the lower Colorado River  and mandatory water restrictions would go into effect Without sacrifices by the states   Colorado  New Mexico  Utah and Wyoming in the upper basin  and Arizona  California and Nevada in the lower basin   the reservoir could reach the trigger point next year  though recent heavy snowfall in the mountains that feed the river may help for a time Brenda W  Burman  commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation  the federal agency that oversees the river  pressured states and their water agencies to make a deal  Without an agreement  she said  she would  take action to protect the river   without specifying what that action would be In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday  she said she was  pleased to see their hard work is done   The seven states and participating water districts sent a drought contingency plan to Congress  seeking legislation  for immediate implementation   according to a statement from the bureau ImageIntake pipes that once sat underwater on the banks of Lake Mead near Boulder City  Nev CreditJohn Locher Associated Press It s a hard to put together puzzle  all about sharing some burdens   said Sharon B  Megdal  director of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Arizona  The plan builds on water conservation efforts that have  for example  kept Southern California water use relatively flat for decades despite a population boom The Imperial Irrigation District  California s largest user of water from the river  threatened to derail the process when it demanded  200 million from the federal government to help restore the Salton Sea  the state s largest lake  But other state water districts said they would cover Imperial s share of water cuts without requiring that flows to the Salton Sea be reduced The Salton Sea is drying up in part because of measures taken by California farmers to use less water  which result in less runoff flowing into the lake  As it dries  fine dust from the lake bed blows into the air  which has been linked to childhood asthma and other illnesses Robert D  Schettler  a spokesman for the Imperial District  called the decision to move forward without its participation  unfortunate   adding that a pact without the Imperial District  may mean getting it done  but not getting it right  The federal government regulates the water  but the states own the rights to it  said Jennifer Pitt  an expert on river issues with the Audubon Society   So there s a tension there   she said   The federal government s consistent approach is to use that authority as a stick  but not ever go so far as to have to claim it  The river is important to the people who use its water  but also to  all of nature that depends on the river in the arid landscape of the Southwest   Ms  Pitt said Another big risk is that Lake Mead could eventually drop below 950 feet  when water could no longer turn the dam s turbines  or even 895 feet  when the lake would reach  deadpool  status and no water could flow out  That  said Patricia Aaron  a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Reclamation  need never happen   That s what the drought contingency planning on the river is about   she said Brad Udall  a senior scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on water supplies in the West  told a congressional panel last month that the lower basin uses about 10 2 million acre feet of water from the river each year  while upstream flows provide just nine million   An acre foot is the volume of one foot of water over one acre  about 325 000 gallons  Beyond that drain  climate change is bringing on a long term crisis   The Colorado River  and the entire Southwest  has shifted to a new hotter and drier climate  and  equally important  will continue to shift to a hotter and drier climate for several decades after we stop emitting greenhouse gases   he said in his testimony In an interview  Mr  Udall said the influence of climate change was already apparent in the West   Climate change is not some distant process   he said   It s here  it s now  it s in our faces  It s creating messes we have to deal with  Jonathan T  Overpeck  a climate scientist at the University of Michigan  said that politicians and policymakers needed to factor climate change into their plans  Lack of river water will lead people to pump more groundwater  which was deposited in the ice ages   We re using this fossil groundwater in unsustainable ways   he said In a warming world  Dr  Overpeck said  less water in rivers and lakes is inevitable  whatever relief a wet season might bring  But for the most part  Western political leaders  don t want to talk about it   he said   It is the disaster that s over the horizon  if we don t talk about it  For more news on climate and the environment  follow

Gloria Brown didn t get a good night s sleep  Her husband  Arthur Brown  79  has Alzheimer s disease and had spent most of the night pacing their bedroom  opening and closing drawers  and putting on and taking off his jacket So Ms  Brown  73  asked a friend to take her husband out for a few hours one recent afternoon so she could grab a much needed nap  She was lucky that day because she didn t need to call upon the home health aide who comes to their house twice a week Paying for help isn t cheap  The going rate in the San Francisco Bay Area  where the Browns live  ranges from  25 to  35 an hour  Ms  Brown estimates she has spent roughly  72 000 on caregivers  medications and supplies since her husband was given his diagnosis four years ago  The cost can be staggering   said Jim Patterson  a Republican state assemblyman from Fresno who is the author of a bill that would give family caregivers in California a tax credit of up to  5 000 annually to help offset their expenses A 2016 study by AARP found that the average caregiver spends  6 954 a year on out of pocket costs caring for a family member  The expenses range from  7 for medical wipes to tens of thousands of dollars to retrofit a home with a walk in shower or hire outside help AARP  a lobbying organization for people 50 and older  is pushing similar bills in at least seven other state legislatures this year  said Elaine Ryan  the group s vice president of state advocacy and strategy integration  Arizona  Illinois  Nebraska  New Jersey  New York  Rhode Island and Wisconsin are considering legislation  and AARP expects measures to be introduced in Florida  Massachusetts and Ohio In Wisconsin  two Republicans and two Democrats are behind that state s tax credit measure  We need a whole discussion about how we can best keep people at home and meet their needs   said state Representative Debra Kolste  a Democrat who explained that most people know someone who is caring for a family member  She hopes the measure can make it through the Republican legislature and be signed by Wisconsin s Democratic governor New Jersey approved a state income tax credit in 2017 specifically for caregivers of wounded veterans  However  efforts in other states have failed  including in Arizona last year and Mississippi and Virginia this year At the federal level  bills that would have created a federal income tax credit of up to  3 000 never got out of congressional committees last year  Whether I m in Billings  Mont   or in Mississippi  the caregiver tax credit is something that people are asking for   Ms  Ryan said   All they re asking for is a little financial help to offset these costs  A tax credit  said Ms  Brown and other caregivers  would be welcome relief to the estimated 4 5 million family caregivers in California who care for a loved one with a chronic  disabling or serious health condition  Nationwide  the AARP estimates there are about 40 million people caring for family members The Browns  who have been married 51 years and live in San Mateo  Calif   have good medical coverage  but like most seniors  they live on a fixed income As her husband s disease progresses  Ms  Brown expects costs to escalate  For instance  she wants to install bars in the bathroom to help prevent her husband from falling  and anticipates she will need more professional help  I think we re just moving into that stage where I m going to see the dollars going out for things that will help to make things easier for him at home and more comfortable   Ms  Brown said   It s a cost you just hadn t anticipated  Long term caregiving has emerged as one of the major issues in California s Capitol this year  with proposals ranging from naming a state  Aging Czar  to funding a new cash benefit for long term care services  In his State of the State address last month  Gov  Gavin Newsom called for a master plan for aging  I ve had some personal   and painful   experience with this recently   Mr  Newsom told the joint session of the legislature Mr  Newsom  whose father had dementia and died last year  also has tapped former first lady Maria Shriver to lead a new Alzheimer s Prevention and Preparedness Task Force  and has asked lawmakers to approve  3 million in state funds for Alzheimer s disease research Mr  Patterson s bill would provide up to a  5 000 state income tax credit to family caregivers for five years  starting in tax year 2020  They would be reimbursed for 50 percent of eligible expenses  such as retrofitting a home  hiring an aide and leasing or buying specialty equipment  The credit would be available to individuals who make up to  170 000 a year  or joint income tax filers who make up to  250 000 Mr  Patterson  a Republican in the minority  is hopeful he can convince his colleagues that giving people a tax credit is financially sound because it would enable caregivers to keep their loved ones at home rather than relying on more expensive government services  If members of the legislature and the governor would look through the eyes of their own families  friends and neighbors   I think it can be passed and be signed   Mr  Patterson said But the measure faces competition for a slice of California s  21 billion surplus  from proposals by the governor and lawmakers to increase funding for education  health care  housing and dozens of other programs For Pam Sogge of Oakland  Calif   a tax credit would allow her to hire a home health aide for an additional three hours a week Her husband  Rick Sogge  61  has early onset Alzheimer s and becomes frantic when left by himself  Sometimes when she leaves him alone in another room of their home  he searches for her every two minutes Because Mr  Sogge is still physically healthy  most of the couple s caregiving expenses are for part time help to take him on outings so his wife can work  run errands or go to the doctor s office  You have a very uncertain financial future  You don t know what s going to happen  You don t know how long it s going to take  So you re very conservative   said Ms  Sogge  56  who has been caring for her husband for five years   A tax credit  in a way  it s permission and encouragement to get some help  This story was produced by Kaiser Health News  KHN   which publishes California Healthline  an editorially independent service of the California

On Tuesday the designer and filmmaker Tom Ford was the second highest trending topic on Twitter for a reason that had nothing to do with the actual news he was making He was trending because of a quote that had been attributed to him stating Melania Trump was a  glorified escort  and that he was refusing to dress her  His office  however  was quick to point out that he had never said any such thing  Rather  in a 2016 interview on  The View   he said that  at one pre campaign time  he had been approached to dress Mrs  Trump  but he declined because she wasn t  really his image  and besides  he believed the first lady should wear American and wear affordable   and his clothes were neither of those things This matters not so much because it is yet another example of the nefarious ways false information spreads over the internet  though it is that  but because on Tuesday Mr  Ford also became chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America  the industry lobbying group  watchdog and  occasionally  scapegoat  That makes him the effective face of the industry  And that means that what he says  or what he is said to have said  and what he stands for  will become even more fraught  because he no longer simply speaks for himself  but for American fashion  He succeeds Diane von Furstenberg  who held the post for 13 years  making her the second longest serving leader in the group s history  her predecessor  Stan Herman  lasted 16 years    People keep saying to me   Why did you agree to do this    Mr  Ford said on a call from Los Angeles  where he is based   The answer is  Out of a sense of duty  I guess  At a certain point in your life you ve learned enough and done enough  you should share what you know  I think that sense of giving back is very American  It s certainly much less a European thing  I think I can do a good job and I think I have a vision for it  so why not add it to my list of things to do  It s an interesting time to add the CFDA to a to do list that includes women s wear  men s wear  beauty  accessories and filmmaking  The lack of racial diversity at many fashion brands is still very much an issue  Calvin Klein  once a tent pole of American style  just announced it was closing its designer led Collection line  there s a general sense of an identity crisis at New York Fashion Week as young designers jump ship for other cities or decide to sit seasons out  and everyone is worried about the future of department stores  once the style conduits to the country  Not to mention the fact that fashion still has a somewhat fractious relationship with the current presidential administration  Diane approached me and then Anna approached me and then Steven approached me and then Diane approached me and then Anna approached me and then Steven approached me   said Mr  Ford  referring to Ms  von Furstenberg  Anna Wintour  the editor of Vogue and artistic director of Condé Nast  and Steven Kolb  chief executive of the CFDA  I was courted for awhile   Mr  Ford said  The hard sell reflects both the seriousness of the job and the complications of taking it on at this time  They put a heavier onus on what could be a ceremonial position  and mean it will be incumbent on Mr  Ford to articulate some sort of way forward for the industry and the CFDA s 495 members As to what  exactly  that way forward might be  however  he declined to go into detail until his term officially starts in June  after the organization s annual fashion awards  nominations were just released  and the fact that Sander Lak of Sies Marjan is in the running for women s wear designer of the year  when last year he won emerging designer  reflects the general confusion   What Mr  Ford would say was that he felt his international background   his years as creative director of Gucci and  later  Yves Saint Laurent from 1990 to 2004  his time based in London with his own brand from 2010 to 2016   would inform his message Tom Ford  Spring 201947 PhotosView Slide Show  ImageNowfashion I think the key to the future of American fashion is to become more international and more global   Mr  Ford said   Having recently returned to America  one of the things that struck me the most in every industry and in American life was how isolated America was and how inward looking  I ve always thought of myself as an international designer  designing to a global market  and I think that American fashion needs to think that way  Even if you re just starting a business you have to be immediately thinking about what s going to help you be marketable to the world  and not just to America  And even more than that   not just to New York  Although the CFDA is based in Manhattan  Mr  Ford  who has been a member since 2000 and has won seven CFDA awards  including the lifetime achievement prize in 2014  has no plans to move  or to be in the city more than the  four or five times  a year he currently visits  He also has no plans to make himself an example of a designer who recommits to New York Fashion Week on a long term basis  I have a global business and sometimes I may need to show in another country   he said  he has shown in London and Los Angeles    Sometimes I may need to show in Asia  I may need to show in Europe  I was very honest and upfront about that  But I think the CFDA is an American thing and not so much a New York thing   Arguably New York is the center of a certain America  and I realize part of the CFDA is organizing and   I don t want to say policing   New York Fashion Week  But it is also encouraging American designers to be successful and part of that is embracing the fact we live in a big world   he said It s an interesting statement  and one that verges on the political in a time when the fight over a border wall has been one of the defining discussions of the year  Under Ms  von Furstenberg  the CFDA lobbied for greater intellectual property protections for designers  embarked on a model health initiative  raised the volume on the conversation about diversity and inclusion  and brought new American designers to Paris for a fashion week showcase  Now it is up to Mr  Ford to choose his issues and decide how to direct his new cast  I m pretty steel willed   he said 
WEDNESDAY PUZZLE   I ll let you in on a little secret  Crossword puzzles that are accepted for publication are not necessarily published in the order in which they get the  Crossword   Yes   email from our editors  If a constructor has submitted multiple puzzles and the editors decide that the third submission is needed more than the first for some reason  the third one will see the light of day first Maybe that s not really a secret  but it explains the notes from the constructors Amanda Chung and Karl Ni below Now do this puzzle as fast as you can  Crosswords are so ephemeral  you know Tricky Clues1A   What you might do if you skip a step  sounds  on the surface  like the answer should be something like RETURN IT TO IKEA AND CLAIM THAT IT WAS BROKEN WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT  but that would never fit  I knew we were looking at a clue that was hinting at actually skipping a stair on a staircase  so at first I had FALL  then SLIP  Neither worked  The answer is TRIP 10A  The entry AVA has appeared in the New York Times Crossword puzzle 435 times  12 of which were about the director Ava DuVernay  Now that Ms  DuVernay has become a staple of our crossword  I decided it was time to inaugurate her into a very special club 14A  Hi  kids  Back in the 1960s and 1970s editions of the golden age of television  you couldn t swing a ukulele without running into the singer DON HO on someone s variety show  including his own  Mr  HO was known for his ballad crooning  as well as for being Hawaii s  Ambassador of Aloha  to the world  Around these parts  he is primarily known for getting flagged because of his surname  If any of you need me  I ll be picking comments out of the spam filter for the rest of the day 31A   Part of a Swiss roll   refers to a roll of cash  not the dessert  The answer is FRANC 61A  If something is  Off the table   it usually means that the idea or item is no longer going to be discussed or part of a negotiation  I am in possession of a teenage young man  so if it s off the table  it s been EATEN 1D  Hmm  Please see Mr  Erik Agard s notes below  I hope I m wrong  too 8D  Hi again  kids  The classic 1931 film  The Champ  was most notable for starring Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper  a child star who grew up to play  among many other roles  Perry White in the  Superman  film series from the 1970s and 1980s  where he   you know what  Just remember that Wallace Beery was in  The Champ  15D   Jabberwocky  was a wonderful work by Lewis Carroll  The contraction that starts it is  of course   TWAS  TWAS brillig  and the slithy tovesDid gyre and gimble in the wabe All mimsy were the borogoves  And the mome raths outgrabe 18D  Pro tip   If you have a four letter entry and the clue is about oil or spots  you can be pretty sure that the answer will be ACNE or ZITS  In this puzzle  it s ACNE 26D  Hi  kids  me again  Ralph Nader is a lawyer and a four time presidential candidate who has been involved in such political causes as consumer protection  environmentalism and government reform  More recently  you might have heard his name bandied about when your parents were discussing the advantages and disadvantages of third party voting  And he s still hard at work  56D  Did you think the clue was hinting at a gas filling station   Letters at a filling station   does not refer to M P G  It hints at another place where you might get a filling  the dentist s office  The answer is D D S Today s ThemeI got the idea of this theme fairly quickly  as I was solving around the bottom of the grid and got the revealer at 56A  DISAPPEARING INK  We all loved the disappearing ink prank when we were children   it s much harder to pull off when your main method of written communication is a keyboard   but what does it have to do with the theme  The theme entries  denoted by asterisks  are a seemingly arbitrary and somewhat odd list of phrases It turns out that the liquid DISAPPEARING INK revealer is telling us to look for the word  INK   which slowly fades as you go from top to bottom  For example  the top theme entry at 16A is  Insomniac s complaint   which is clued straight  I CAN T SLEEP A WINK includes the full word INK at the end  Similarly  23A  KITCHEN SIN  which is tough to parse  even with the clue   drops the letter K  The rest of the answers drop the N  then the I  and the last theme entry has none of those letters at all  which means the INK has disappeared completely  I found that confusing at first  because it leaves us with a somewhat awkward entry  MAKES YOUTH for the phrase  makes you think   but I guess it makes sense  HOT P I   for the phrase   hot pink   felt arbitrary to me Overall  I liked the concept but kept wishing that the resulting phrases after the letters were removed were slightly more in the language  Constructor NotesAmanda Chung and Karl Ni  This is our first puzzle ever accepted by The New York Times  after Erik jump started our construction efforts  We received the news when we were in Oregon  watching the total solar eclipse  Amanda still remembers the email  which Will Shortz closed with  Welcome aboard   Among the clues  we can appreciate the pair of nods to California along with the lead into  Jabberwocky   one of Karl s favorite poems Erik Agard  Of the clues not written by us  my favorite is 31 Across  I wish I had thought of that  I m unsure about 1D   I fear that  making  implies that those groups had more agency in the historical creation of that system than they actually did  or that the     at the end of the clue is a bit too flippant for the subject matter  I hope I m wrong  Thanks to Amanda and Karl for helping turn an O K  idea into a great idea  as they always do The Tipping PointAlmost finished solving but need a bit more help  We

BERLIN   At first glance  it s an image we all know  the pale column of a World Trade Center tower against a bright blue sky  with a billow of mottled smoke in a floating plume  On the right  a tiny plane hovers like a buzzing fly  foretelling the tragedy that would follow But  look a little closer  and you ll see that  this time  the plane is held up by strings  The noxious cloud is made of cotton wool  and the grid of windows isn t quite straight  And is that antenna made of   paper  As the eye travels outward  a glue stick  aerosol can and lighting rig all come into view  giving away the real story of how this image came about Jojakim Cortis and Adrian Sonderegger s series  Icons   a selection of which is currently showing at the C O Berlin photography gallery  restages famous photographs  using precise model making techniques  Each of their photos includes the tools involved and detritus accumulated in making these 3 D dioramas  some of which take months to complete ImageAdrian Sonderegger  left  and Jojakim Cortis in the C O Berlin gallery on March 15 CreditMustafah Abdulaziz for The New York Times From the beginning of our collaboration  we were interested in fiction and reality   said Mr  Sonderegger  on a tour of the exhibition  titled  Double Take  and running through June 1  ahead of its opening  The Swiss duo said they were particularly interested in historically significant shots  like the one taken from a helicopter flying over Lower Manhattan on Sept  11  2001  showing United Airlines Flight 175 fly toward the South Tower of the World Trade Center   A lot of images are really like a symbol for a change of something   Mr  Sonderegger said   If you look at the history  you see that this image stands for this period  or for the end of this period  The pair s choice of photographs reflects this focus  For example  one recreates a shot of the tsunami that hit Southeast Asia in 2004  using epoxy resin  plastic wrap and feathers  another the shallow crater made by a boot on the moon  the artists  own Converse footprints marking the border of the mock up  Each of these images had a momentous effect on the international audiences that saw them  The first one  on our understanding of natural disasters and their impact on human settlements  the second  for our awareness of our place in the universe Image Making of Tsunami  by Unknown Tourist  2004     2015  by Cortis and Sonderegger  recreates a shot of the tsunami that hit Southeast Asia in 2004 CreditCortis   SondereggerMr  Cortis and Mr  Sonderegger s images fascinate partly because of the interplay between what we see in front of us and how we remember the original  At the same time  the lighting rigs  paint cans and dirty paintbrushes remind us that it s all an illusion  At a time when digital photographic manipulation is a fact of life  these images remind us that a photograph is not an objective representation of the events it depicts  And perhaps  sometimes  seeing shouldn t be believing Here are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr  Cortis and Mr  Sonderegger  discussing a selection of original photos they chose  along with their recreations

You only have the sand and the footprint  ADRIAN SONDEREGGER I think the boundary s very important because it s the transition from reality to fiction  and you don t know which one is which CORTIS We tried out different kinds of materials  If you use normal sand  it s too big  So in the end we used cement  which is really fine  And the footprint was hard   we had to do it in one movement  I don t know how many times SONDEREGGER Over 100 times  The Converse footprints weren t planned  it just happened  But we thought it might be good   it s an iconic shoe CORTIS For us the work is not about conspiracy theories  but people love this discussion  It s probably also the reason why the work is successful  because it s a theme that s so contemporary  Making of Abu Ghraib   2014 Based on a photograph by Sabrina Harman  2003ImageCreditvia Associated PressImageCreditCortis   SondereggerCORTIS We had to choose one  because there s more than one image from these events  But for us  because of this connection to the original definition of  iconic   from religion  it was clear we should use this one This is a doll  We had to modify it  to break the arms and legs  which sounds a little bit brutal SONDEREGGER At the beginning we just work on the image  but at the end we check everything  We re photographers   if there s something that s not working for us  then we move it  Making of

of the iconic photographs of our time  Also  there is always the discussion of if it s a fake or not  Robert Capa hadn t taken a lot of photographs on the film and it was missing for a long time  A lot of people have researched this  On the other hand  you don t have proof that it s a fake  I think this always gets the discussion rolling It s just a very good image  It stands for Robert Capa  who said something like   If you don t have a good image  you haven t been close enough   CORTIS Actually it s funny because we had it in landscape orientation at the beginning  We were further away  So we thought about what Capa said  You have to go closer At the beginning  our earlier images  there were no people in them  Figures are always hard SONDEREGGER This one is made from plasteline  which is baked to make it hard  You can see  it s not perfect  We are perfectionists  but on the other hand  we know it s good that it s not perfect CORTIS If it s perfect then you don t have the connection to the tools  Making of Black Power Salute   2017 Based on a photograph by John Dominis  1968ImageCreditJohn Dominis Associated PressImageCreditCortis   SondereggerSONDEREGGER For a book we published last summer  we thought about time periods and different fields in the history of photography  and we found we didn t have anything from sports  This image is political  and at the same time you don t see any action CORTIS Also there s a story behind the image  The reason they only have one glove each is because one   John Carlos  who won the bronze medal in the race   forgot his  so they shared a pair  I read that the photographer wasn t aware of what was really happening when he took the image SONDEREGGER You see how they are made   but that s only from one side  CORTIS I also like this emptiness you have above the fist  A lot of images we do  there s a little bit of humor in it  The other shoe has to be somewhere 
Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   The Obama administration violated federal law by failing to adequately take into account the climate change impact of leasing public land for oil gas drilling in Wyoming  a federal judge ruled Tuesday But the decision by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia could also present a legal threat to President Trump s agenda to quickly expand oil and gas drilling and coal mining across the nation s public lands and waters  That s because the decision amounts to a road map that could be used to challenge hundreds of Trump administration leases as well  However  experts said that  while the decision could lead to legal delays for the drilling expansion envisioned by Mr  Trump by tangling them in litigation  it was unlikely to halt it entirely Tuesday s decision by Judge Rudolph Contreras  which applied specifically to an Obama era plan by the Interior Department s Bureau of Land Management to lease several thousand acres of land for drilling in Wyoming  also concluded that the agency was legally required to consider the climate impact of all such lease sales for fossil fuel development  This is the first court ruling that specifically tears apart the Interior Department s failure to take into account the climate change of impact on drilling  on a national scale   said Jeremy Nichols  the climate change and energy program director for WildEarth Guardians In his decision  Judge Contreras wrote that  under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970  federal agencies are required to consider and quantify the effect of the possible planet warming emissions associated with the fossil fuels to be extracted from the sales of such leases  Already  that law requires the federal government to consider the on site environmental effects of oil and gas drilling  such as water pollution and the effects on plants and animals of road construction   What this decision says is  in evaluating the environmental consequences of the lease  an agency has to look not just at the consequences of the impacts immediately surrounding the lease but also the consequences down the road of burning the fuel once it s extracted   said Richard L  Revesz  an expert on environmental law at New York University   That s enormously important   The Bureau of Land Management protested that it  would be required to identify any past  present  or reasonably foreseeable greenhouse emitting projects worldwide   an  impossible  scope of analysis Judge Contreras wrote that the agency was correct in that the law  does not require the impossible   But he wrote   In short  BLM did not adequately quantify the climate change impacts of oil and gas leasing   In general  the Trump administration s proposed lease sales for oil and gas drilling have included less climate impact analysis than the Obama era ones that were the focus of Judge Contreras s decision A spokeswoman for the Interior Department declined to respond to questions about the decision  saying the agency did not comment on ongoing litigation  A spokeswoman for the Western Energy Alliance  a coalition of fossil fuel companies that joined with the Interior Department in the case  called the decision  ripe for successful appeal    The judge is asking BLM to take a wild guess at how many wells would be developed on these leases and analyze greenhouse gas impacts for wells that will never be developed   said the spokeswoman  Kathleen Sgamma  But other experts said that Judge Contreras s requirement was not particularly onerous for companies   It s not a very time consuming calculation   said Mr  Revesz of New York University   It s based on models that already exist    The court is saying  you have to go back and take a harder look at the climate impacts   said Harry Weiss  an expert in natural resources law at the firm Ballard Spahr   But they re also saying if they do a heck of job on figuring it out  then they can go back and drill  For more news on climate and the environment  follow  NYTClimate on Twitter 
If Dave Attell ever retires  as he has periodically hinted for years  what will become of club comedy Comics will still work clubs  of course  But in an era when the savvy career move is to diversify into podcasts and video while playing a variety of rooms  Attell  54  is the rare elite stand up who advertises himself  with a mixture of pride and self deprecation  as simply a club comic  More important  No one alive makes a better argument for the aesthetic of New York club comedy  with its tussling crowd work  quick setups and ruthless punch lines that go for the gut For 32 years  he has performed nearly every night of the week  making him a longer running fixture in this city than  The Phantom of the Opera   and one that has aged better  although you might not know it at first glance On a cold weeknight this month at the Comedy Cellar  where he often appears on the late show  he walked onstage looking rumpled  sporting a baggy winter coat and a headwear situation that resembled a Russian nesting doll  After removing a hoodie that covered his customary black baseball cap  which he took off to reveal yet another hat  he began his set with a knowing quip   I look like I just came here to get warm  Attell has been describing himself like this for decades   I have a gym in my building   he said in his 1996 HBO half hour   Does anyone else live in the Y  Attell actually has had a successful showbiz career  which includes host of cult shows on Comedy Central   Insomniac   and Showtime   Dave s Old Porn    along with brief stints on  The Daily Show  and  Saturday Night Live   But he s more revered by peers than the public  He has never put out specials as frequently as he could have  His easygoing double act   Bumping Mics  with Jeff Ross  which debuted last fall on Netflix  was his first release since 2014 What Attell does best doesn t lead to fame and fortune these days  It s not just that he s an old school performer in a media landscape biased toward novelty and provocation  Making noise in the crowded comedy scene today means going personal  political or controversial  Attell generally avoids all three  You can watch him for hours and learn next to nothing about his life or his deepest convictions outside an abiding faith in punchy jokes He has one of the quickest minds in comedy  and gently insulting audiences is critical to his act  adding tension  unpredictability and a change of pace  At a terrific 90 minute or so show in December at Caroline s  where I sat in the front row  he treated me like a speed bag  jabbing me with punch lines about my glasses   Isaac Asimov s grandson    posture   Stephen Hawking s stunt double   and snack food preference  When I said rice cracker  he responded   What s your favorite porn   homework  At his core  Attell is a high octane  no frills joke machine  a delivery system for punch lines  some improvised  but a vast majority rigorously honed  With a compulsive work ethic  he tests the same jokes for years  tweaking words repeatedly to find the funniest sound  He doesn t add many act outs to sell a line or weave bits into a story to build comic momentum  If you transcribe his jokes and read them aloud flatly  they remain funny His comedy doesn t carry a message  but it does have a specific mood and texture that has shifted over the years  He built his reputation on a dirty and dissolute image  focusing on sex toys  drinking and ornate literary descriptions of testicles   My favorite might be when he compared them to a  tent no one knows how to fold up   If you listen closely to his 2014 Comedy Central special   Road Work   you can hear the roots of some of the button pushing humor of Louis C K   albeit in quicker form   Ever do a bunch of mushrooms  think you re having a pillow fight  but it turns out to be a live baby   goes one joke Attell isn t as raunchy as he once was  As he has gotten older  he has added more jokes about food and pets  He will still predict how a night might end for audience members based on what they re drinking  but now that he s sober  there aren t as many punch lines about Jägermeister He has his off nights  and his crowd work can be tentative   Jeff Ross is a good match  prodding him to take more risks   But there are moments when I see Attell perform that I think he is only now entering his prime  something this famously self critical comic would probably disagree with Stick around long enough  and you acquire a certain gravitas  no matter how ragged and unpretentious you may be  Attell is far too wedded to the economical structure of hard jokes to veer off into the poetic flourishes of Dave Chappelle  and he seems to have little interest in waging culture wars But see him perform enough  and a theme emerges  close attention paid to the lonely and overlooked figures of our society  particularly in an unforgiving city  He has a wonderful bit imagining the guy who sells fruit on Sixth Avenue at 4 a m  and another extended metaphor in which he pictures himself carrying a lantern through a thick fog  saying  fog things  like  Friend or foe  His material has the landscape of a Tom Waits song  crusty and cynical  inspiring bleak laughter that sounds as if it might turn into a cough at any moment  Attell has built a comic world that perfectly fits the character he has long played onstage  one with a past he can plumb for a few extra laughs Around midnight at the Comedy Cellar another night this month  Attell invited his audience to imagine the loneliness of a worker making Subway sandwiches in an empty restaurant  After setting the scene more economically than I have  with him waiting for his food  he describes watching this employee and deciding to make  his smallest dream come true  With a conspiratorial glance to one side  he said   Take the gloves off   Then he hit the audience with two more punch lines  instructing this sad sack to live his best life   Raw dog it  Put the mayonnaise wherever you want  Like New York itself  Dave Attell is not as dirty as he used to be  but he can still make a joke about cold cuts sound deliriously filthy 
LONDON   Wrapped in a turban and a mink lined robe  the old man sits in his opulent home  smiling wryly  The pouch in his hand is full to bursting  Gold coins are scattered across his desk The elderly figure is pictured at the center of a board game called the New and Fashionable Game of the Jew  which was popular in early 19th century England  An 1807 original is on view at an exhibition running through July 7 at the Jewish Museum in London called  Jews  Money  Myth   The show explores the ways in which Jews have been associated with money over the past 2 000 years Displays include objects that belonged to British Jews   buried medieval coins  tally sticks used as proof of loans  soup kitchen tokens   and representations of Jews in painting  in literature  such as Shakespeare s  The Merchant of Venice  and Charles Dickens s  Oliver Twist   in caricatures  and in fascist propaganda The Jewish Museum s aim is to  debunk a lot of the myths that still circulate today   said Joanne Rosenthal  the exhibition s curator   such as Jews exerting a kind of sinister influence on world events  Jews financing disastrous wars around the world for profit  Jews being naturally drawn to money making  ImageThe New and Fashionable Game of the Jew was was based on a medieval gambling pastime  The winner was the one who rolled the highest numbers and collected the most tokens CreditJewish Museum LondonThese centuries old  tropes and stereotypes  still circulate on social media and beyond  Ms  Rosenthal added  and the exhibition invites visitors to look in a  calm and levelheaded way at the historical realities  The show opens amid signs of a resurgence of anti Semitism in Europe  In a 12 country survey of Jewish respondents last year by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights  89 percent said anti Semitism was on the rise  France reported a 74 percent surge in anti Semitic acts last year  and President Emmanuel Macron said in February that anti Semitism was at a postwar peak In Britain  there were  1 652 anti Semitic incidents in 2018  up 16 percent from the year before  according to the Community Security Trust  an organization that monitors anti Semitism in the country The opposition Labour Party in Britain has expelled a dozen members since last April as it investigates 673 complaints of anti Semitism  Since 2015  numerous members have been expelled or suspended for making anti Semitic remarks publicly or on social media  or for joining hate groups  A 2016 inquiry concluded that there was an  occasionally toxic atmosphere  in the party The  Jews  Money  Myth  exhibition is the brainchild of the Jewish Museum s chief executive  Abigail Morris  who took over in 2012 and has since programmed a string of popular exhibitions  In 2015  she staged a show on the subject of blood in the Jewish religion and culture  a sensitive theme  But for many  the issue of Jews and money has proved far more unsettling  Ms  Morris said ImageA figurine from Poland  made in 2018  Many such pieces have been produced in Poland in recent decades CreditJewish Museum London I ve never done anything in my life where people have been so scared   she said in an interview at the museum   Even the title scares people  She and her team noticed  a real shift  in anti Jewish sentiment over the last two or three years  Ms  Morris said  Negative comments were now constant  rather than sporadic and linked to news coverage of Israel  she noted   My contention is  it s there  it s getting bigger   she said   Not drawing attention to it won t make it go away  The exhibition draws primarily on the museum s own collection of historical objects from Britain  though there are also many from elsewhere in Europe  It opens with an entry from the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary that lists one of the definitions of the word  jew  as a verb meaning  to cheat  The myth of Jews and money can be traced back to the biblical figure of Judas  who betrayed Christ in exchange for some silver coins  In the show s star attraction  Rembrandt s  Judas Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver   on loan from a private collection  Judas is pictured on his knees  begging a group of priests for forgiveness The exhibition then recounts the arrival of the first Jews to England  soon after the Norman Conquest in 1066  Some worked in money lending and finance  One of the displays has a claim to being the world s earliest anti Jewish caricature  a doodle at the top of a 1233 record for taxes paid by Jews in Norwich  England  It depicts the wealthy Isaac of Norwich  a local money lender  as a three headed Antichrist figure ImageA poster produced in 1900 for the Musée des Horreurs in France depicting James de Rothschild  who founded the French branch of the family bank and was a prominent figure in French society at the time CreditUnited States Holocaust Memorial MuseumBy the 19th century  Jews were regularly portrayed as beggars or poverty stricken peddlers   the exhibition describes how most Jews in England at that time were economic migrants with limited financial means who were forced to scrape together a living any way they could Conversely  Jews were also portrayed as greedy bankers  One of the financiers who came in for much negative representation was Nathan Mayer Rothschild  who arrived from Germany in 1798  opened his namesake bank soon after  and went on to finance British military campaigns The exhibition includes an 1837 portrait of Rothschild   as well as an 1829 caricature depicting him as an overweight figure with a sack of money slung over his shoulder  titled   The Man Wot Knows How to Drive a Bargain  As well as historical items   Jews  Money  Myth  features two works of contemporary art specially commissioned for the exhibition  including one by a Turner Prize winner  Jeremy Deller  Mr  Deller s contribution is a film  a compilation of excerpts from homemade propaganda videos from the United States and Europe  cartoons  televangelist programs  presidential speeches and political campaign ads  all of which make oblique or overt references to Jews and money The video also features campaigners in favor of Britain s withdrawal from the European Union  who were filmed outside the Houses of Parliament in London recently  One of the protesters holds a placard that equates the Jewish financier George Soros and the Rothschilds with the European Union  saying they run Britain s  fake news  television channels ImageAn image from a Nazi propaganda book for children from

of the Holocaust and Genocide  London If you go down to Parliament Square  you don t have to try too hard or wait around too long before you see or maybe hear someone talking about Jews   Mr  Deller said in an interview  Anti Semitism  is here  It s very much on the streets  Pictured in his film and elsewhere in the exhibition is a 2012 mural in the East End of London that shows six elderly financiers seated around a Monopoly board that rests on the backs of what appear to be naked slaves  When the mural s creator complained of its removal by local authorities in 2012  he was defended on Facebook by the Labour leader Mr  Corbyn  stoking the criticism of his party s attitudes toward Jews  Mr  Corbyn later apologized and said he had not examined the image closely  describing the mural as  deeply disturbing and anti Semitic  David Feldman  a professor of history at Birkbeck  University of London who is director of the Pears Institute for the Study of Anti Semitism  which was consulted for the exhibition   said the left sometimes did not initially identify certain patterns of behavior as racist or anti Semitic Jews are  predominantly a middle class population in Britain  so they don t fit the idea of what a victim of racism ought to look like   Professor Feldman said   There is an expectation that the victims of racism are people of color  that they re poor  and that in the case of Europe  either they or their forebears were colonial subjects  Professor Feldman added that anti Jewish sentiment was creeping more into the mainstream  We have a situation in which people with anti Semitic views are becoming bolder and more visible   he said   It is this which creates concern  
SURVIVAL MATH Notes on an All American Family By Mitchell S  JacksonIn a conversation published in Essence magazine in 1984  Audre Lorde and James Baldwin engaged in an impassioned debate centered on the plight of black people living under the weight of racism in America  Baldwin thought Lorde was too hard on black men   who he argued are beset by racism in exceptionally pernicious ways   when she criticized their treatment of black girls and women  Lorde was as concerned about misogyny as racism  but Baldwin demanded to know how she could  blame the black man for a situation which has nothing to do with him   Ever the master of black feminist poetics  Lorde was also a sage who knew how to reframe fragile arguments into teachable observations   I m not interested in blame   she said   I m interested in changing  This was Lorde s challenge  her mandate to black male writers  an insistence that black men reckon with both racism and their complicity in patriarchy  Mitchell S  Jackson s memoir   Survival Math   is his response ImageMitchell S  Jackson CreditJohn RicardJackson s work is a model of autobiographical writing that demonstrates how reportage and critical attention to the complexities of black life   its intersectional textures   can be the source material for an inimitable memoir  He offers an account of his own family s existence in Oregon  a predominantly white state where  until 1926  it was still illegal for black people to take up residence  Jackson s maternal great grandparents  Mama Edie and Bubba  would later make their home in a  white house the size of a small palace  on the corner of Sixth and Mason in Portland after the exclusionary law was overturned  Like so many other black people  Jackson s progenitors  transformed themselves   in no small part by forging lives for themselves outside of the South   into as much of a nation as they have ever been  it seems sometimes into as much of one as they may ever be  in the Other America  Jackson s story of a black family living in Oregon feels particularly timely  He grew up surrounded by the kind of white  working class and overlooked people who make up Donald Trump s base and have been seen as responsible for his rise   Survival Math  reminds us that a place like Oregon  where part of that  Other America  lives  is not uniformly white  Black people are also part of its history  And their quests to live  survive and be remembered are as worthy of book length treatments as those of their white counterparts   This book was one of our most anticipated titles of March  See the full list   Throughout  Survival Math   Jackson writes with a keen attentiveness to the social contexts shaping the lives of his family  offering nuanced depictions that upend the stereotypes that often cage us in  His is  after all   the generation of babies born and raised in the  70s and  80s whose lives were transformed by an unprecedented phenomenological portent  We being the first generation of crack dealers who were the children of crack addicts   Some of his family members were indeed crack dealers and crack addicts  some were also pimps  gangbangers and prostitutes  And he pairs the vivid everyday insights of those black people   especially those imagined as incapable of depth  of appreciating virtue and its manifestations   with those of lauded white philosophers and theorists  like Plato  Kant and Baudelaire Jackson refuses to describe his people as lacking love or being unworthy of love  In one of many heartbreaking scenes  he recalls the death of his aunt Essie Carie Jackson  who was a prostitute  She was murdered at a young age  but he describes her as a  beloved aunt  cousin  sister  daughter  mother   It takes courage not to shy away from writing what is true   even when the truth is painful  In his notes  Jackson writes to his  fam  to justify including the story of Essie s life and tragic murder  He laments that  it ain t easy writing about folks you love and about the loved ones of folks you love  There s often a decision between protecting who you love and protecting the integrity of what you set out to do  ImageJackson characterizes neither his people nor himself as perfect  but at the same time he refuses to treat them as disposable  He exposes their inner lives  then approaches them with radical love  And to love  as Jackson seems to understand  is to avoid lying  So he grapples honestly  for instance  with the role of the father figures in his life   I had a father   he writes   because I made one  Or rather  I composed a father from the men at hand  brothers who kept me long before Obama made it a project   His composite father consisted of his mother s boyfriend Big Chris  his maternal grandfather  Sam  his maternal uncle  Anthony  his basketball coach Dixon  and his biological father  Wesley  Yet their part in raising and mentoring Jackson did not mean these men always made the best choices  He is clear that  not a single man I mentioned has existed in my life beyond critique   Nor has Jackson himself existed beyond critique  and he freely admits to being  a flawed human striving  striving  One of the most striking facets of Jackson s book is the way he bares himself   and here he most clearly answers Audre Lorde s request of black men to commit to internal work that can result in change and accountability  Jackson  like his contemporary Kiese Laymon  author of the recent memoir  Heavy   has produced a work that faces this task head on  work Jackson refers to as  revision   He seeks to determine  if it s possible to apply the skills for revising the page to revising a life  and if that revision or revisioning could transform what someone had misperceived or forecasted as their fate  His book is a testament that revision is not only possible but necessary  Where Jackson demonstrates this most plainly is in his worthy decision to include  victim statements  from five of his previous intimate partners  who attest to the ways he too has oppressed  The result is unlike anything readers may have come upon before in a memoir  a stunning move from blame to an honest calculation of how one black man s actions and inactions hurt the black women he claimed to love  The epilogue  which is a letter to Jackson s daughter  Justice  is bountiful in sweetness  but it too contains the words of a person who has come to realize that the inheritances we leave   our presences  absences  lies  gifts  hurts  truths   are never passed along without consequences  The choices we make  the manipulations and contortions we go through in order to survive in these United States  are always shaped by what the scholar Saidiya Hartman has described  in her book  Lose Your Mother   as an entrenched  racial calculus and a political arithmetic   Survival Math  makes it clear that blackness is never a deficit  And yet as Jackson reminds us  even those of us who are black men must be certain not to rely on a computational system  steeped in anti black racist patriarchy  to save ourselves while harming others 
GENEVA   In his business manual  Relationology   the author and international speaker Matt Bird wrote that  the true currency of business is relationships  not money   It s a slogan the new generation of watch chief executives seem to have taken to heart For example  Louis Ferla  the 44 year old chief executive of Vacheron Constantin said   Of course  success is financial  but there is also human success   he said   Watches are the fruits of a human adventure   so it s about the human touch  Mr  Ferla said Vacheron Constantin had about 1 200 global employees  but it s the individuals that make up a company work force   Ten years from now   he said   you will remember if your boss and your colleagues were inspiring  if you had a good time  if you learned things  or whether you went to the office with a knot in your stomach   more than whether you got your X percent increase  How has this played out at the company s Geneva headquarters   I don t have any ego   Mr  Ferla said   I often say to my colleagues that they can say no if they disagree  What should prevail is the best idea  not your role or your job title  We can argue on almost everything   what I don t want us to argue about is having to improve  Mr  Ferla  who is French  entered the Richemont group in 2001 and worked for Dunhill and Cartier in Hong Kong  Taiwan  the United Arab Emirates and China before joining Vacheron Constantin in 2016  He became the Geneva company s chief executive the next year and was one of the first of a new wave of Richemont brand heads  ushered in after Johann Rupert  the group s chairman  told his board in late 2016 he wanted to see fewer  gray men  running his companies Richemont has since shaken up its senior management  Recent appointments have included the group s first female watch brand chief executives  Chabi Nouri at Piaget and Catherine Rénier at Jaeger LeCoultre  Mr  Ferla  who came across in an interview as softly spoken and contemplative  was philosophical about the changes  I would not oppose old versus young   he said   But I would say that in the life cycle of a company  you need different strengths and weaknesses at different times  When it comes to the new generation of Richemont executive  he added   Each of us has different strengths and weaknesses  and different tempers  Some are good at organizing teams  building the business  Then you get others who are better at taking a business to the next step  the visionaries  So which is he   A bit of both   he said   As chief executive  you need to set the vision and say   This is where we want to go   And then you have to make sure that everybody is involved and contributes  Mr  Ferla was clear that his vision was not to rock the boat   Charlie  my predecessor  left a very good legacy   he said  referring to Juan Carlos Torres   Really  my objective is to keep Vacheron Constantin for the next generation  He said  however  that he had a big job to show watch buyers that his company was not just a traditional watchmaker  adding that Vacheron Constantin did not always get the credit it deserved  We are not necessarily seen as a very innovative maison  but we are   Mr  Ferla said   We have a very strong history and DNA  and yet we re very contemporary  Two years ago  we won a Grand Prix d Horlogerie de Genève award for the Celestia  which has 23 complications  And our 57260 pocket watch is the most complicated watch ever made  In January at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie  better known as S I H H   Vacheron Constantin introduced the Traditionnelle Twin Beat  what it called  the world s first user controlled dual frequency watch   It has two modes so the power reserve can be extended to 65 days  a breakthrough in Swiss watchmaking Mr  Ferla also said his company appealed to a much younger consumer than people thought  He said the average age of a Vacheron Constantin buyer was late 30s to early 40s and that the watches  average price was around  30 000  But he acknowledged that   Our clients are connoisseurs  It s really a quest to work for your Vacheron Constantin  Last year  Vacheron Constantin introduced the FiftySix and marketed it with music  the campaign was fronted by the musicians James Bay and Benjamin Clementine  and the company announced a partnership with Abbey Road Studios in London  Industry critics described the campaign as  millennial focused  and  hipster   As the collection included the Self Winding model  at  11 600  it became the brand s new entry level line ImageVacheron Constantin introduced the Traditionnelle Twin Beat in January at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie Were the collection and the campaign intended to give Vacheron Constantin a younger feel   It was not the objective   Mr  Ferla said   We miscommunicated this  It was not to target a younger audience or to be more affordable  We wanted to create a line that was different from what we had in the classic segment  The Patrimony and the Traditionnelle are very pure in their design   he added   and we wanted to have something a little bit retro contemporary  a complement to our classical offer  However  Mr  Ferla said the FiftySix had been  a great success  and  far beyond expectation   Richemont does not disclose financial performance by brand  and he would not offer details   What I can tell you is that we have very good traction on all our collections   he said The company s intention has not been to increase production  Mr  Ferla said  It makes about 20 000 watches a year  he said   much less than most of our competitors    That number  times average prices  would put income in the region of  600 million   Estimates put Patek Philippe at 50 000 to 80 000  During a news conference at the Salon de la Haute Horlogerie in January  François Henry Bennahmias  the Audemars Piguet chief executive  said his company made 40 000 watches last year  We have now the right level   Mr  Ferla said   There is no need for us to say   We want to produce 50 000 watches   We don t reason that way   Growth  he said  would come through improving quality and client service  and by increasing average prices Mr  Ferla said he had been pleased with the company s progress under his leadership   If two years ago I was handed a piece of paper and told   You can sign here  this is where you will be in two years   and that was where we are today  I would have signed up right away  He said that while personal highlights of his job had included developing award winning products and successful negotiations with landlords and retailers  success had been more granular  It s what we call the politics of the small steps   he said   We did a lot of small steps but  in the end  we have gone on a nice journey  too  
On a recent morning at City Center  the ballerina Sara Mearns found herself running in circles around an imaginary bed  trying to fly  She made faces  She rolled her eyes  Her arms were not at all winglike  You re supposed to be beautiful   Joshua Bergasse told her   You have to be beautiful  You can t just flail  Ms  Mearns said   I wanted to flail  Mr  Bergasse  the choreographer and director of the Encores  production  I Married an Angel   opening on Wednesday  is also Ms  Mearns s husband  He shook his head with affection  but stuck to his guns   No  Was this what George Balanchine and Vera Zorina were like  In 1938  Balanchine choreographed the dances for  I Married an Angel   a Rodgers and Hart musical comedy  for Zorina  his glamorous soon to be wife  But except for some silent film  there s no record of the choreography Now  Mr  Bergasse  46  is creating new moves for his Angel  Ms  Mearns  33  who is a principal dancer with New York City Ballet  the company that Balanchine formed  with Lincoln Kirstein  in 1948  In the show  an Angel comes down from heaven  marries a mortal   Count Willy Palaffi  Mark Evans    and loses her wings It s a part made for Ms  Mearns who  as it happens is not only beautiful  but also funny   smart and daffy in a Carole Lombard kind of way  with a rich  meaty speaking voice  When Mr  Bergasse choreographed the Broadway musical  On the Town   he created the  Lonely Town  pas de deux on her   She filled in at the last minute for one performance   But this is the couple s biggest project together so far  and Ms  Mearns s first speaking role  I think we were both a little nervous   Mr  Bergasse said   This is such a fast process    Encores  productions come together quickly    but so far  so good  We know each other  I can understand what she really needs when she seems frustrated or tense about something  and she knows what I need  At the rehearsal  there was more laughter than angst  and more sweat than tears  It helps that Ms  Mearns has a lot of dancing to do   and dancing is what she does best For  The Surrealist Ballet   one of the show s two big numbers  Mr  Bergasse took cues from the artist René Magritte  though the original creators were inspired by a Salvador Dalí   The Magritte figures are easier to create on the dancers than melting clocks   he said ImageGeorge Balanchine and Vera Zorina in an undated photo

Getty ImagesThroughout  the choreography  fast and fluent with jazzy undercurrents  sweeps along with Ms  Mearns   partnered by Christian Tworzyanski  a former City Ballet dancer and her childhood friend   in command  It s what she s used to What she s not so used to  Dialogue   I have 140 lines   she said  shaking her head   I know  I know  But the scenes go by really fast  The night before meeting with the other actors for the first time  Ms  Mearns had a nightmare about being trapped in a scene rehearsal   It wasn t like I was scared   she said   But I didn t know what I was doing  But once she started rehearsing in reality  it all fell into place   I realized that the way actors rehearse is the way I rehearse dance   she said   When you mess up  you do it again  Mr  Bergasse and Ms  Mearns spoke about the production at City Center recently  What follows are edited excerpts from that conversation Why did you want to take this on  Sara Mearns When I learned it was Balanchine choreographing it at the time for his wife  I was like  oh my God  that s so sweet  But also  in my head  I was like  this is going to be really scary  I didn t really think about the fact that I would be acting  A year ago  I thought  O K  Wait a minute  What is this   Mr  Bergasse laughs  He turned to me and said   You need to start getting into acting lessons  Joshua Bergasse I did it early only because I know how busy she is Mearns The woman I was working with has worked with a lot of dancers  and she knows how we approach acting  We are physical with it  Sitting down and just reading something doesn t really work for us  We started to figure out what is this angel  Is she innocent  Is she a woman  Is she escaping heaven Is your Angel innocent Mearns I don t think I m innocent  I have rules in heaven  I can t tell a lie Bergasse She s naïve about the ways of mortals  By coming down to earth  she has to learn to be a little more mortal while not giving up who she really is Mearns The Angel realizes these humans are terrible  lying people doing all of these terrible things Is there a challenge for you in the dancing  Mearns It s my stamina   I have to speak and dance  I can t be talking to someone and be huffing and puffing ImageNot flailing   I do a little soft shoe in the surrealist ballet  because I was a tapper   Ms  Mearns said CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York TimesBergasse They were worried about her volume and breath  Is it going to be even harder when she has the point shoes on and is bourrée ing  Actually  it became easier for her Mearns My acting coach was worried  And then I put my point shoes on and she said   Oh my God  your voice just got lower   Like it settled back in How did you reimagine the dances  Bergasse Seeing the production photos  from the original  was really eye opening  In  the song   How to Win Friends and Influence People   there s a 10 second clip of a tap dance  I didn t know how much they actually tapped and what the style was  but it really showed me they were really hoofing Mearns I do a little soft shoe in  The Surrealist Ballet   because I was a tapper  Christian and I were big tappers  We competed Could this show turn into anything bigger  Bergasse I don t think so  It s so of a time  The direction Broadway is going is kind of the opposite of doing these pieces It could be political in an interesting way  the decay of civility and how it s O K  to lie  Mearns In that way  it s very relevant  It is about telling the truth and about how people don t tell the truth now or how you have to learn how to mask things Bergasse We had two women adapt the script  and they basically went through it with a  MeToo pen  It s more palatable for an audience in 2019  but it still gets across the same humor  the same relationships  This story is really the battle of the sexes You don t want to get rid of that because that still exists and that s fun  but you want to get rid of the grossness   Laughs  The horrible sexism How does Josh s choreography feel  Mearns It s fun  Like that whole harp solo  I do   what is it called Bergasse The Lindy Hop Mearns There it is  The Lindy Hop Bergasse The Angel starts playing the harp at this party to entertain and everybody falls asleep  so she decides to change the rhythm of the harp solo and she swings it  She gives it a swing rhythm  I thought  wouldn t it be kind of fun if it was based in swing dance  So we took stuff from Lindy Hop Mearns And I wouldn t normally do that ever  Anywhere 
Federal authorities investigating Russian interference in the presidential election obtained search warrants for emails of Michael D  Cohen  President Trump s former lawyer and fixer  beginning in July 2017  according to documents released Tuesday that provided a glimpse into the earliest stages of the inquiry into the president The documents show that by the time F B I  agents conducted a highly public raid on Mr  Cohen s home and office in April of last year  his business dealings had already been the subject of an extensive investigation  The records  including search warrants and other materials related to the April raid  were among nearly 900 pages of documents that a federal judge unsealed in response to a request by The New York Times and other news organizations The records were heavily redacted  More than 150 pages were fully blacked out  and many had names or portions of the material obscured  mostly because they were related to the continuing investigation of the Trump Organization Lanny J  Davis  a lawyer for Mr  Cohen  said in a statement on Monday night that the disclosures would only further Mr  Cohen s  interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress  One newly released search warrant said the F B I  and Manhattan federal prosecutors were investigating Mr  Cohen for a range of crimes  including defrauding several banks dating back to 2016 and a scheme  to make an illegal campaign contribution in October 2016 to then presidential candidate Donald Trump   The warrant also indicated they were investigating him for wire fraud and conspiracy Another search warrant showed that prosecutors for the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  were investigating Mr  Cohen for other crimes growing out of the Russia inquiry  including failure to register as a foreign agent and money laundering The documents give a rough timeline of how the Cohen investigation unfolded  Starting in July 2017  two months after Mr  Mueller s appointment  and stretching through November  his office obtained three search warrants for Mr  Cohen s emails and another for his iCloud account from a federal judge in Washington The timing of the warrants  which can take weeks if not longer to obtain  indicates that the investigation started even earlier By February 2018  Mr  Mueller s office had referred aspects of that investigation to federal prosecutors in Manhattan  F B I  agents raided Mr  Cohen s office and home in New York two months later Later in the year  Mr  Cohen pleaded guilty in two separate cases  In the first  he admitted to committing campaign finance violations by arranging hush money payments to two women who said they had affairs with Mr  Trump  as well as financial crimes  in a case brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan  In the second  he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in a case brought by Mr  Mueller s office Mr  Cohen  52  apologized at his sentencing in December  blaming himself for  my own weakness and a blind loyalty  to Mr  Trump that he said had led him  to choose a path of darkness over light  Judge William H  Pauley III sentenced Mr  Cohen to three years in prison  he is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on May 6 after Judge Pauley granted him a two month delay because of pending shoulder surgery and his need to prepare for testimony before three congressional committees Mr  Cohen testified on Feb  27 in a daylong public hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee about what he described as Mr  Trump s lies about his business interests in Russia and his role in the payment of hush money to one of the women  Stormy Daniels  an adult film actress  In his testimony  Mr  Cohen called the president a racist  a con man and a cheat The newly public documents also show how little the public knew about the Russian investigation in real time as prosecutors zeroed in on Mr  Cohen Prosecutors  for instance  unearthed bank payments from a New York investment firm tied to Viktor Vekselberg  a billionaire Russian businessman with ties to the Kremlin who met with Mr  Cohen in his Trump Tower office just days before the inauguration  the documents show The public did not learn of those payments  or that Mr  Mueller s prosecutors later interviewed Mr  Vekselberg  until almost a year later The search materials were made public at the order of Judge Pauley  Last fall  when The New York Times and other news organizations asked the judge to unseal the materials  the government opposed such action Prosecutors cited the  need to protect an ongoing law enforcement investigation  and the privacy of  numerous uncharged third parties  Judge Pauley ultimately ordered the government to provide him with a copy of the sealed materials and its proposed redactions  On Monday  after saying he had reviewed and approved the redactions  he ordered the government to file the redacted copy on the public court docket The judge also said he would revisit the documents  secrecy in the near future  directing prosecutors to provide him with a confidential update by May 15 
Barbara Hammer  an experimental filmmaker who began celebrating lesbian sexuality and history in her work in the 1970s  and who in her last years turned her battle against cancer into cinematic art

incredible   she said in 1990 in an interview for Art Papers magazine   The film was larger than any canvas I d painted  and the audience was captured by the darkness and direction of light to watch

companies The fine  worth about  1 7 billion  is the third against Google by the European Union since 2017  reinforcing the region s position as the world s most aggressive watchdog of an industry with an increasingly powerful role in society and the global economy  The regulators said Google had violated antitrust rules by imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe Europe s regulatory approach was once criticized as unfairly focusing on technology companies from the United States  but is now viewed as a potential global model as governments question the influence of Silicon Valley  Europe is at the forefront of a broad debate about the role of tech platforms like Apple  Amazon  Facebook and Google  and whether their size and power hurt competition With the announcement on Wednesday  the European fines against Google total roughly 8 2 billion euros  or  9 3 billion  But the bloc has not received any of the money yet  Google is appealing the earlier decisions  and is mulling whether to appeal the most recent ruling  Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anticompetitive contractual restrictions on third party websites   Margrethe Vestager  Europe s top antitrust watchdog  said in a statement   This is illegal under E U  antitrust rules  The fine centers on contracts that license the use of Google s search bar on websites run by newspapers  blogs  travel services and other companies  European regulators said the operators of the third party websites using Google s search bar had been required to display a disproportionate number of text ads from Google s own advertising services over competing digital advertising companies The practice  regulators said  undercut competitors  such as Microsoft and Yahoo  that were trying to challenge Google in search  There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in its contracts  except to keep its rivals out of the market   Ms  Vestager said at a news conference in Brussels  She said the ruling covered 2006 to 2016  when Google stopped the practices Europe s actions against Silicon Valley are influencing policy debates around the world  but some critics question the overall effectiveness of the penalties The European Union spent a decade investigating Google  a slow and deliberate process  during which the company s business and power continued to grow  Annual revenue at Google s parent company  Alphabet  reached  137 billion last year  compared with  22 billion a decade earlier  On Wednesday  Google shares rose 2 percent The Google cases highlight a larger question policymakers face in overseeing the digital economy  As it becomes increasingly clear that antitrust fines or after the fact remedies are not enough to bring vibrant competition to the market  governments will need to move to deeper tech sector regulation to remedy problems   said Gene Kimmelman  a former antitrust official in the Justice Department who is now president of Public Knowledge  a consumer advocacy group  He suggested rules preventing tech platforms like Google from favoring their own services In the United States  where there has been limited regulation of tech companies  Senator Elizabeth Warren  Democrat of Massachusetts  has made breaking up Google and other tech giants a priority in her presidential campaign  This week  Representative David Cicilline  Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Antitrust  Commercial and Administrative Law  called for a federal antitrust investigation of Facebook In response to the ruling on Wednesday  Google said   Healthy  thriving markets are in everyone s interest  ImageMargrethe Vestager  the European Union s top antitrust watchdog  discussing the penalty at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday CreditJohn Thys Agence France Presse   Getty Images We ve already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission s concerns   Kent Walker  Google s senior vice president for global affairs  said in a statement   Over the next few months  we ll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe  The case is the last of three investigations the European Commission has pursued against Google  which has headquarters in Mountain View  Calif Last year  Ms  Vestager fined Google a record  4 34 billion for using its ownership of the Android mobile operating system to unfairly undercut rivals in the mobile phone market  a decision that also forced the company to change how it bundled its apps on smartphones  In 2017  the company was fined 2 4 billion euros for unfairly favoring its own shopping services over those of rivals The two previous rulings have not had a big impact on Google s financial health  but they have forced the tech giant to adjust some business practices After the Android ruling last year  Google for the first time began charging handset makers to pre install Gmail  Google Maps and other popular applications for Android devices in the European Union Perhaps in an attempt to head off additional inquiries  Google announced a number of further changes to services across Europe on Wednesday  after rivals complained that it continued to benefit from anticompetitive business practices For the first time  the company said  it will ask Android phone users in Europe if they want to switch to a web browser and search engine not owned by Google  To allow more competition when customers shop with Google  it will give other shopping sites more prominence in its search results  the company also said  Google said it would do the same with local search queries in Europe  such as when a person searches for a restaurant  a move that could help companies like TripAdvisor and OpenTable Outside of its review of practices by Google and others  the European Union has adopted tough new privacy rules that many countries outside Europe now view as a template  Regulators here have also investigated tech companies  tax practices and called for more scrutiny of artificial intelligence The decision on Wednesday against Google will be one of the final major antitrust rulings in the five year term of Ms  Vestager  whose crackdown on Silicon Valley while competition commissioner has made her a minor celebrity in the often staid world of European politics Ms  Vestager has expressed openness to serving another term as the bloc s top antitrust watchdog  but she is also considered a contender to become president of the European Commission  the most powerful executive position in the European Union  Her future will depend in part on the outcome of European parliamentary elections in May Even with her possible departure  pressure on the technology industry is not easing The European Union is expected to adopt new copyright regulations as early as next week that would impose restrictions to stop unlicensed content  like music and videos  from being shared on tech platforms like Google and Facebook  Another proposal tries to block the sharing of hate speech and extremist content  a policy that some critics say could lead to censorship At the same time  regulators across Europe are pursuing several lines of inquiry Ms  Vestager s office announced last year that Amazon was under investigation for its treatment of independent sellers who use its website to reach customers Apple  which in 2016 was ordered to pay Ireland  14 5 billion in back taxes  is now under scrutiny for its App Store policies  Facebook is facing separate inquiries related to its business practices and handling of user data  Google s advertising practices are also being monitored by privacy advocates who are urging regulators to begin a new investigation for violating privacy rights  Businesses and consumers  they depend on platforms to get the best out of digitization   Ms  Vestager said   Illegal behavior in these cases is a very serious affair  
To determine the health of the economy  you could scrutinize the minutes of Federal Reserve meetings  pore over the latest economic data and scour trade publications  Or you could simply look up The towering cranes that rise above development sites can be a useful financial indicator  like consumer confidence polls or housing starts  according to Rider Levett Bucknall  a construction consulting firm that uses the equipment as the basis for its RLB Crane Index The index  a tally of cranes in 13 major North American cities  provides a snapshot of economic sentiment  said Julian Anderson  a president of the firm s North American region  It was created in 2015 as a tool for clients  who use it to assess hiring trends and activity in urban markets  he said  Nationally  the construction industry employed 7 46 million people in 2018  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  continuing several years of increases  But it s still recovering from the last recession  In 2006  the number of workers was 3 percent higher  7 69 million If hiring continues to climb  shrinking the labor pool  high project costs could get even steeper  Mr  Anderson said  That might finally force builders to pump the brakes  But  any change in the market wouldn t probably show up until the end of the year   he said  The index is not the only unusual economic indicator  Other strange measures include the Buttered Popcorn Index  the Super Bowl Indicator and divorce rates  Jagdish N  Bhagwati  a professor of economics at Columbia  said the number of gauges like these had multiplied since the 1980s  when The Economist magazine created the Big Mac Index  an informal comparison of the cost of hamburgers in different countries used to analyze exchange rates But the trends that shape the global currency system  Dr  Bhagwati said  are too complex to be reduced to single McDonald s meal  Then again  boiling economics down to a pocketbook issue like popcorn may help consumers understand the underlying economic theory   Sometimes being funny helps people focus on the things you want them to focus on   he said The crane index does have its limitations  Because it tracks cities where Rider Levett Bucknall has offices  it misses growing markets like Houston and Atlanta  Still  it provides useful data about which projects have broken ground  well before marketing kicks in The index includes only tower cranes  which rise 10 to 80 stories and have long booms that lift steel and concrete for projects including hotels  condominiums  offices  stadiums  convention centers  arts complexes and schools  This winter  the tally came to 423  The total has stayed relatively steady since the summer of 2015  there were 439 cranes then   which was the crest of the current development wave  some brokers say  The index has remained consistent despite headwinds like climbing interest rates  trade turmoil  rising material costs and a tight labor market Seattle was the top city in the United States on the latest index  with 59 cranes  Only Toronto  one of two Canadian cities on the list  Calgary is the other   had more  with 104  In last place was Phoenix  with five Amazon is partly to thank for Seattle s top ranking  which it has held for several years  After a flurry of development  the internet giant has transformed the South Lake Union neighborhood  a sleepy former warehouse district  into a dense office hub But other areas  like downtown  are awash in hammers and hard hats  too   I m looking out my window  and I m seeing cranes everywhere   said David Gurry  a senior vice president with the brokerage firm Colliers International there Typical real estate cycles run about eight years  Mr  Gurry said  but the current one  clocking in at 12 so far  still has legs   Normally  I might be concerned to see so many cranes  because it might be a sign of overbuilding   he said Housing is a huge driver of real estate construction  High rise apartment buildings  which gained popularity a couple of decades ago  are increasingly common  But office buildings are also arriving in a resilient market  Seattle has 60 million square feet of office space  brokers say  a quarter of which is controlled by Amazon But even when Amazon is not involved  developers feel confident about their chances  Asking rents in prime office buildings in Seattle  where the vacancy rate is 7 percent  average  50 per square foot  brokers say ImageThe crane index provides a snapshot of economic sentiment in major cities  but may not fully capture the national mood  CreditChona Kasinger for The New York TimesCounting cranes in Seattle and elsewhere can seem unscientific  Over a few days twice a year  employees of Rider Levett Bucknall will set off by foot or in cars  eyes turned toward the horizon  If possible  they later check their results against building permits In Portland  Ore   searches are helped by a tram across the city that climbs 500 feet in the air  said Kim Craigie  a counter for the firm who also works in marketing   Once you start  you can t not notice them   she said With 26 cranes this winter  Portland was tied with Chicago  even though Chicago has 2 7 million people and Portland only 630 000 An upgrade of the Oregon Convention Center  a twin spired complex near the Willamette River  is one of the larger projects  Framing the sky are three cranes  two of them for a 14 story  600 room hotel that will open next winter and be operated by Hyatt  The third crane swivels over a new parking garage Because the crane index in many ways also reflects the state of the economy several years earlier  when projects were conceived  it can obscure current realities  brokers and developers say  Washington  for instance  seems to be on a hot streak  with 28 cranes this winter  up from 25 last summer and just a few shy of its 31 crane high in summer 2015 Yet office rents declined in the fourth quarter last year  according to the real estate services firm Cushman   Wakefield  as a surge of office buildings came online  And political gridlock  exemplified by the partial government shutdown in December and January  could sap job creation and  by extension  demand  said Nathan J  Edwards  a senior director of research for Cushman   Wakefield  After the recession  D C  was the darling of the investment community   he said   But there has been softening  A handful of new office buildings are testing that premise  like 1901 L Street  a project from the Meridian Group included in the most recent crane count   A hotel rising next door  at a former steakhouse  has a tower crane as well  As part of a  100 million gut renovation  Meridian is replacing the cast concrete facade of a 1970s office building with a glass one  while adding four floors  including a terrace lined penthouse where tenants can host parties  Winston and Strawn  a law firm  has leased about half of No  1901  which will open next year  said Wil Machen  a Meridian senior vice president  Other cities where cranes are plentiful  despite signs of a global slowdown  are Los Angeles  44   New York  28  and San Francisco  29   according to the index  whose clients include construction  engineering and architecture firms  If the analyses seem overly optimistic  that may have more to do with the health of those cities than the condition of the country  according to economists  who add that cranes are not likely to disappear anytime soon  This is a golden age of construction in American metropolitan areas   said Gian Luca Clementi  as associate professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University   The U S  is still less urbanized than similar countries  so if anything  we will probably see more and more construction  
President Trump on Tuesday named Stephen Dickson  a former Delta Air Lines executive  as his choice to become the permanent head of the Federal Aviation Administration  an agency facing scrutiny after two deadly airplane crashes in less than five months Mr  Dickson will be nominated for the post amid intensifying calls worldwide for the aviation agency to explain its approval of the Boeing 737 Max  the jet involved in the two accidents  an Ethiopian Airlines crash this month and a Lion Air crash in October Mr  Dickson retired as Delta s senior vice president of flight operations last fall after a 27 year career at the company during which he flew commercial routes and also oversaw safety  pilot training and regulatory compliance  He is a former Air Force officer  Air Force Academy graduate and F 15 fighter pilot  according to Delta  Steve is passionate about safety and has a deep understanding of the needs of the aviation industry and the traveling public   said Michael Huerta  a former F A A  administrator picked by President Barack Obama The F A A  has been run by an acting administrator  Daniel Elwell  since January 2018  when Mr  Huerta s term ended  Mr  Elwell  a longtime commercial pilot  was previously the agency s deputy administrator  a role Mr  Trump chose him for in June 2017 ImageStephen Dickson retired from Delta this fall after 27 years at the company CreditDelta Air LinesIn the past  Mr  Trump toyed with the idea of naming his personal pilot  John Dunkin  as the aviation agency s permanent administrator Mr  Dickson was  extremely well regarded  at Delta  where he was seen as  a man of great integrity   said Henry Harteveldt  the founder of the travel analysis firm Atmosphere Research Group  That will be very  very important as a character trait for the new head of the F A A    Mr  Harteveldt said In 2016  Mr  Dickson wrote in an op ed article for USA Today that a proposal to privatize the national air traffic control system and remove it from F A A  oversight   a suggestion supported by Mr  Trump   was  a bad idea for many reasons  If confirmed by the Senate to a five year term as the F A A  s leader  Mr  Dickson will be responsible for guiding the agency s response to criticism of its safety certification process and its response to the Boeing crashes  The agency hesitated to ground the 737 Max even after safety regulators around the world made the move On Tuesday  Elaine Chao  the transportation secretary  asked the inspector general of her department to conduct an audit of the F A A  s certification of the 737 Max 8  which the agency approved in 2017 The F A A  also faces questions over why it approved limited training procedures for the Boeing jet  which left pilots unfamiliar with new software in the plane  The Lion Air crash in October raised concerns about that new software  an automated flight control system that can push down the plane s nose in certain situations 
After years of criticism  Facebook announced on Tuesday that it would stop allowing advertisers in key categories to show their messages only to people of a certain race  gender or age group The company said that anyone advertising housing  jobs or credit   three areas where federal law prohibits discrimination in ads   would no longer have the option of explicitly aiming ads at people on the basis of those characteristics The changes are part of a settlement with groups that have sued Facebook over these practices in recent years  including the American Civil Liberties Union  the National Fair Housing Alliance and the Communications Workers of America  They also cover advertising on Instagram and Messenger  which Facebook owns  We think this settlement is historic and will go a long way toward making sure that these types of discriminatory practices can t happen   Sheryl Sandberg  the company s chief operating officer  said in an interview The company said it planned to carry out the changes by the end of the year and would pay less than  5 million to settle five lawsuits brought by the groups A related complaint by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development is pending  A Facebook spokesman said the company was in discussions with the department to resolve the case  A HUD official did not respond to a request for comment The change comes with Facebook under pressure on many fronts  On Tuesday  it was on the defensive with the Trump administration after it blocked posts by the White House social media director  Dan Scavino Jr  Facebook later apologized  saying the posts had been mistaken for spam   but not before President Trump warned on Twitter that  I will be looking into this  and declared that Facebook  Google and Twitter  are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats  And over the last year  Facebook has dealt with scandal after scandal related to the company s data sharing practices and privacy  In early 2018  The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica  a political research firm  had inappropriately harvested information from millions of Facebook profiles  largely because of Facebook s improper stewardship of user data  Facebook has been criticized for a data breach late last year  compromising the accounts of millions of users Several news organizations  including The Times and ProPublica  have also reported on the use of Facebook s targeting tools in ways that prevent members of certain groups  like women or workers over 40  from seeing ads Pauline Kim  a professor of employment law at Washington University in St  Louis  praised the changes but cautioned against overstating their significance  Taking the explicit ability to discriminate off the table is an important first step   Professor Kim said   But I don t think it solves the problem of the potential for biased serving of ads  Ms  Kim said  for example  that an employer could place an ad that it intended to show to both men and women  but over time  Facebook s algorithms could begin to show the ad primarily to men if it determined that men were much likelier to click on the ad  It s within the realm of possibility depending on how the algorithm is constructed   Professor Kim said   You could end up serving ads  inadvertently  to biased audiences  Ms  Sandberg acknowledged the limits of the policy changes and said Facebook had committed to working with the other parties to find additional ways to root out discrimination  The parties will discuss progress on that front every six months for three years after the changes are rolled out  In addition to being a historic settlement of five separate lawsuits that will change practices on Facebook and other platforms  it s also notable that we agreed to continue to study the algorithmic effect of ads with Facebook   said Anthony Romero  executive director of the A C L U Ms  Sandberg did not directly respond when asked whether Facebook would make its targeting algorithms more transparent to aid this effort For years  Facebook has made the pitch to customers that its wealth of user data   from birthdays to favorite television shows   allows it to deliver the right ad to the right person at the right time  These capabilities helped Facebook  along with its rival Google  to take in most of the more than  100 billion in annual online ad spending But Facebook s access to the data that powers this revenue model may be starting to dry up  Last year  a new rule in the European Union  the General Data Protection Regulation  forced internet companies to comply with stricter safeguards in handling user information  And as customers become more hesitant to share their own data  Facebook and other digital media companies are moving to regain their trust through additional protections Now  some of Facebook s efforts to appease critics who complain of discriminatory practices may further chip away at the model In the interview  Ms  Sandberg conceded that the changes could make advertising on Facebook less efficient for some customers who had used the targeting practices  in a very fair and nondiscriminatory way   but added   We believe that that was a cost well worth bearing  Under the new approach  Facebook will require advertisers in the areas of housing  employment and credit to use a separate portal that will not include gender or age as targeting options  It will also preclude selecting an affinity group of people interested in a race  ethnicity or religion  The company has generally allowed advertisers seeking to reach members of a race or religion to aim at such affinity groups The company will continue to allow advertisers in other areas to deliver ads on the basis of age  gender or any affinity groups Even in the less sensitive areas  advertisers can t exclude groups associated with race  religion or ethnicity from seeing ads  They can only affirmatively aim ads at them Advertisers that deliberately and repeatedly avoid the new portal when placing ads in the three regulated areas will probably face consequences  though the company said it had yet to determine those Facebook and many businesses that have used its platform to designate ad targets by gender  age or race have long maintained that the practice can be legitimate For example  an advertiser might want to show men and women different versions of the same message to test marketing strategies  Some advertisers also say they use Facebook to aim at certain groups   like young people   but place similar ads using other media  like the radio or print magazines  to appeal to older people But many legal experts have said that advertisers who engage in this targeting nonetheless faced a serious risk of liability under discrimination laws  Litigation and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charges against employers that have used Facebook in this way are proceeding and will be unaffected by the settlement The question of Facebook s own liability  on the other hand  has been murkier  While it is illegal under federal law to publish a discriminatory housing ad  the law typically holds only employers and employment agencies  and not passive ad publishers  culpable for discriminatory job ads  Many state laws are more aggressive On top of this  Facebook has long argued that it enjoys broad immunity under the federal law that shields internet companies from liability over content produced by third parties One possible exception to these defenses would arise if Facebook were more directly involved in developing the ads   for example  if its algorithms  and not parameters that advertisers choose overtly  were responsible for shaping an ad s audience  The changes announced Tuesday  which do not appear to preclude such targeting  may not save Facebook from liability in these contexts Beyond eliminating the option of aiming housing  employment and credit ads at audiences according to certain demographic characteristics  Facebook will prevent advertisers from marketing to users according to their ZIP code  a practice that could enable redlining Facebook is also removing thousands of so called interest segments  including some that advertisers could use to reach people by characteristics like gender or age  for ads in the three regulated areas  For example  to show how advertisers could keep certain groups from seeing housing ads on Facebook  the National Fair Housing Alliance once created a fictitious ad that excluded groups like  corporate moms  and  stay at home  mothers Those segments would no longer be available for targeting by housing  employment and credit ads once Facebook carries out the proposed changes 
Sadly  The Times has covered a lot of shootings  But the killing of 50 people at mosques in Christchurch  New Zealand  on Friday by a gunman intent on using the tools of the internet as weapons in his fight raised a number of new issues for our newsroom In the aftermath of the attack  we sat down with some of our top editors who make the difficult calls about how to cover the news without inadvertently glorifying a killer or becoming a pawn in his game Here s a look at some of the issues our journalists have been sorting through  Please leave additional questions or feedback for them in the comments What made this story unusual The shooter strapped a camera to his forehead to stream a live video on Facebook as he gunned down dozens of people who had gathered to pray  He teased his act on Twitter  announced it on the online message board 8chan and appeared to have posted a 74 page manifesto online Kevin Roose  a Times columnist who writes about the intersection of technology  business and culture  told Michael Barbaro on The Daily on Monday morning   It set this shooting up as almost an internet performance  Like it was native to the internet  and it was born out of and aimed into this culture of extremely concentrated internet radicalism  In many ways  the attack unfolded online just as the gunman seemed to have planned  The video was widely available on sites like Facebook  Twitter and YouTube  until the platforms managed mostly to block it  On message boards  commenters discussed saving the video so it could later be uploaded on other sites if necessary  There is no doubt in my mind that this guy was very aware of how his video and his manifesto would filter through the internet and get refracted and picked up and analyzed   Kevin said   This was  in a way  engineered for internet virality  The manipulation of technology and use of online social platforms to document the killings  publicize them and try to inspire others to imitate them posed significant ethical challenges for our journalists running the coverage Michael Slackman  our international editor  called this an extreme corruption of a form of communication that was once promoted and viewed as a means of uniting people and advancing democratic values  Instead  you have someone who designed a horrific terrorist attack using all of the power of social media and the internet to spread his vile views   he said   So for us  it was how do you cover it in that context  how do we understand it and explain it  and how do we avoid becoming the tools of a terrorist  How did the unusual nature of the attack change The Times s calculations around how to cover it Our editors often have to decide if we should publish disturbing images or videos from shootings  bombings and war  They must weigh an image s news value and our mission to inform the public about the horrors of an attack against how intrusive the image is and how upsetting it could be for our readers or those affected by the tragedy to see it  We have to have a real reason for showing these things   said Mark Scheffler  our deputy editor of video  The video or images must be used  to tell a broader story  not just to say   Here s video of this guy s shooting spree    Read about a recent debate among our readers and in our newsroom over whether we should have published graphic photographs after a deadly attack in Nairobi  This case was different because the person who shot the video was not an eyewitness  journalist or member of law enforcement  It was the attacker himself  Here  the fact that the video was made by the killer added a whole other dimension to it   said Phil Corbett  our associate managing editor for standards   You have this additional factor of  Are you going to help publicize this terrorist video that the killer has made himself  obviously with the intent of it being seen as widely as possible  That made all of us even more cautious and wary about whether we would use any images  Ultimately our editors decided not to run any of the gunman s video of the attack or even link to it Why do a terrorist s motivations matter Even if an assailant has clear goals of wanting video of his attack publicized   and knows how to use the internet to make his massacre go viral   the material itself might have news value  While we don t want to be part of a gunman s propaganda effort  our primary goal remains providing newsworthy information to our readers However  as Phil explained  our journalists must still take into consideration the source of the video and the motivations of the gunman who produced it so that we do not inadvertently become part of the story  Terrorists want publicity and recognition   he said   If we decide to publish it  even if for legitimate journalistic reasons  we have to recognize that to some degree our actions are part of the whole event  and that is an uncomfortable position for us to be in  He added that news organizations like The Times are particularly sensitive to this because we have been closely following how platforms like Facebook have been misused to spread hateful campaigns and disrupt elections  We don t want to essentially be in the same situation   he said What about that manifesto Another unusual aspect of this attack was that the manifesto attributed to the accused killer and published on message boards was not simply a disturbing dissertation on his political ideology and motivations  such as ones released by other mass killers  In this situation  the gunman appears to have intentionally filled it with language to troll and confuse the news media  It was full of deception and misdirection   Michael said   It was written in a way to trick and make fun of the public and the press  The Times initially decided to handle the manifesto by assigning two reporters to annotate sections of it  After closely reading the material  however  the reporters realized they couldn t annotate it without playing into the hands of the attacker  Instead  our international correspondent Patrick Kingsley wrote an article that sought to answer the questions we had hoped the manifesto would address  What was the gunman thinking  and why did he open fire at two mosques In the end  we neither linked to nor annotated the manifesto New Zealand Is Loath to Use Suspect s Name to Avoid Amplifying His CauseMarch 19  2019A Mass Murder of  and for  the InternetMarch 15  2019Why do you keep using the suspect s name After school shootings in the United States and other mass attacks  we increasingly hear from readers who ask that we not publish the name or photo of the suspect because they worry that doing so glorifies assailants and inspires additional attacks After we published news on Tuesday that the prime minister of New Zealand  Jacinda Ardern  would not use the suspect s name in order not to give him notoriety  readers questioned why in that very article The Times ran the man s name  The media holds responsibility to tell the truth but also not sensationalize and in this case  as muted as it might seem  you are complicit   a commenter wrote on our site The Times profiles attackers  and names them  after such incidents in order to give our readers a better understanding of what happened and why  Our feeling has always been that who these people are is part of the news   Matt Purdy  a deputy managing editor  said on Friday  as The Times sought to confirm the gunman s identity   It s not more important than the lives that are lost  by any means  but who these people are could explain to people what their interests and experiences are  In a very depressing way  it is important  It s news  As school shootings and other such attacks have become more common  we have also tried to balance our need to provide information with the legitimate concerns of not inspiring new attacks or giving notoriety to a killer who is seeking just that In the case of the New Zealand attack  The Times decided to publish the suspect s name but made sure to use it responsibly  We have not put it in headlines and do not cite it gratuitously And the photo We have handled a photograph of the gunman in the same way  We ran it as a small image inside the newspaper  we did not put it on our home page or front page  We are trying to hit that right balance of informing readers  helping readers understand who this person was  and yet not providing the notoriety that might then inspire the next person   Phil said O K   now what The attack in New Zealand is unlikely to be the last in which a gunman uses the internet to try to control the narrative  Kevin  our technology columnist  says that journalists need to be aware of these tactics and handle material posted online with extreme caution  I think we need to understand   and we re starting to  I think   that media manipulation is often a key part of how violent extremists plan their activities   he explained  They see us as easy marks  and they know that most journalists don t know what 8chan is  let alone understand the ideological terrain there   he said   So we need to be exceedingly careful with these things  and not just repeat their claims at face value  A note to readers who are not subscribers  This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly

BAGHDADI  Iraq   As he hunted for a seasonal delicacy  Mohaned Salah Yasseen scanned the ground intently  searching for places where the soil is cracked and slightly raised   the telltale sign a desert truffle lies below So he failed to notice the two pickup trucks  driven by men in military uniforms  until they were almost upon him  They ordered me to get into the truck   said Mr  Yasseen  a 31 year old pharmacist   I thought about saying no  but they were armed  As he climbed in  he became the latest victim in a new campaign by the Islamic State Driven out of most of the territory it controlled in Iraq and Syria  the group has gone underground  its remaining fighters in Iraq carrying out sporadic attacks Since late January  they have been kidnapping and  in some cases  executing Iraqi truffle hunters  mostly in the deserts of western Anbar Province  The Iraqi security forces confirmed the kidnapping of 44 truffle hunters this year  and more have probably gone unreported The abductions are only a fraction of the Islamic State attacks now taking place in Iraq  where every day brings one or more reports of a checkpoint shooting  skirmish or kidnapping  But the attacks on truffle hunters reflect a renewed emphasis on inciting sectarian tensions While Sunni Muslim truffle hunters typically pay a ransom to win release  as Mr  Yasseen did  Shiite Muslim truffle hunters never get that chance  They are killed The Islamic State considers Shiites infidels  and since its inception the group has killed them and destroyed their mosques         g 1319 for web BAGHDADImap

military authorities view the group s treatment of hostages as an attempt to incite the kind of sectarian strife that tore Iraq apart from 2003 to 2008  after the fall of Saddam Hussein  and was reprised from 2012 to 2014 Abu Ali al Basri  the director general of Iraqi intelligence  said his fear was that the killings could goad Shiite politicians into verbally tarring Sunnis collectively  That message would then be amplified by the media and could set off a cycle of violence The kidnappings are a way for the Islamic State  also known as ISIS  to raise money and signal to the civilian population it remains a potent force  Some 5 000 to 6 000 Islamic State fighters remain in Iraq and Syria  according to Iraqi officials  who consider the group a manageable threat Despite the danger  desert truffle hunters seem undeterred  The delicacy is prized and can bring up to  6 a pound in local markets The desert truffle is far less fragrant and flavorful than its European counterpart  but is valued in Iraq for its meaty texture and subtle taste  Known in Iraqi Arabic as  chimay   almost every family in this region of Iraq has a favorite recipe In local lore  chimay is a gift from God  One story goes that Mary  the mother of Jesus  asked for meat without bones  and God gave her chimay Mr  Yasseen had driven several hours into the desert from his home in Bhagdadi to a place so idyllic and remote it was hard to imagine it could be dangerous  Truffle hunting is a favorite activity of many families in western Iraq during the cool winter days when the arid landscape is briefly verdant  It was a flat area  beautiful  very green  nothing but earth and sky   Mr  Yasseen said After his captors blindfolded him and five cousins who had been hunting truffles with him  they seemed surprisingly eager to make sure their hostages knew who had seized them ImageMohaned Salah Yasseen  a pharmacist in Baghdadi  a town in Anbar Province  was kidnapped by the Islamic State while collecting desert truffles CreditBayan Nariman The New York Times They asked us   Do you know who we are    Mr  Yasseen said   Then they said   Just to let you know  we are the Islamic State   Mr  Yasseen recalled immediately thinking   I m dead  This is it  they will kill me  Instead  he and his cousins were driven to the mouth of a tunnel that led into a small underground room where there was already another group of captives The Islamic State fighters did not speak  but brought food and invited them to pray The next day  an Islamic State operative came to question the first group of captives  but he seemed to already know facts about them and ticked off personal details  like where one man worked and what his political sympathies were Mr  Yasseen suspected that the Islamic State had agents embedded in the local government who could look up such details In one case  the Islamic State inquisitor accused a man of lying about his occupation  according to a captured elementary school principal  We found out you work with the civil defense  and so your sentence is death   the inquisitor said   So far  the only Sunni truffle hunters killed have been off duty police officers   It s true  I used to work for civil defense   the accused man said   but then I quit and now I am a butcher  The school principal  Salah Malik Flayah  62  said he rose to the man s defense   He is telling the truth  I know him  He is my neighbor and he is a butcher  ImageHamza Kadhim al Juborii holding a rifle that he said he stole from his Islamic State abductors CreditHaidar Hamdani Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe butcher s life was spared Mr  Flayah was told he d have to pay  50 000 for his freedom  an inconceivable amount on his  1 200 a month salary  Eventually  the price dropped to  20 000  Some were asked to pay  10 000  For Mr  Yasseen s group  the ransoms were similar Hamza Kadhim al Jubori  42  a Shiite farmer  had a very different story  The remote area where he and two of his brothers  his nephew and two neighbors went to gather truffles was about 65 miles south of where Mr  Yasseen was kidnapped Like Mr  Yasseen  they were captured by men wearing military uniforms and were taken through an underground tunnel into a room where there were other captives  The similarities ended there The extremists brought Mr  Jubori s group only a single date and a half cup of water each while the Sunni captives were given a full meal  The Sunnis were invited to pray  but not Mr  Jubori and his relatives  The Sunnis  handcuffs were removed  but not those of Mr  Jubori s group  whose shoes were also taken An Islamic State operative called each of the Sunni captives  names  noting their hometowns  but when he turned to the Shiites  he just said   apostate   a death sentence During the night  the fighters drove Mr  Jubori and his companions into the desert  An M 16 rifle was between the Islamic State driver and the guard in the passenger seat Fearing he would be killed at any moment  Mr  Jubori said he pulled at the ropes that bound his hands until he freed them  whispering to his brother to do the same  I just was hoping to survive  to live  I watch a lot of American films  Jackie Chan  Arnold   he said  referring to Arnold Schwarzenegger   And I thought maybe I could save myself  ImageDesert truffles being sold at a market in Rawa  Iraq  a town

dove into the driver s seat  turned the key in the ignition but the engine would not start He grabbed the M 16  poked it into the other fighter s stomach and pulled the trigger  Nothing happened  He tried again  Nothing  He later realized he had failed to take off the safety lock  I lost hope   he said   The car doesn t work  the rifle doesn t work  I can t see anything because we re driving without lights  Terrified  he jumped out of the truck   I wasn t thinking about anyone else  I couldn t think of anything   he said   I was just holding the rifle and running  Then other Islamic State fighters in a second vehicle began shooting toward him in the dark  Mr  Jubori flung himself under some desert scrub and lay still until they drove away He said he walked for a week before he was rescued by Bedouins  desert nomads  who were out collecting truffles Three days later he was home   but without his two brothers and his nephew  leaving Mr  Jubori feeling like he had failed his family  A few days later  they were found shot to death  Really  I am eating myself   Mr  Jubori said  adding that in his tribal culture  leaving behind family members is tantamount to betrayal Now in a wheelchair because his feet were badly damaged during his barefoot trek  Mr  Jubori looked bleakly at the M 16 that he had seized Usually  it would have been a prized possession  I lost two of my brothers  my nephew  all I did was save myself   he said   The rifle doesn t mean anything to me  He leaned his head against the wall and began to weep 
 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  When a top aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio was allowed to quietly resign last year over sexual harassment charges  the city decided to keep the reason for his departure secret  Officials said that they wanted to protect his accusers  but the secrecy had another effect  It helped shield the aide from scrutiny as he sought a new job The aide  Kevin O Brien  was the highest ranking city official known to have been ousted over sexual harassment charges in the  MeToo era  but the circumstances of his departure are not unique In at least three other cases in which employees were pushed out because of substantiated sexual harassment allegations in recent years  the city agreed to conceal the behavior from future employers who might inquire as part of a reference check In the three cases  all at the Department of Parks and Recreation  investigators determined that the employees had sexually harassed co workers  and officials moved to have them fired The men challenged their dismissals but ultimately agreed to resign after securing assurances that the city would provide a  neutral reference  to prospective employers seeking information  If asked  city officials would verify only basic details  such as employment dates  job title and description Richard Washington  a lawyer who specializes in city labor cases and represented all three parks employees  said that neutral reference agreements are  something that most attorneys in this field would be requesting   adding that they were relatively common in cases where employees agree to resign after accusations of misbehavior Olivia Lapeyrolerie  a City Hall spokeswoman  acknowledged that beyond the three parks department cases  the city had likely made other neutral reference guarantees with other employees  but said that the city had no comprehensive way to track such cases  While this information is only currently tracked at an agency level  we will be asking agencies to submit their dismissal stipulations to D C A S  moving forward   Ms  Lapeyrolerie said  referring to the Department of Citywide Administrative Services She said that  following inquiries from The New York Times about these cases  the city had decided to hire an outside law firm to review the way it handles requests for references about current or former employees and would seek  to establish more uniform protocols that promote transparency and accountability  Ms  Lapeyrolerie said that under current policy  neutral referrals were given only  in rare instances when they believe any other route could compromise the confidentiality of the complainant  That did not seem to be borne out  however  in at least two of the parks department cases  In those cases  the harassment victims had filed legal papers  either a lawsuit or a notice of claim  which effectively made their cases public and no longer confidential  well before the city negotiated with the men over the terms of their resignation In one of those cases  in 2016  investigators determined that Jeffrey Blount  a parks supervisor  had threatened to fire Makeda Stevenson  a park cleaner  for arriving late to work unless she agreed to have sex with him Two separate investigations  by the parks department s Equal Employment Opportunity office and the Department of Investigation  found that Mr  Blount pressured Ms  Stevenson  a seasonal worker in a welfare to work program  into at least three sexual encounters Ms  Stevenson  a single mother in the program that places low income New Yorkers in temporary jobs  said she was afraid he would retaliate if she resisted  I don t want to do anything to jeopardize my job because I do have to take care of my son  too   she said Even after she was transferred to a different location  at Betsy Head Park in Brooklyn  Mr  Blount tracked her down and cornered her in a park building  where he performed oral sex on her  according to the investigations  Ms  Stevenson used her cellphone to make an audio recording of part of the encounter After Ms  Stevenson s accusations were substantiated  the parks department moved to fire Mr  Blount  he fought back  and took the case to the city s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings  where he could have forced a trial The city entered into a negotiation and Mr  Blount agreed to resign after securing the stipulation that the city would provide a neutral referral to any potential employer   essentially agreeing to conceal Mr  Blount s history of repeated harassment allegations  The determination was made that it was the most prudent course to end Mr  Blount s employment as soon as possible   the parks department general counsel  Alessandro Olivieri  said   I would not describe a neutral evaluation as hiding anything  Ms  Stevenson was stunned when she was told about the arrangement during an interview with The Times   People should know what type of person he is because he s going to continue to do it   she said It was not even the first accusation against Mr  Blount Two years earlier  in 2014  parks department investigators substantiated a claim that Mr  Blount had grabbed and tried to kiss a woman who worked under his supervision as a parks cleaner in Queens  But a department manager later found Mr  Blount not guilty at an internal hearing and he was not disciplined Investigators were also told in 2014 of a separate allegation that Mr  Blount had had improper involvement with yet another subordinate  But that investigation was closed when the woman denied the relationship  Attempts to reach Mr  Blount were unsuccessful A lawyer for Ms  Stevenson  Robert P  Valletti  filed a lawsuit against the city and Mr  Blount in February 2017  in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn  Six months later  the parks department granted Mr  Blount the neutral reference guarantee in exchange for his resignation Ms  Lapeyrolerie said that neutral reference agreements were given to two other men with substantiated sex harassment claims against them  One was a parks supervisor who resigned in 2017  and the other was a park worker named Vincent Lloyde  who resigned in 2015 In Mr  Lloyde s case  a welfare to work employee  Taalibah Thiam  filed a notice of claim with the city in September 2015  alleging harassment  a month later  the city agreed on the terms of Mr  Lloyde s resignation  The following year  Ms  Thiam filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan  alleging that Mr  Lloyde had groped her and threatened to rape and kill her  The court papers said that she told a supervisor and that he did nothing to protect her or stop the behavior The city paid Ms  Thiam a  150 000 settlement to end the lawsuit Neither Mr  Blount nor Mr  Lloyde could be reached for comment  Mr  Washington  the lawyer  said he could not comment on the particulars of any of the three cases The parks department has seen a spate of complaints over sexual harassment  much of it targeting women employed as park cleaners in a welfare to work program known as the Parks Opportunity Program  The problems prompted an inquiry in 2017 by the city s Department of Investigation A July 2017 letter from the investigation commissioner  Mark G  Peters  to the parks commissioner  Mitchell J  Silver  identified  a number of systemic vulnerabilities   Neither the letter nor the investigation has been previously reported In response to that investigation  parks officials agreed to make improvements  including to seek more severe penalties in sexual harassment cases and to create  a watch list of employees with histories of sexual harassment allegations   The letter did not address the practice of guaranteeing neutral references to harassers who resign The case involving Mr  O Brien was different in some key ways from the parks department cases  Mr  O Brien was a management level employee who could be fired at will and could not challenge his firing in the city s administrative trial system Mr  O Brien  who served as the mayor s acting chief of staff in 2017 and later as a senior adviser  also did not have a written dismissal agreement  according to City Hall officials  and was not guaranteed a neutral reference in the same way as the parks workers  The city said that it would tell prospective employers only that Mr  O Brien had resigned in lieu of termination  which Mr  de Blasio said would have been a red flag to prospective employers who inquired Mr  O Brien remained on the city payroll for an additional five weeks after he agreed to resign  This period allowed him to say that he was still working for the mayor as he negotiated a new job with Hilltop Public Strategies  a political consulting firm founded by Nick Baldick  a top campaign adviser to Mr  de Blasio who had first recommended Mr  O Brien for the City Hall job 
Good Tuesday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Trump and Deutsche Bank s cozy tie upPresident Trump has long enjoyed the backing of one major lender  Deutsche Bank  David Enrich of the NYT has taken a deep look into their often turbulent relationship   which is now under investigation by prosecutors and Congress Deutsche Bank courted Mr  Trump when no one else would  He had already gone bankrupt  and no Wall Street lender would back him  But bankers at Deutsche like Mike Offit and Justin Kennedy  the son of Justice Anthony Kennedy  lent him millions  Mr  Trump rewarded some bankers  after some prompting  with a trip to his Mar a Lago resort It issued loans despite finding financial discrepancies  Deutsche Bank officials concluded that Mr  Trump was worth about  788 million  not his self proclaimed  3 billion  And a senior banking executive told Mr  Enrich that he had told others that Mr  Trump had worked with people in the construction industry who were tied to organized crime Only when Mr  Trump sued Deutsche Bank did its investment banking arm drop him as a client  But its private wealth arm  hungry for business  eventually took him back and lent him millions more After the 2016 election  Deutsche Bank executives admitted to problems  They concluded that their colleagues had ignored many warning signs about Mr  Trump  including from internal  exposure reports   Salesmen

court  Bloomberg reports The S E C  says he s violating a court settlement under which it agreed not to charge him with securities fraud  He was supposed to have lawyers vet any Tesla related tweets before he posts them  the S E C  said he hadn t done so even once Mr  Musk had argued that the S E C  s objection was to one tweet  which mentioned previously undisclosed production forecasts  But the regulator said that the settlement was meant to cover a wide variety of his statements  Such brazen disregard of this court s order is unacceptable and unworkable going forward   the S E C  said A

it sees   whether the talks succeed or fail Chip makers fear unintended consequences from one of Washington s key demands  the WSJ reports  that Beijing promise more than  1 trillion in purchases of American goods and services over six years    China has offered to buy  30 billion of U S  chips over six years  industry officials said  essentially doubling U S  semiconductor exports to China     For Beijing to guarantee the sales would require it to put together a kind of quota system  industry officials argued  and that mechanism could later be used to dole out contracts to Chinese firms  But their investors have priced in extra orders from China  Shares in companies like Intel and AMD have jumped in value by as much as 20 percent so far this year as hopes of a trade deal with Beijing have risen  All that could go away if the talks break down So what to do  Chip makers have asked the Trump administration  not to include them  in any agreement over boosted trade quotas  according to the WSJ   They have expressed support for other parts of the trade deal  including protection of intellectual property  ImageDavid Pecker  the C E O  of the National Enquirer s parent company

company  was  concerned Mr  Bezos would sue  forcing debt laden American Media to expend resources to defend itself for a story executives believed was unlikely to sell well on newsstands    He was also advised that publishing the story might make the Enquirer look like it was doing the bidding of President Trump  who has publicly criticized Mr  Bezos   Ultimately  of course  the story was

ON A MID DECEMBER morning at her home studio  which is perched on a wooded hill near Mount Tamalpais in Marin County  Calif   the 98 year old dance artist Anna Halprin was leading a movement class   Think about positive and negative space   she said  observing from a director s chair as her 12 students   a retired preschool teacher  a fine linens importer   assumed a range of positions at once ordinary and not  One woman began to crawl through the parted legs of another  as if a child at recess  while a third communed with the wall  splaying her limbs against its rust colored surface  Warmed up  the class then made its way to the adjacent 1 800 square foot redwood deck that Halprin s late husband  the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin  built in 1952  Since its construction  artistic heirs of Halprin  including Simone Forti  Yvonne Rainer  Trisha Brown and Meredith Monk  have visited the deck at one time or another to practice and move with her  An esteemed teacher and performer  Halprin is known for her use of scores  or task based improvisations  as well as for making dances inspired by nature  Once outside  a pair of students inspected some overhead branches and then offered full body impressions of leaves rustling in the wind It s difficult to see the beginning of things  and this is especially true of artistic movements  which tend to bleed together at their edges  And yet Halprin s deck is considered one of several birthplaces of what would come to be called postmodern dance   an experimental school that posed formal questions about just what dance could be   which otherwise originated in New York in the early 1960s  Its 20 or so most active and influential practitioners were mostly trained dancers working on the fringes of the dance world establishment and their visual artist peers  all of whom recognized that one of the things dance could be was a type of conceptual or performance art  other then burgeoning and medium blurring movements that regarded the three dimensional body as a Duchampian ready made  Together  this group retooled the common dance vocabulary and redefined who might be seen as a dancer  which inevitably had implications beyond the realm of composition  upending assumptions about beauty and bodies at a time not unlike our own  Coming later this spring  the T List newsletter  a weekly roundup of what T

apart from the other arts and consisting largely of ballet  which had been twirling in place since the 1600s until its neo Classical offshoot was developed by George Balanchine  and modern  which the experimentalists felt was overly and falsely expressive   The postmodern movement wasn t exactly a strident dismissal of all that had come before   I think there was a question of   Why do these people take ballet if they re just carrying mattresses around   But I felt it was important for dancers to have a certain discipline   says Childs  Discipline  however  did not mean favoring what was considered a dancerly body  with long legs and good turnout  Postmodern choreographers placed trained and untrained dancers   as well as more  and less toned ones   side by side  dispensing with the makeup and organizational structure of formal companies so as to privilege the mind and movements of the individual  In deconstructing dance  then  they managed to democratize it  We re still feeling the reverberations of that moment   says the New York based choreographer Pam Tanowitz  who might be described as a contemporary postmodernist  In a way  in fact  we re feeling them as much as ever  Postmodern dance developed alongside both artistic and social upheavals  particularly second wave feminism and  though it was not often expressly political about things other than aesthetics    there wasn t a specific agenda   says Childs   the style s early champions  many of whom were women  were seeking alternative ways of moving through space and  by extension  life  Their work is a reminder  as we live through our own reckoning surrounding the control and mistreatment of women s bodies  of the ongoing validity of that search ImageRobert Morris and Yvonne Rainer dance Rainer s  Part of a

Here were movements taken from the street or home and performed by able but merely human bodies in intimate settings   namely at downtown galleries  lofts or the freewheeling Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village  either in the main sanctuary or upon the painted lines of the basement basketball court  As in life  gestures often lacked musical accompaniment  The dancers took many cues from the composer John Cage   most famous for his composition  4 33    in which no music is played for the duration of the title  the only noises coming from the environment surrounding the performance   and from Cage s partner  the choreographer Merce Cunningham  who applied the same theories of indeterminacy found in Cage s music to movement  Cunningham  who would have turned 100 this year  would sometimes flip a coin to decide the next move  giving his work a nonlinear  collagelike quality These were ideas simultaneously being explored in visual art  which was engaged in a similar resetting of boundaries as Pop  Minimalism and conceptual art replaced Abstract Expressionism  with which modern dance was closely aligned  for one  both were preoccupied with working on the floor  as in the paintings of Jackson Pollock and the dances of Martha Graham  Postmodernists remained keen on gravity  however  Certain choreographers would come to treat the floor as a dance partner  just as multidisciplinary artists like Ana Mendieta and Bruce Nauman used it in their performance pieces as a site for symbolic regeneration or heady writhing    Once  after seeing me perform  my father said   Well  that was very nice  but now that you re in your 40s  perhaps you should think about standing up    says Forti   In 1960 and 1961  first at the Reuben Gallery in the East Village and then again at Yoko Ono s Chambers Street loft  Forti showed  Dance Constructions   featuring a choreography centered around a series of physical structures  a slanted board  a hanging rope   which she created after coming across pictures of the Japanese performance artist Saburo Murakami bursting through a row of paper screens  In one of her constructions  an abstracted portrait of a domestic drama  Rainer and the artist Robert Morris  Forti s then husband  bobbed up and down from opposite ends of a wooden seesaw  Forti considered her work as much dance as sculpture  its human performers art objects like any other   but it hardly mattered  since  for this brief and exceptional window  art  dance and music were almost synonymous If postmodern dance s acceptance as visual art was fueled by the form s sheer conceptualism  it was helped along by its genre hopping participants  The 1960s New York art scene was famously small  and disciplines blended together as a result  In addition to Rauschenberg and Morris  visual artists best known as painters and sculptors such as Alex Hay  Carolee Schneemann  Red Grooms and Andy Warhol were all part of the greater Judson scene   Bob  Rauschenberg  was with  the dancer  Steve Paxton and I was with Alex and for a while we were a little foursome   says Deborah Hay   Bob liked to cook for people  so we d go to his place for steak or lobster and then we d all go dancing at Max s Kansas City   As the dance artist Ralph Lemon puts it   The fact that these people were sleeping together doesn t get talked about enough   adding that the exchange between art and dance at that time must have been  visceral  VideoYvonne Rainer s  Trio A  was choreographed in 1966 and performed for the camera in 1978    Yvonne Rainer  courtesy of Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago CreditLemon came up in the late 1970s  when the new new dance was infusing postmodern constructions with overt social commentary  and was greatly influenced by what he calls dance s  lineage of white women   It s true that the downtown scene at that time included few artists of color   uptown  Alvin Ailey was leading his own dance revolution   and it s also true that  simply because they d always been there  women in dance held power not necessarily afforded to those in other artistic realms   We all learned the same movement   says Rainer   By the mid 60s I was having women lift men   Ana Janevski  a curator of the Museum of Modern Art s recent exhibition  Judson Dance Theater  The Work Is Never Done   believes Judson s esprit de corps had a  proto feminist  bent   This was essentially a group of women working together democratically and mining their own lives for material   she says  For Rauschenberg s turtle piece  Brown danced in her wedding dress In time  though  the moment of equilibrium passed and the community collapsed  reality itself acting as a sort of score  After the last Judson dance concert in 1964  Childs taught elementary school for five years to support herself before returning to the field  Rainer s return  following a long career making experimental films  came much later  in 2000  Forti lived for a time in Rome  crossing paths with the Arte Povera movement  and Deborah Hay eventually landed in Austin  where she hosted group workshops  Even in the  60s  says Hay  when visual artists and dancers were intensely collaborative  they were still split over the matter of finances  It was the visual artists who had money  That gap only widened as contemporary art became ever more expensive  and by the 1980s  art institutions had little incentive to invest in something as inherently ephemeral and thus nearly impossible to own as performance  Around this time  Childs professionalized by starting her own dance company and moved increasingly afield from the visual arts community  performing on more traditional proscenium stages  The work  though  remained radical  At one of the early showings of Childs s seminal  Dance   1979   the technically simple leaps and phrases of which create complicated floor patterns that evoke the line drawings of Sol LeWitt  one of Childs s collaborators on the piece  a disgruntled viewer threw eggs THOSE YEARS HELPED us to understand the body not just as a tool for making art but as a battleground  Deborah Hay talks about finding her own language for movement in the post Judson years and about practice as protest   I ve been choreographed as a woman  I ve been choreographed as an older woman  I ve been choreographed as a liberal  I ve been choreographed as a Jew  I ve been choreographed as a single woman  I ve been choreographed as a mother   she says   When I dance  I try to enlarge that choreography   At 77  she still spends every morning in the studio  Eventually  though  so called ordinary movement becomes less so  One of the things that does separate a dancer s work from a painter s  say  is that it must change along with her body  Rainer  now 84  has incorporated text into her recent work and given herself the role of reader  Childs  78  mostly choreographs for others these days  but she danced her 1973 work  Particular Reel  as part of MoMA s Judson exhibition this past fall  her measured gestures still assured and her presence still potent  It is a striking thing to see her and her contemporaries onstage or merely moving across a room  as Forti did during our interview to retrieve a poem she d written that week   knowing we may not have much longer with these witnesses to and architects of an extraordinary time   They re here   says Lemon   Right in front of us  They ve placed these bodies with minimal physical information left to give  and in that requisite reduction is something profound  ImageLucinda Childs performing in

Moore licensed by VAGA at ARS  N Y  courtesy of Paula Cooper Gallery  N Y  This is sort of the last chance to get it all down   Tanowitz says of recent attempts by contemporary companies and art institutions  from MoMA to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis  which have acquired pieces by dancers like Brown and Monk for their collections  to preserve early postmodernist contributions by reconstructing scores and restaging works   Brown died in 2017  but her company lives on  still holding rehearsals in her loft at 541 Broadway   Younger artists have also taken on the responsibility of preservation and recontextualization  In 2017  the artist Adam Pendleton made a video portrait of Rainer that alternates between footage from 1978 of her dancing her minimalist leaning  Trio A  sequence and present day scenes of her reading found text accounting the deaths of black Americans including Eric Garner and Tamir Rice  In this revisiting  Rainer s quick and careful steps become pleas for space in which bodies can move freely  unrestricted by race  gender or immigration status Halprin  who early on saw dance as a social corrective and pathway to personal healing  creating community based work with the arts organization Studio Watts Workshop after the Watts riots of 1965 and with people with AIDS in the  80s  is also attuned to the more minor injustices of modern life   That one s a graphic designer   she said to me of one of the students in her California studio   When else does he get a chance to connect to his spirit  He doesn t   Most of these women are hesitant to describe dancing   and theirs in particular   as spiritual  but  if one has dismissed a technique based approach whereby one dances to become better at dancing  an alternative objective  it was abundantly clear on the dance deck  is joy  How encouraging that this joy might be available to anyone willing to look for it  At the end of class  the students gathered on the deck around Halprin  who was wrapped in a wool blanket coat she wore as a dance student in the Midwest in the 1930s  as she described seeing a rendition of her 1965 work  Parades and Changes   in which a group of dancers slowly undress  performed at San Francisco s de Young Museum last October   My 9 year old great granddaughter was there and has taken to telling her father   You see  Dad  ordinary movement can become art  You just have to do it with awareness   How a Group of Gay Male Ballet Dancers Is Rethinking MasculinityNov  5  2018Bruce Nauman  the Artist s ArtistOct  15  2018How an Eight Month Trip Shifted
