Mueller reaching determination leaves door open Barr come say Mueller make determination issue obstruction collusion going look facts And makes determination case made issues The problem though perception Mueller independent investigator inquiry free politics made call central question But Barr president appointee months making decision question fix Why Mueller come answer attorney general michael barbaroSo beginning last week know Mueller made unusual decision make call And Barr made unusual decision make call And question michael schmidtIt unusual Barr made call The Justice Department decide whether people broke law And What different unusual Barr Mueller look page music michael schmidtMueller make determination issue And Barr looked differently Why Mueller prosecutor one thing prosecutors Justice Department make call nicholas fandosAnd question spent last week trying figure What difference What evidence looking And Mueller Barr make decisions made around question obstruction justice michael barbaroAnd learned nicholas fandosWhat learned nobody happy The team working least team working Bob Mueller feels Barr stepped filled vacuum way properly capture month investigation found And Barr team feels Bob Mueller fell short job michael barbaroSo let start Barr side Explain attorney general around upset michael schmidtSo reaching decision obstruction justice Barr make determination without top cover independent investigator went supposed make determination whether president broke law michael barbaroAnd mean top cover michael schmidtOne reasons special counsel insulate investigation politics investigation concluded way holding product inquiry fruits public saying look done free politics assessed matter based facts And result exposed least part perception president guy made decision michael barbaroThe attorney general michael schmidtCorrect nicholas fandosUndercutting one key points Mueller appointment first place michael barbaroAnd saying people Justice Department Barr upset put position michael schmidtWell system working way supposed You Mueller one reason yea nay crimes And one central questions get And stepping back saying know allows least Democrats say How decision made How get How president political appointee ultimate decider nicholas fandosAnd gives real credence say need see evidence need see whole file president handpicked man made decision Maybe reach different conclusion looked evidence Bob Mueller seems michael barbaroSo Barr choose make call obstruction justice knew upset going seen hyper political fan flames Democrats Congress nicholas fandosThe problem Barr got report looked evidence pretty clear case press kind charge president obstructed justice Now got remember Barr comes job pretty expansive view executive power Democrats made famous wrote memo appointed attorney general arguing certain acts president construed obstruction justice They part executive powers And looked mean make decision Mueller Somebody make choice whether chargeable offense And looked says well judgment team judgment michael barbaroSo Barr reads report thinks talking clear whether obstruction justice There mind clearly nicholas fandosBarr acknowledge evidence basically behavior construed obstructive gives credence Mueller presenting says add tip michael schmidtCriminality nicholas fandos criminal obstructive territory michael barbaroRight And felt political Barr reach conclusion make call Mueller think felt even political Barr mind Congress one perform role And upset make call sounds felt michael schmidtI know upset much looks situation says way supposed working Someone needs make decision whether president broke law step And think based facts nicholas fandosAnd Congress still play role redacting report give sensitive information blacked And make judgment But public intense interest And got say something And decide whether acts broke law And think one michael barbaroDo know Mueller team expected Barr make call obstruction justice declined nicholas fandosWe know precisely Mueller team expected obstruction question seems clear communicating Justice Department wanted may mattered anyway But know Barr came four page summary essentially exonerated president collusion break law obstruction members Mueller team felt inadequately partially represented work month investigation michael barbaroSo side reporting Barr side disappointed Mueller side Mueller side disappointed Barr side nicholas fandosWhat learned since Barr made public statement week ago members Mueller team told associates feel essentially work misrepresentative give full picture believe damaging president attorney general letter lets Now saying every member Mueller team frustrated know Bob Mueller thinks remains one black boxes center investigation But members team involved decision making around issues talking watched disappointed angry characterized michael barbaroAnd focus disappointment degree understand nicholas fandosSo read Bill Barr concise four page letter frustrated drawn work And fact discovered reporting piece prepared summaries work part report handed Justice Department couple weeks ago felt material easily drawn Barr handed made decision whether president obstructed justice criminal sense concurrent put evidence analysis fill public picture The Justice Department says summaries sensitive information classified information secretive grand jury information become public ultimately use michael schmidtSo Mueller folks essentially saying hey wrote summaries going say something investigation going something extreme declarative clearing president include things found michael barbaroAnd specifically include stuff found pretty damning You making seem president anything wrong michael schmidtDonald Trump come days Barr declaration Mueller report beautiful And completely exonerates investigator spent last two years looking Donald Trump think lot questionable behavior something going irritate mightily michael barbaroI mean either think Mueller people legitimate point classic case pride authorship They wanted see work public summary nicholas fandosI think fully know What seems clear reporting specific communication agreement Mueller team Barr team use things things They seem intention And certainly regret But know interaction actual decision making process happened weekend two weeks ago michael barbaroWell think Barr chose include summaries especially negative material four page summary michael schmidtI think one big broad reason another contemporary reason broad reason Barr many Justice Department officials many years prosecutors believe decide charge someone fruits investigation thrown public enemies person investigated michael barbaroDirty laundry aired subject dirty laundry charged crime michael schmidtIf meet incredibly high bar bringing federal prosecution mean get take trash throw street let public rummage michael barbaroAnd Mike contemporary example referred assuming talking James Comey michael schmidtI talking July 2016 press conference James Comey held right heat presidential election stands says done investigation Hillary Clinton use private email account think case made But found questionable behavior handled sensitive national security secrets The press conference seen damaging Clinton even though case never made michael barbaroAnd saying Barr view going one replicate drawing Mueller team summaries putting public sphere michael schmidtCorrect use criminal investigations find damaging things may crimes simply release public used someone nicholas fandosThe problem never normal average criminal investigation broad national security implications And implications almost every decision made highest levels government michael schmidtThis pathway deal president conduct And appears Mueller side saying look president United States There conduct think public Congress see And Justice Department may criminal But president And needs examined thoroughly political process Congress pathway dealing president nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr seem disagree fundamentally throughout wants make much report public possible But think absolves Justice Department role saying whether president campaign broke law And grappling Justice Department aversion talk individuals saying broke law But yet knows public Congress probably owed information happen And kind operating somewhere middle two things michael schmidtThe difference investigation Justice Department determined break law process really needs dealt Maybe company needs decide whether get fired conduct instance another issue president president break law But maybe president things power public know Congress know need closely examined Because maybe breaking law conducted president And Congress need deal And starting see Mueller side frustration hey think bad stuff happened But Barr coming disclosing saying president break law casting die public later look president conduct say several weeks finished report thing Bill Barr saying president break law president turning around saying fully exonerated And saying hey America think process needs play michael barbaroRight michael schmidtSo comes vexing question investigate sitting president And done way public utmost confidence And tension much independence investigator Nixon pendulum swung far president direction Starr investigation Clinton went way The investigator much power And Mueller Barr teams fighting fight different understandings dealt And issue looking years latest episode michael barbaroSo inside one presidential investigation two teams embodying tensions basically present since Watergate nicholas fandosCorrect michael schmidtIt much tell public apparent misconduct president dealt And clear pathway whatever Barr viewed one side political laying brakes president Whatever Mueller viewed president enemies trying get And confidence process erodes And messy And hard figure What real facts What really happened michael barbaroBut point talking summary Bill Barr sent Congress still waiting full report tension describing eventually less resolved learn much information ultimately access nicholas fandosIt may And may see different set facts end day But think question sets narrative intervening period time may end month see fuller version Mueller report And time Bill Barr conclusion president break law going dominant narrative And think hearing members Mueller team concern time fuller work come narrative baked much even shows instance

Last year looked time President Trump delivered promises strengthen economy His tax cuts appeared juice growth percent pace United States topped since 2005 But Thursday Commerce Department revised 2018 growth downward percent even forecasts 2019 trending lower toward percent triggered another wave disappointed commentary doggedly slow growth United States But American story Trump deliver promises even percent growth Across world economists downgrade growth forecasts years since global financial crisis 2008 Defying hopeful projections Japan rarely grown faster percent Europe struggled sustain growth faster percent one quite knows fast China growing clear economy slowing dismal science suddenly guilty issuing overly optimistic forecasts set whole world disappointment Economists keep basing forecasts trends established postwar miracle years growth boosted expanding populations rising productivity exploding debt But population productivity growth stagnated 2008 financial crisis put sudden end debt binge The miracle Politicians often promise bring back golden age serious economists encouraging similar illusion Even Industrial Revolution 19th century world economy rarely grew faster percent year post World War baby boom began rapidly expand labor force After 1950 combination workers output per worker lifted pace global growth percent Economists came think percent normal Yet last decade baby boom faded Europe Japan China Even United States younger faster growing developed countries growth working age population slowed mere percent last year percent early 2000s Because fewer workers correlates directly slower growth decrease implied point drop economic growth Roughly economists expected United States economic growth slow percent percent This new normal American economy Stimulus measures Trump tax cuts lift growth path best temporarily risk higher deficits debt For political leaders new age slow growth problem solve reality need accept explain public Because bad When populations growing slowly economy need grow fast keep incomes high Thus United States decade growth gross domestic product per capita slowed much gradually overall economy half point average percent And though Trump likes boast well United States developed rivals Europe growing fast per capita terms decade Japan growing slightly faster rich country fast enough satisfy people Indeed surveys show Americans rarely confident economy Slower growth working age population means less competition jobs worldwide goes long way explaining unemployment record lows United States Germany Japan Surely bad thing Whatever politicians tell public attempts bring back miracle years ill advised Growth economy driven growth number workers output per worker productivity But since postwar surges 1950s 60s productivity growth slowed defying government efforts lift For time global economy kept motoring along anyway fueled surge debt 1980s central banks began winning war inflation allowed drop interest rates sharply Lower borrowing costs unleashed worldwide binge saw debt surging 100 percent global gross domestic product late 1980s 300 percent 2008 Then global financial crisis hit ruining many private borrowers lenders many still wary taking new debt After growing faster economy three decades debt growth many countries including United States fallen back line economic growth Even China one major country dodged crisis experienced surge lending 2008 reluctant build mountain debt already weighs economy postwar miracle Economic growth weighed baby bust debt hangover Yet economists continue base forecasts miracle rates growth percent world percent United States policymakers keep fighting hit targets This risky There growing calls economists right left lower interest rates increase government spending boost growth even risks higher inflation Federal Reserve emerging view letting inflation rise percent long considered red line may unwise The underlying assumption seems policymakers must take action percent growth intolerably slow But must The confidence surveys suggest Americans quite content record low unemployment benign inflation percent growth gross domestic product per capita Why rush pump money economy risks rekindling debt problems inflation The world need debt inflation counter trends declining population growth high indebtedness Instead economists need adjust forecasts politicians need rethink polices match reality Because trying recreate bygone golden age shaky way build future RelatedMore articles Ruchir Sharma Opinion Ruchir SharmaCasting
