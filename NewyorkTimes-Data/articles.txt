WASHINGTON NEW YORK   U S  investigators sought warrants to read Michael Cohen s emails in July 2017  nine months before the FBI raided the home and office of President Donald Trump s former personal lawyer  according to documents made public on Tuesday The requests were made six months into Trump s presidency  Emails were sought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller s office as well as by the FBI  dating back as far as June 2015  according to the documents  Mueller is investigating Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election and possible coordination with Trump campaign members The nearly 900 pages of documents released by a federal judge in New York provide more detailed accounts of Cohen s financial relationships than previously known Cohen had been Trump s personal lawyer and self described fixer for more than a decade  but began cooperating with federal investigators soon after the April 2018 raids on his home  office and hotel room He later pleaded guilty in separate prosecutions to lying to Congress  bank fraud and campaign finance violations  The latter included paying hush money to silence two women who said they had sexual encounters with Trump Cohen is scheduled to begin a three year prison term on May 6  Trump has denied having had sexual relationships with the two women  Stormy Daniels  the porn actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  and former Playboy model Karen McDougal Much of the discussion about campaign finance issues in the released documents was redacted They were released after U S  District Judge William Pauley on Monday ordered prosecutors to make redacted versions public  in response to requests by news media organizations Lanny Davis  a lawyer for Cohen  said in a statement on Monday night that the document release  only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organisation to law enforcement and Congress  Since pleading guilty  Cohen has publicly turned on Trump  telling the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Feb  27 that his former boss was a  racist    con man  and  cheat  In his congressional testimony  Cohen said he was  ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty  of the things I did for Mr  Trump in an effort to protect and promote him  Cohen began working for Trump in 2007  The Republican president in December called his former lawyer  a rat  and in January said Cohen was  lying to reduce his jail time  Moscow has denied meddling in the 2016 election  though U S  intelligence agencies have concluded that it interfered to help Trump win Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia  and described the Mueller probe as a political witch hunt The newly released documents showed how the FBI made extensive use of its access to Cohen s Apple iCloud account  which allowed him to coordinate his work across such devices as an iPhone  iPad Mini and laptop FBI agents said they located a hotel room in New York s Loews Regency Hotel where Cohen was staying by using a device known as a Triggerfish that mimics cell phone towers to find a specific device The bank fraud case stemmed from Cohen dealings unrelated to Trump  and suggest that his financial situation was dire According to the documents  Cohen was in default by December 2017 on more than  20 million    15 million  in loans backed by New York taxicab medallions he owned The FBI believed Cohen misrepresented his finances to banks he owed money to According to the documents  Cohen concealed fees being paid to Essential Consultants  a firm he controlled  for political consulting  including from international clients with issues pending before the Trump administration  Among the payments Cohen was believed to have received was  600 000 from AT T Inc for consulting about  political issues  including net neutrality  the merger between AT T and Time Warner and tax reform  Another  583 333 came from an investment firm controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg  the documents showed Republicans in Congress have criticized Cohen s consulting work  arguing he should have made his contracts public through disclosures  The warrant does not appear to detail any violations to lobbying disclosure laws Cohen also used Essential Consultants to pay hush money to Daniels   Reporting by Ginger Gibson  Anthony Lin  David Morgan and Andy Sullivan in Washington and Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel in New York  editing by Jonathan Oatis  Will Dunham and Grant McCool

Many high achievers  particularly women and people of color  suffer from impostor syndrome  the fear that they don t belong in the rarefied realm to which they ve ascended and that they will soon be found out  Even Michelle Obama  who is  according to a Gallup poll conducted last year  the most admired woman in America  has said that she feels it   I share that with you because we all have doubts in our abilities  about our power and what that power is   she told students in London in December Well  maybe not all of us  I ve just finished Vicky Ward s  Kushner  Inc    a scintillating investigation of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump s White House sojourn  which comes out on Tuesday  It s full of damning details  contempt for the entitled  venal couple may be the one thing that unites all of D C  s warring factions  Still  the first daughter and her husband remain psychologically mysterious  at least to me  Why don t they have impostor syndrome  given that their total lack of qualifications for the jobs they are doing makes them actual impostors According to  Kushner  Inc    Gary Cohn  former director of the National Economic Council  has told people that Ivanka Trump thinks she could someday be president   Her father s reign in Washington  D C   is  she believes  the beginning of a great American dynasty   writes Ward  Kushner  whose pre White House experience included owning a boutique newspaper and helming a catastrophically ill timed real estate deal  has arrogated to himself substantial parts of American foreign policy  According to Ward  shortly after Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of state  Kushner told him  to leave Mexico to him because he d have Nafta wrapped up by October   As political actors  the couple are living exemplars of the Dunning Kruger effect  a psychological phenomenon which leads incompetent people to overestimate their ability because they can t grasp how much they don t know  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Partly  the Jared and Ivanka story is about the  reality distortion field    a term one of Ward s sources uses about Kushner   created by great family wealth  She quotes a member of Trump s legal team saying that the two  have no idea how normal people perceive  understand  intuit   Privilege  in them  has been raised to the level of near sociopathy Ward  the author of two previous books about the worlds of high finance and real estate  has known Kushner slightly for a long time  she told me that when he bought The New York Observer newspaper in 2006  he tried to hire her  She knocks down the idea that either he or his wife is a stabilizing force or moral compass in the Trump administration  Multiple White House sources told her they think it was Kushner who ordered the closing of White House visitor logs in April 2017  because he  didn t want his frenetic networking exposed   Ward reports that Cohn was stunned by their blasé reaction to Trump s defense of the white nationalist marchers in Charlottesville  Va    He was upset that they were not sufficiently upset  Still  even if you assume that the couple are amoral climbers  their behavior still doesn t quite make sense  Ward writes that Ivanka s chief concern is her personal brand  but that brand has been trashed  The book cites an October 2017 survey measuring consumer approval of more than 1 600 brands  Ivanka s fashion line was in the bottom 10  A leading real estate developer tells Ward that Kushner  now caught up in multiple state and federal investigations  has become radioactive   No one will want to do business with him    Kushner resigned as C E O  of Kushner Companies in 2017  but has kept most of his stake in the business  To truly make sense of their motivations  Ward told me  you have to understand the gravitational pull of their fathers  Husband and wife are both  really extraordinarily orientated and identified through their respective fathers in a way that most fully formed adults are not   she said Among the most interesting parts of  Kushner  Inc    are the chapters about the business history of Charles Kushner  Jared s felonious father  and his plan to restore his reputation  with Jared s help  after getting out of prison in 2006  Part of that rehabilitation project was the purchase of a flagship building in Manhattan   666 Fifth Avenue  an absurdly on the nose address   for which the family paid a record amount at the very height of the real estate market in 2007  When the Great Recession hit  the building became a white elephant  its debt threatening the family fortune Ward s book suggests that the search for someone who would bail out 666 Fifth Avenue has played a significant role in American foreign policy during the Trump administration  And since the completion of her book  we ve learned that Trump overrode intelligence officials  who were concerned about Kushner and his family s ties to foreign investors  to give Kushner a security clearance More from Opinion on Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump Opinion   The Editorial Board  Questions For and About Jared KushnerMarch 6

Contrary to the views of most economists  the Trump administration expects the U S  economy to keep booming over the next decade on the strength of further tax cuts  reduced regulation and improvements to the nation s infrastructure The annual report from President Donald Trump s Council of Economic Advisers forecasts that the economy will expand a brisk 3 2 percent this year and a still healthy 2 8 percent a decade from now  That is much faster than the Federal Reserve s long run forecast of 1 9 percent annual economic growth The administration s forecast hinges on an expectation that it will manage to implement further tax cuts  incentives for infrastructure improvements  new labor policies and scaled back regulations   programs that are unlikely to gain favor with the Democratic led House that would need to approve most of them Kevin Hassett  chairman of the White House council  insisted that the president s economic agenda would provide enough fuel to drive robust growth at a time when the majority of economists foresee a slowdown due in part to the aging U S  population He said the biggest risk to growth would be if financial markets anticipate that Trump s existing policies would be reversed  Without getting into specifics  Hassett said the risk would be if markets expect that the winner of the 2020 presidential election would shift away from policies such as the tax overhaul that Trump signed into law in 2017  Uncertainty over the policies themselves could slow their positive impact   Hassett said The tax cuts added roughly  1 5 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade  not accounting for economic growth  The report suggests that the lower tax rates have increased business investment in ways that will make the economy more productive  while also creating a surge in people coming off the sidelines to search for work The administration s optimism comes amid signs of slowing global economic growth  as well as a recent slowdown in manufacturing production and weakness in retail sales in January and December 
COEBURN  Va    Former coal miner John Robinson s bills for black lung treatments run  4 000 a month  but the federal fund he depends on to help cover them is being drained of money because of inaction by Congress and the Trump administration Amid the turmoil of the government shutdown this winter  a tax on coal that helps pay for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was cut sharply Jan  1 and never restored  potentially saving coal operators hundreds of millions of dollars a year With cash trickling into the fund at less than half its usual rate  budget officials estimate that by the middle of 2020 there won t be enough money to fully cover the fund s benefit payments As a surge of black lung disease scars miners  lungs at younger ages than ever  Robinson worries not only about cuts to his benefits  but that younger miners won t get any coverage  Coal miners sort of been put on the back burner  thrown to the side   Robinson said recently  sitting at his kitchen table in the small Virginia town of Coeburn  near the Kentucky border   They just ain t being done right  President Donald Trump  who vowed to save the coal industry during the 2016 campaign  has repeatedly praised miners  At an August rally in West Virginia filled with miners in hard hats  he called them  great people  Brave people  I don t know how the hell you do that  You guys have a lot of courage  Trump made no mention of restoring the 2018 tax rate in his proposed budget released in mid March The White House said in a statement Tuesday that  President Trump and this administration have always supported the mining industry by prioritizing deregulation and less Washington interference  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  whose home state of Kentucky is third in the nation in coal production  told a reporter from Ohio Valley ReSource in October the tax rate would  be taken care of before we get into an expiration situation  That didn t happen  McConnell spokesman Robert Steurer didn t repeat that pledge this week  rather  he wrote in an email   benefits provided through the Black Lung Disability Fund continue to be provided at regular levels  and that McConnell  continues to prioritize maintaining and protecting the benefits  Trump and McConnell have reaped large contributions from the coal industry  according to the political money website Open Secrets Trump received more than  276 000 during the 2016 presidential election from political action committees and individuals affiliated with coal companies  His inaugural committee received  1 million from Joe Craft  CEO of Alliance Resource Partners in Tulsa  Oklahoma  and  300 000 from the Murray Energy Corporation  the nation s largest privately owned coal mining company McConnell received more than  297 000 in coal industry donations since 2014  when he was last up for election Congress established the trust fund in 1978  Until the rate expired  money came from an excise tax of  1 10 per ton on underground coal and 55 cents on surface mined coal that brought in  450 million last year  Rates fell to about 50 cents and 25 cents when lawmakers failed to act on its Dec  31 expiration date The fund provides health benefits and payments to about 25 000 retired miners  Most worked for companies that are now bankrupt  Many  including Robinson  struggle to breathe as their lungs are slowly stifled by tiny dust and particles trapped there Robinson was 47 when he was diagnosed  part of a wave of younger miners that doctors and experts say have been swept up in a new black lung epidemic in Appalachia  Robinson  now 53  and others who depend on the fund are disappointed in McConnell and other leaders who typically enjoy miners  support  I just feel that Mitch McConnell has let the citizens of Kentucky down  especially the miners   said Patty Amburgey  whose husband  Crawford  died of black lung disease at age 62 in 2007  She draws a monthly widow s payment through his black lung disability benefits   And now there s an epidemic of black lung  Dr  Brandon Crum has watched that epidemic unfold at his Pikeville  Kentucky  radiology clinic  In less than four years  Crum has seen 200 miners diagnosed with a severe form of black lung disease  called pulmonary massive fibrosis  The nation had 31 such diagnoses in the 1990s  according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  We re looking at men in their 30s and 40s on oxygen  being evaluated for lung transplants   Crum said   Those are usually middle age individuals with younger families  so it affects their wives  a lot  His findings were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a December 2016 report that showed a shockingly high level of severe black lung cases at his clinic Amburgey  of Letcher County  Kentucky  said there will be fewer benefits for the growing number of younger miners with black lung if the fund is depleted  Robinson said he s now worried the trust fund s  pot of money will dry up  West Virginia Sen  Joe Manchin and other coal state Democratic senators are pushing a bill to shore up the fund by restoring the larger tax for 10 years  Manchin said in a statement that lawmakers  cannot continue to allow these solutions to be put off again and again   That bill is in a Senate finance committee The mining industry supported the increased tax rate s expiration  calling the effort to maintain it an unnecessary tax increase  The National Mining Association  which speaks for the industry  says the lower rate  will be sufficient to cover monthly benefit costs for the fund   The group argued extending the rate would lead to job losses The May 2018 GAO report contradicts that claim  saying the fund s beneficiaries could multiply  due to the increased occurrence of black lung disease and its most severe form  progressive massive fibrosis  particularly among Appalachian coal miners  The increase in younger black lung sufferers will put more pressure on the fund  as the industry continues to shrink  I think people always thought they would get  black lung  if they worked long enough in the mines  but I think it s a disease they thought would affect them at the end of their life  in their 70s or 80s   Crum said Amburgey says Trump reneged on his pledge to support miners  Mr  Trump promised that he would bring the mines back and take care of the miners  and that is not happening   she said   He promised us a snowball in July     
WASHINGTON   Top U S  trade and economic officials will visit China late next week for another round of negotiations  a White House official said Tuesday Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will lead the delegation  Trump administration officials said  The sources spoke on background because they weren t authorized to comment publicly The scheduled talks suggest the two sides believe they can make at least some progress  President Trump said Thursday at the White House that   Talks with China are going very well  But the negotiations are also taking place in late March  a period when administration officials had previously hoped to sign an agreement at Mar a Lago  the president s Florida resort  Business lobbyists say an agreement now probably won t be reached until late April  I would say perhaps the month of April   Larry Kudlow  the top White House economic adviser  said on C Span Friday   It s not in cement  The trade dispute began last year after the U S  listed a number of complaints  including that China engaged in outright theft of U S  trade secrets and forced companies to transfer technology in exchange for access to its market  Trump imposed tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese imports  about half what the United States buys from that country  China retaliated with tariffs on about  110 billion of U S  items Administration officials say they speak with their Chinese counterparts on a nearly daily basis  Business lobbyists say that a key sticking point is what type of enforcement mechanism will be included in the agreement  The Trump administration  they say  wants to have the option to impose tariffs on Chinese goods if China doesn t abide by the terms of the pact  The U S  also wants China to promise not to retaliate against those tariffs Still  business groups say the talks are making progress  We are cautiously optimistic that the two sides are going to get there   said Jeremie Waterman  president of the U S  Chamber China Center   They re clearly whittling the number of outstanding issues down  A report released Friday estimated that the trade war will likely damage the U S  economy  Analysts at the Rhodium Group  in conjunction with the U S  Chamber of Commerce  estimated that the tariffs  if they remained in place  could cost the United States a cumulative  1 trillion in economic output over the next decade Even if the tariffs are soon lifted  the report estimates that they will shave  50 billion  or 0 3 percent  off this year s economic output The duties would also not bring back production of information technology hardware to the United States  the report found    AP Writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report 
KUWAIT CITY   The United States  attempts to isolate Iran  including by punishing Iraqi militias and politicians who are supported by Iranian officials  has deepened tensions not only between Washington and Baghdad but also within the Trump administration American military and intelligence officials said the increasing pressure on Iraq risks infuriating its Parliament  including politicians linked to Iran  which could limit the movements of the 5 200 United States troops based in Iraq Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  whose confrontational stand on Iran has already strained ties with European allies  is leading the push for Iraq to confront its fellow Shiite majority neighbor  He arrived in the Middle East on Tuesday to speak with officials in Kuwait  Israel and Lebanon about containing Iran Under plans recommended by Mr  Pompeo and some White House officials  the State Department would designate Iran s military Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization  It would be a first instance of the United States designating a unit of another government s military as a terrorist group  American officials said it could put United States troops and intelligence officers at risk of similar actions by foreign governments The plans also would designate some Iraqi Shiite militias as foreign terrorist organizations  As a result  the Iranian trained militias   and Iraqi officials who support them   would be subject to new economic sanctions and travel restrictions The proposal was described to The New York Times on condition of anonymity by a half dozen American and Iraqi officials and experts familiar with the sensitive diplomatic plans but not authorized to discuss them by name Mr  Pompeo confirmed Monday night that he was looking at various groups  including the Revolutionary Guards in Iran  after he was asked by The Times on the flight to Kuwait about the proposed designations  There may well be other organizations that we designate   he said  The State Department designated an Iraqi group as a terrorist organization this month  despite opposition from the Pentagon The Iraqi militias   some of which were trained by the Revolutionary Guards   operate with Baghdad s approval or financial support  Several are legitimate players in Iraqi politics  They are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces  an umbrella organization of about 50 paramilitary groups that fought against the Islamic State  a radical Sunni group  and are paid by the Shiite dominated Iraqi government  The Americans can make the decisions they want  but what the Americans see is different than what we see   Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said last week   Our position on the Popular Mobilization Forces is very clear and well known  Officials at the Pentagon and the C I A    which Mr  Pompeo ran in the Trump administration s first year   oppose designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guards or the Iraqi militias as terrorist groups  fearing a backlash that could constrain American troops  Qassim Suleimani  commander of the corps  elite Quds Force and a regular visitor to Iraq  has been designated a terrorist by the United States ImageMike Pompeo  the secretary of state  has told Iraqi leaders they must stop buying Iranian natural gas  a major energy source for power starved Iraq CreditWin Mcnamee Getty ImagesIraqi leaders were already irate over the Trump administration s insistence that they comply with American sanctions imposed against Iran after President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Tehran Tensions between Washington and Baghdad have only risen through the winter In February  Iraqi politicians bristled after Mr  Trump said American troops in Iraq would monitor and pressure Iran  Iraqi leaders are resisting demands by Mr  Pompeo to stop buying energy from Iran   another issue on which Pentagon officials have sided with Baghdad  Iraq officials also remain unhappy by the closing of the United States Consulate in Basra  the country s second largest city  where a temporary halt of electricity exports from Iran led to violent rioting last summer On Friday  a senior State Department official said Mr  Pompeo s visit to the Middle East this week was part of the goal of rolling back Iran s forces and linked Shiite militias  As with Iraq  the pressure campaign has angered leaders in Lebanon  where Iran backed Hezbollah is a major military force  holds parliamentary seats and runs the health ministry Analysts said Mr  Pompeo s trip and its focus on Iran is an attempt to lend Trump administration support to embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel before national elections set for April 9  Iran and Israel are longtime enemies  Mr  Pompeo has denied such intentions Mr  Pompeo has told the leaders of power starved Iraq that they must stop buying Iranian natural gas and electricity  But on Tuesday  following recommendations by senior Pentagon officials  he agreed to extend a waiver of the sanctions to allow Iraq to buy electricity from Iran  The new waiver will expire in 90 days  in the middle of Iraq s scorching summer If they are forced to stop buying electricity from Iran  Iraqi officials warned  protests could destabilize the government of Mr  Abdul Mahdi  who was named prime minister in October  In February  he said Iraq would not comply with the sanctions  citing the 13 years of United Nations sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein that took a bruising toll on Iraqis throughout the country Iraqi officials now are exploring how to buy natural gas from Iran but still protect Iraqi banks from American penalties This month  against the advice of officials at the Pentagon  the State Department announced that it was designating an Iraqi militia  Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba  and its leader  Akram Abbas al Kaabi  as  specially designated global terrorists   The group is funded by the Iraqi government  but the State Department said its loyalty was to Iran Mr  Pompeo also is seeking to designate a more significant group  Asa ib Ahl al Haq  as a terrorist organization  Asa ib Ahl al Haq won 15 seats in Iraq s Parliament last year  Though its officials now say they tolerate the United States military presence in Iraq  the militia fought American troops at the height of the Iraq war  The militia is led by Qais al Khazali  a former American detainee who is accused of masterminding an ambush in the holy Shiite city of Karbala that killed five American soldiers in 2007 After Mr  Trump announced in December that he would withdraw United States forces from the fight against the Islamic State in Syria  American officials began quietly negotiating with Iraqi counterparts to shift hundreds of commandos and support troops to Iraq  The initial urgency for the shift has cooled  however  now that Mr  Trump has agreed to leave 400 American troops in Syria rather than withdraw all 2 000  But many Iraqi lawmakers are reluctant to give the 5 200 American troops already in Baghdad and at a handful of other bases much freedom to move or operate The terrorist designations could complicate talks over those issues and a range of diplomatic matters by fueling animosity toward the United States  One senior American official said the designations could lead to barring members of the Iraqi and Iranian governments from traveling to the United States   including to the United Nations in New York Administration lawyers have been poring over the proposed language for the terrorist designations and their possible consequences  So far  that has kept Mr  Pompeo from issuing them  two senior American officials said  One official said that trying to enforce the sanctions that the terrorist designations would prompt would be a nightmare

In recent decades  the sleek  wide eyed vaquita porpoise has been pushed to the brink of extinction by poachers pursuing another critically endangered sea creature  the totoaba  a fish whose swim bladder sells on the Chinese black market for thousands of dollars  The porpoises end up caught in nets intended for the totoaba and killed as collateral damage  The vaquita  its name is Spanish for  little cow   is a toothed whale and the smallest of all cetaceans  a full grown female can measure just five feet and weigh only 75 pounds  Thousands of vaquitas once plowed the Sea of Cortez  also known as the Gulf of California  which is bordered on the east by the Mexican mainland and on the west by the Baja California peninsula  Today  their numbers are estimated at around 10 but no more than 22 in the wild  Without a strictly enforced ban on even possessing gillnets  the species will soon go extinct in the wild  Just last week  the badly decomposed body of what was thought to be a vaquita was found caught in a gillnet There is little time left to act to save the vaquita  yet there is hope  For Mexico s new president  Andrés Manuel López Obrador  the fate of the little porpoise represents political opportunity and the chance of failure  He can do nothing and preside over the first sea mammal extinction in North America in decades  Or he can save one of Mexico s national symbols and rescue a troubled fishing industry   This is doable even now   said Brooke Bessesen  a conservationist and author of a new book   Vaquita  Science Politics and Crime in the Sea of Cortez    We have to come up with solutions that buy time  This is not a numbers game  It s a game of time  The Sea of Cortez is 62 000 square miles of azure and turquoise water that ranks as one of the most productive fisheries in the world  with more than 900 species of fin fish  including blue marlin and whale sharks  Commercial fishing started in earnest in the 1940s and is largely concentrated off the Mexican state of Sonora  on the eastern shore of the sea  But poachers are generally thought to be the problem these days The small scale fishermen who live on the sea s western and northern shores motor out in cheap fiberglass skiffs known as pangas  armed with gillnets  These nets  made from near invisible nylon mono  and multifilament  float on or near the surface and are weighted at the bottom  They kill indiscriminately  entangling everything from sea lion pups to great white sharks  Today  there are so many abandoned nets that the government pays fishermen to drag them ashore Poor poachers still use gillnets to catch the totoaba  whose swim bladder sells for  20 000 on average in China for traditional medicine and even as investments  A bladder is both a high end business gift and a sort of trophy in itself  The trade is so lucrative that the drug cartels have become involved in the poaching  Last April  Mexican authorities stopped a Chinese man at the Mexico City International Airport with 355 totoaba swim bladders  Three days later  another Chinese man bound for China had 417 swim bladders in two suitcases  And in December  Chinese officials confiscated 980 pounds of swim bladders  estimated to be worth  26 million  Sixteen people were arrested So it is no wonder that poachers and their gillnets have pushed the totoaba onto the list of critically endangered species maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature  and dragged the even more endangered vaquita along with it  The tiny porpoises drown when they are snagged in these nets The Mexican government shares some of the blame  Warnings that the vaquita might vanish arose years ago when there were still hundreds in the wild  but it failed to take effective actions to protect them  Mr  López Obrador s predecessor  Enrique Peña Nieto  banned the use of gill nets in the porpoise s habitat in 2015  for instance  but not their possession An attempt to capture porpoises to breed them in captivity in 2017 led to one dying  another nearly did and had to be released  The  totoaba  however  is being bred in captivity  giving the species a path to survival  But that effort is likely to be counterproductive for the vaquita  because it will only encourage more poaching of the totoaba The vaquita s situation is so dire that Thomas A  Jefferson  a San Diego marine biologist and conservationist  said he feared that extinction was its most likely fate   The conservationist in me doesn t want to admit that but the biologist has to   he said Yet the vaquita clings to life  In October  four were spotted in open water  The little porpoise may possess a unique genetic advantage that could allow it to recover in the wild if just left alone  The vaquita was never widely distributed  numbering perhaps only 5 000 at its modern height and located only in the Sea of Cortez  But there is no evidence that it has hit the bottleneck of birth defects from inbreeding often seen in declining populations And so  there is hope   if President López Obrador acts swiftly  The vaquita is one of Mexico s national animals  along with the golden eagle and the jaguar  He s under economic pressure to do so  But by acting aggressively to save the porpoise  he can also fulfill core campaign promises and emerge a hero  not just in Mexico but around the world   Pressure is coming from the United States  Last year  the United States Court of International Trade in New York temporarily banned seafood imports from Mexico caught in the Sea of Cortez with gillnets  The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by environmentalists complaining that the Trump administration was not enforcing a 1972 law that protects marine mammals from being killed in the process of fishing  It has been a crippling blow to the fishing industry in the Sea of Cortez  blocking an estimated 1 400 tons of seafood worth  300 million from being sold in the United States  Even before that  the grocery retailer Trader Joe s had banned blue shrimp from the Sea of Cortez from its nearly 500 stores because of concerns that vaquitas were being killed in gillnets intended for shrimp Even if he wasn t facing that economic pressure  saving the vaquita represents an opportunity for the new president  Mexican presidents cannot run for re election  so Mr  López Obrador is at the zenith of his power at the start of his six year term  By banning the possession of gillnets  Mr  López Obrador would slow the killing of both the totoaba and the vaquita and perhaps resolve the trade dispute with the United States  By expanding the practice of paying more fisherman to remove ghost nets  he would put idle anglers to work  By allowing video of illegal fishing to be used as evidence in court   it is now not admissible   the Mexican Navy could make poaching arrests stick  And by managing the fishery wisely  he would keep it producing for Mexicans and foreign markets alike  Already this kind of fishery management is taking shape in parts of Sonora  There has to be some way  But this comes down to López Obrador   said Ms  Bessesen  the author   He is the remaining flicker of hope for the vaquita  So  yes  there is hope  But in the Sea of Cortez  there is little time for either the president or the porpoise  Richard Parker is the author of  Lone Star Nation  How

BRUSSELS   European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen said on Tuesday that Washington s  selfish  approach to trade was not sustainable  but it was too early to say that EU U S  trade talks were doomed to fail The Trump administration has imposed stiff tariffs on U S  imports of steel and aluminium and set off a trade war with China in a bid to redress what it sees as unfavourable terms that contribute to a U S  trade deficit of over half a trillion dollars a year  The Commission  which negotiates trade agreements on behalf of the 28 nation European Union  has been in talks with U S  authorities since last July  seeking to clinch a deal on industrial goods trade EU governments are now discussing the details of a negotiating mandate for the Commission  while Washington has until mid May to decide whether to make good on President Donald Trump s threat to impose tariffs on imports of European cars  It is too early to say that our trade discussions are doomed to fail   Katainen told a regular news briefing  There are discussions going on on several levels and     we can end up having some sort of an agreement with the U S  on trade  but let s not go deeper than this   he said  adding that the scope of negotiations had to be clear and that a deal would require a lot of good will and political capital on both sides Asked about a reform of the World Trade Organization  WTO   Katainen said it was problematic and that attempts to get it done were like pushing a rope  Japan  China and the EU are willing to reform the WTO  the U S  has not been that interested  but they are willing to cooperate   he said  Even though the U S  authorities may think that selfishness is better than cooperation  it is not a sustainable way of thinking  We need better  rules based trade in the future where the international community sets the rules   he said U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress last week that the WTO was using an  out of date  playbook despite dramatic changes including the rise of China and the evolution of the internet He said Washington was nonetheless working  diligently  to negotiate new WTO rules to address these problems   Reporting By Jan Strupczewski  Editing by Kevin Liffey 
ROME   Russia and the United States remain split on how to resolve the crisis in Venezuela  officials from both powers said Tuesday after talks in Rome Elliott Abrams  the Trump administration s special envoy to Venezuela  met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov to discuss the situation in the Latin American country  We did not come to a meeting of the minds  but the talks were positive in the sense that I think both sides emerged with a better understanding of the other s views   Abrams told reporters after the meeting at a luxury hotel in Rome He said it s  perfectly plausible  that the two sides meet again but no date was set Russia backs Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and has accused Washington of meddling in the country s affairs by pressing him to step down and hand over power to opposition leader Juan Guaido Speaking to Russian media  Ryabkov emphasized the need for dialogue with the U S  but warned Washington against military intervention President Donald Trump has said  all options are on the table  regarding Venezuela  which Russia interprets as a refusal to exclude military force  Ryabkov said  We have warned the U S  against that reckless approach   Ryabkov said in remarks that were carried by the state Tass and RIA Novosti news agencies Abrams insisted the U S  will continue to keep its options open  but said it has chosen the path of putting political  financial and diplomatic pressure on Maduro s regime Earlier  Abrams met with government officials from Italy   one of four European Union countries that have not backed Guaido as Venezuela s interim president   and paid a visit to the Vatican  He noted that the Catholic Church enjoys respect and credibility in Venezuela  but said it s unclear what role if any the Vatican could play in its political crisis Pope Francis has reportedly written to Maduro indicating conditions aren t ripe for the Vatican to step in and help mediate Also Tuesday  the U S  added a Venezuelan state owned mining company to a growing sanctions list as it seeks to increase pressure on Maduro The new sanctions bar any U S  citizen or entity from any financial transactions with the gold mining company known as Minerven and its president  Adrian Antonio Perdomo Mata The U S  Treasury Department said the company is helping to prop up Maduro  who alleges that he is the target of a U S  coup plot    Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Ben Fox in Washington contributed to this report 
TIJUANA  Mexico SAN DIEGO   Three asylum seekers due to be returned to Mexico after appearing in U S  immigration court on Tuesday asked officials to let them stay in the United States because they feared for their safety while waiting out the process in Mexico The requests are a new approach by migrants in response to President Donald Trump s recent policy that requires people seeking protection in the United States to wait for their U S  court dates in Mexican border towns  part of his hard line stance to halt migration  Some 240 people   including families   have been returned to Mexico since late January under the program  dubbed Migrant Protection Protocols  MPP   according to U S  officials Six Central American migrants who crossed from Tijuana through the San Ysidro port of entry had their cases heard at a San Diego courthouse in the program s first day of hearings on Tuesday  All were told to return to Mexico  Robyn Barnard  a lawyer from the nonprofit group Human Rights First  said she asked officials to let her two Honduran clients stay in the United States  Both are afraid of returning to Tijuana to wait for their next hearings in early August  Tijuana  like much of Mexico s northern border zone  has seen extensive bloodshed since the federal government began using the military against drug cartels over a decade ago   Mexico is not a safe place for all people  and there are vulnerable groups at risk   Barnard told reporters after the hearing Her clients would remain at a U S  Port of Entry on Tuesday night  ahead of interviews with asylum officers  likely the next day  Barnard s assistant said  One client  19 year old Ariel  said he left Honduras because of gang threats and gave only his middle name because he feared reprisals  He was among the first group of asylum seekers sent back to Mexico on Jan  30 and given a notice to appear in U S  court in San Diego  God willing everything will move ahead and I will be able to prove that if I am sent back to Honduras  I ll be killed   he said prior to the hearing  Mariel Villarreal  an immigration lawyer with San Francisco based Pangea Legal Services  said she asked that her client from Guatemala be allowed to stay in the United States   They are just being sent back to homelessness in Tijuana   she said  adding that Mexican officials are not explaining how returnees can earn work permits U S  officials have said they are working with the Mexican government to ensure migrants are safe while they wait in Mexico  But some Mexican officials have warned the country s border cities would struggle to look after asylum seekers for long periods   GENEROUS  LAWSThe American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups are suing in federal court to halt the MPP program  which is part of a series of measures the Trump administration has taken to curb the flow of mostly Central American migrants trying to enter the United States The administration says most asylum claims  especially for Central Americans  are rejected  but because of immigration court backlogs people are often released and live in the United States for years waiting for their cases to be resolved The government has said the new program is aimed at ending  the exploitation of our generous immigration laws  Critics say the program violates U S  law and international norms because migrants are sent back to often dangerous towns in Mexico where it is difficult to keep track of their U S  court dates and to find legal help Gregory Chen  director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association  said there are real concerns about carrying out this major shift in U S  immigration policy  The government did not have its shoes tied when they introduced this program   he said Immigration advocates are watching how the proceedings will be carried out this week  especially after scheduling glitches created confusion around three hearings last week  according to a report in the San Diego Union Tribune The Executive Office for Immigration Review  EOIR   which runs U S  immigration courts under the Department of Justice  said only that it uses its regular court scheduling system for the MPP hearings and did not respond to a question about the reported scheduling problems   Reporting by Lizbeth Diaz in Tijuana and Jose Gallego Espina in San Diego  writing and additional reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York and Daina Beth Solomon in Mexico City  Editing by Bill Trott and Darren Schuettler

ERBIL  Iraq   American backed forces in northern Syria have captured a group suspected of organizing a bomb attack that killed four Americans and a number of allied Syrian militia fighters in January  a spokesman for the local forces said on Tuesday The spokesman  Mustafa Bali  wrote on Twitter that his group  the Syrian Democratic Forces  had used  technical surveillance  to find and arrest the suspects The bombing  on Jan  16  was the deadliest attack on Americans in Syria since Washington began a military campaign against the jihadists of the Islamic State in 2014  and it occurred in an area the United States had considered safe  Identifying those involved could help explain how the jihadists were able to strike far from their last stronghold The arrests were first reported by Reuters  A United States military official confirmed that Syrian allies had captured a small number of people linked to the attack in recent days but provided no further detail Col  Sean Ryan  a spokesman for the American led military coalition against the Islamic State  declined to comment further  citing in an email a continuing investigation In the attack  a suicide bomber entered a popular restaurant in the Syrian town of Manbij where American military personnel had stopped during a patrol to eat with their local Syrian allies The Americans killed were a military linguist who worked with the National Security Agency  a member of the Army Special Forces  a former Navy SEAL who did intelligence work for a Pentagon agency and an Arabic interpreter who worked for a private defense contractor At least 11 Syrians were also killed  most of them members of the Syrian Democratic Forces  a Kurdish led militia that has been working with the United States to fight the Islamic State Mr  Bali did not say how many suspects there were  or when or how they had been arrested The arrests come at a critical juncture for the future of the United States presence in eastern Syria President Trump has said that he wants to withdraw the roughly 2 000 American troops posted there  although that plan has been repeatedly revised  leaving American allies and even many United States officials confused about what Washington s policy is  Recently  the Trump administration has said that it is planning to leave 400 troops in Syria to continue working with American allies and to stop Iran and its allies from making inroads in the area It remains to be seen whether the American withdrawal will accelerate after the defeat of the Islamic State s last patch of territory  On Tuesday  officials from the Syrian Democratic Forces said the jihadists  territory had been reduced to a small patch of land along the Euphrates River near the village of Baghuz But the battle there has lasted much longer than predicted  and tens of thousands of fighters and civilians have surrendered as the jihadists  territory has dwindled  Most of the men are in prison and most of the women and children are in overcrowded refugee camps

SAN DIEGO   Several asylum seekers who are being forced to wait in Mexico while their cases wind through U S  immigration court told a judge Tuesday that they are afraid to return to Mexico as they await their next hearing   a development that introduces a new wrinkle to a major U S  policy shift The seven cases being heard in a downtown San Diego courtroom are among the first to advance under the Trump administration policy that calls for people seeking asylum in the U S  to be held in Mexico The initial appearances came three days before a federal judge in San Francisco is set to hear arguments by advocacy groups to halt the policy Attorney Robyn Barnard asked for access   at least by telephone   to any interviews conducted with her Honduran client with U S  officials about whether his fears of returning to Mexico are well founded Jason Aguilar  an attorney for U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  didn t object but deferred the request to other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection said it wouldn t comment due to pending litigation  and Citizenship and Immigration Services had no immediate comment The developments raised more questions about the administration s new approach to handling the claims of people who say they fear returning to their homelands because of danger related to race  religion  political beliefs  nationality or membership in particular social groups The administration hopes that making asylum seekers wait in Mexico will discourage weak claims and help reduce an immigration court backlog of more than 800 000 cases  Currently  families are typically released in the U S  with notices to appear in court and can stay until their cases are resolved  which can take years Critics say asylum seekers are forced to wait in unsafe environments and will struggle to find legal advice while in Mexico  Tijuana had more than 2 500 homicides last year The policy shift was introduced as families from Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador arrive at the U S  border to seek asylum Five of the seven people who were scheduled to appear Tuesday were represented by attorneys  Six were Honduran  one was Guatemalan Gerson Alonzo Beltrand of Honduras  who had Barnard speak on his behalf  expressed fear of returning to Tijuana  but the government attorney s response left unclear whether Homeland Security would grant his request  A judge scheduled an Aug  6 hearing on the merits of his asylum claim  Sir  we made significant progress in your case this afternoon   Rico Bartolomei  chief immigration judge in San Diego  told him The Associated Press witnessed one of the seven cases in the small courtroom before security guards cleared the aisles of an overflow crowd Lisa Knox  an attorney for two Honduran men  was in the courtroom and said three asylum seekers had expressed fear of returning to Mexico Knox said the judge continued her cases to early May to give her more time to prepare  One man failed to appear because he was in U S  custody in another part of the country The policy change  which followed months of high level talks with Mexico  has been introduced slowly with an average of 40 people a week being returned to Tijuana from San Diego in the first six weeks  Mexico agreed to accept up to 120 a week U S  officials began returning people to Mexicali  Mexico  from Calexico  California  last week and say they intend to sharply expand such activity across the entire border Mexicans and children traveling alone are exempt from the policy U S  and Mexican officials characterize the policy change as a unilateral move by the Trump administration  Mexico has said it will allow asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for humanitarian reasons    AP photographer Gregory Bull contributed from Tijuana  Mexico 
DEIR AL ZOR PROVINCE  Syria   U S  backed Syrian forces said they were close to defeating Islamic State in its final scrap of territory at Baghouz in eastern Syria after seizing an encampment from the jihadists on Tuesday  though the battle was not over yet Hardened militant fighters holed up in the encampment had been mounting a last stand defense of the Baghouz enclave  all that is left of Islamic State s self proclaimed  caliphate  that once spanned a third of both Syria and Iraq  This is not a victory announcement  but a significant progress in the fight against Daesh   said Mustafa Bali  a media official with the U S  backed Syrian Democratic Forces  SDF  on Twitter  using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State Bali said late on Tuesday clashes were ongoing and that fighters remain  in several pockets and their presence is not limited to a defined geography   The SDF captured hundreds of wounded militants when it overran the camp on Tuesday  Bali said  It also captured 157 mostly foreign fighters Footage obtained by Reuters showed dozens of people milling around the captured camp  preparing their belongings to leave in a convoy of trucks  None of those visible appeared to be armed  Men believed to be Islamic State fighters  women dressed in black robes and some children stood around the shabby camp area next to high rocks strewn with bits of tents and vehicles  A few of those visible used crutches or sticks to walk Footage from another part of the camp showed burnt out cars  dozens of abandoned vehicles  shattered buildings and tents made out of blankets  Asked by Reuters how long it would take to defeat the remaining jihadists  Bali said he expected the operation to end  very soon   adding that some remaining militants had fallen back to the bank of the nearby Euphrates River  The battles are not yet over   he said   Some of the terrorists have taken their children as human shields  There are intermittent clashes   GRAPHIC   How Islamic State lost Syria   https   tmsnrt rs 2O7l4mNMILESTONEIslamic State s fighters and followers have been steadily forced back to Baghouz after years of retreats in the face of military campaigns by an array of foreign and local forces The group s defeat at Baghouz will mark a milestone in the struggle against the jihadists  although adherents are still widely seen as a big security threat with a presence in remote territory and capable of mounting guerrilla attacks The capture of Baghouz will also mark a significant moment in the wider Syrian war  wiping out the foothold of one of the main combatants and leaving Syria partitioned between President Bashar al Assad  Kurdish led forces  and Turkey backed rebels Diehard jihadists have been mounting a desperate defense of the camp at Baghouz  deploying suicide bombers and car bombs Over the past two months  more than 60 000 people have poured out of the dwindling enclave  nearly half of whom surrendered as Islamic State supporters  including some 5 000 fighters  according to the SDF  Even facing defeat  Islamic State s propaganda machine still functions  An audio recording released overnight purported to carry a message from spokesman Abi al Hassan al Muhajer saying the group would stay strong and urged fresh attacks It has also put out a video from inside the Baghouz camp  showing bearded fighters among bullet pocked cars and lying on earth ramparts as they fired assault rifles  Against this scene  a man with a scarf wrapped around his head declaims a message of defiance   The crusaders have forced us from our homes and burned us  may God exact the same from them     O Muslim brothers everywhere  we have done our duty  Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of neighboring Iraq said images showed Islamic State had built tunnels in Baghouz big enough for vehicles   The advance is slow and the battle could take days to finish   he told a press conference in Baghdad RISK OF RESURGENCE The U S  military has warned that Islamic State may still count tens of thousands of fighters  dispersed throughout Iraq and Syria  with enough leaders and resources to present a menacing insurgency The Pentagon s own internal watchdog released a report last month saying Islamic State remained an active insurgent group and was regenerating functions and capabilities more quickly in Iraq than in Syria  Absent sustained  counterterrorism  pressure  ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to 12 months and regain limited territory   it said  using another acronym for the group U S  officials said U S  backed forces had captured fighters tied to a January suicide bombing at a cafe in Syria that killed four Americans  The attack in the city of Manbij was the worst single incident involving U S  personnel in Syria since they deployed on the ground there in 2015 It occurred nearly a month after President Donald Trump confounded his own national security team and allies with a surprise decision to withdraw all 2 000 U S  troops from Syria  declaring Islamic State had been defeated there  Washington has now partially reversed Trump s decision  planning to leave 200 peacekeepers in SDF held territory

JERUSALEM   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pays a visit to Israel this week but it s what he s not doing while there that may be the most notable aspect of the trip Pompeo doesn t plan to talk publicly about the  deal of the century  that President Donald Trump said he would offer to settle the Israel Palestinian conflict  a plan so important that he delegated negotiations to his senior adviser and son in law  Jared Kushner  Look  we desperately want a good solution   Pompeo told reporters Tuesday before his plane landed in Kuwait City for the first stop of the trip   Mr  Kushner s working on the Middle East peace plan  There ll be a right time when we will introduce bigger pieces of that  Pompeo s Israel itinerary is characteristic of the administration s approach to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  which has been largely private and without participation from the Palestinians The secretary won t even meet with any Palestinian officials on this trip  something that would have been routine for any top U S  diplomat in recent decades Pompeo s mere presence in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just weeks before a national election may be symbolic of the administration s political preference  but his main public message will be a familiar one  The U S  has an unbreakable commitment to Israel s security no matter who s in charge  I m going to Israel because of the important relationship we have   he said   Leaders will change in both countries over time  That relationship matters no matter who the leaders are  He said he would spend a good deal of time speaking about the security challenges posed by the conflict in Syria ahead of a sharp reduction in the U S  presence there  as well as about the longstanding threats Israel faces from Iran and the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah Palestinians wouldn t meet with Pompeo even if he wanted to see them  They have severed ties with the administration over its recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital  moving the U S  Embassy there from Tel Aviv and slashing hundreds of millions of dollars of aid  Political relations with the U S  administration are broken unless it backs down from its decisions on Jerusalem and refugees and abides by international law   said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas s spokesman Nabil Abu Rdeneh For now  the only apparent interaction between U S  and Palestinian officialdom seems to be an increasingly frequent stream of tweets from international negotiations envoy Jason Greenblatt  taking issue with Palestinian positions and criticism  most of which he says is incorrect  relies on faulty hearsay or is otherwise intended to deceive  The message is that those who spread misinformation about the conflict or the plan are not going to get away with it anymore   said Greenblatt  who is leading the talks with Kushner  in an interview last week   If you lie or deceive to try to shape public opinion  we re not going to let you do that without a response  We are in the midst of educating  and in some cases  re educating people  Greenblatt brushed away criticism of the tweets from former would be peacemakers and diplomats with experience in the region who say such engagement is undignified  In some cases it might be more useful to provide information behind closed doors  but they won t engage with us that way   he said   But more importantly  they are speaking loudly and publicly  so why should the U S  not say something publicly and respond to accusations  misinformation or manipulation  The peace plan itself doesn t yet exist  at least not outside a small circle of top White House aides led by Kushner and Greenblatt  They insist the plan is real but won t say when it will be presented other than after Israel s April 9 election  But officials note there is only a narrow window between the election  the start of the weeklong Jewish holiday of Passover in late April and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan  which starts in early May  That means the plan is likely to be delayed further In the meantime  Kushner and Greenblatt have begun to preview the nonpolitical elements of the plan to interested parties  including Israelis  Palestinians outside of the Palestinian Authority  Arab countries that will be critical to the economic part of the plan  and the Jewish and evangelical Christian communities in the U S  that staunchly back Israel Administration officials familiar with that outreach say each group has its own issues and concerns  They add that Greenblatt and Kushner have their work cut out for them as they try to promote a peace plan for which they are unwilling to provide details  particularly on the most sensitive parts of what must be in an eventual deal  the status of Jerusalem  Palestinian refugees  territorial sovereignty and borders Those officials  who were not authorized to speak publicly about the effort and spoke on condition of anonymity  conceded that early discussions had produced some unease  particularly as Greenblatt and Kushner make clear that both Israel and the Palestinians will have to make hard compromises to achieve peace Suggestions that the plan will not explicitly call for a two state solution  which is favored by most of the international community  and instead offer the Palestinians something less in return for massive economic investment have not sat well with veteran Mideast hands  The architects of Trump s deal of the century believe that s old think   said Martin Indyk  a former U S  ambassador to Israel and the second of the Obama administration s three Mideast peace envoys   Their idea is that the Palestinians can be persuaded to forgo their national aspirations in return for normalcy and prosperity funded by the Arab states

NEW YORK   A woman who climbed the base of the Statue of Liberty last July 4 to protest the separation of families at the Mexican border came to her sentencing Tuesday with her face entirely covered with clear sticky tape  irritating a judge who refused to proceed until she removed it After she did so  U S  Magistrate Judge Gabriel W  Gorenstein spared Therese Okoumou from prison for her conviction on multiple misdemeanor counts though he berated her for what he thought was a lack of concern for rescuers whose safety he said she jeopardized As she stood before him with a white headband across her forehead scrawled with the phrase  I care   he ordered her to perform 200 hours of community service and five years of probation  leading her attorney  Ron Kuby  to suggest the judge might be seeing a lot of them in the future  I think there s hope  otherwise  the judge responded  saying he would be willing to shorten the probation term at a later point if Okoumou did not commit more crimes Given a chance to speak in court  Okoumou called the case against her  a fraud against injustice   an explanation for her continuing protest and the tape she had earlier painfully pulled off her face  I m not a criminal   she told Gorenstein When Gorenstein took a break from the bench before announcing the sentence  Okoumou stood and turned around to face several dozen supporters before raising her fist in the air The gesture silenced the supporters  who raised their fists in return as everyone stood for a moment before Okoumou blew a kiss to them and turned around to await her sentence Outside court  she was surrounded by supporters as she railed the immigration policies of the Trump administration  saying they re what prompted the Statue of Liberty protest  We have people in cages  What was I supposed to do   she said   I made my point      Find your own conscience  Don t look up to me  The nearly four hour demonstration forced an evacuation of 4 330 people from the statue grounds on one of its busiest days of the year As he announced his sentence  Gorenstein noted that Okoumou repeatedly ignored orders to descend from a perch at the feet of the statue that was high enough that a prosecutor said it could have seriously injured or killed her or tourists below  New York Police Department rescuers were forced to climb a rickety ladder and gird themselves like mountain climbers to safely bring her down The judge said she tried to push down the ladder  jeopardizing rescuers Prosecutors noted in presentencing papers that since Okoumou s arrest  she has twice climbed the Eiffel Tower in Paris  France  forcing its evacuation  and has climbed onto the roof of an Austin  Texas  building  leading to another arrest in which charges are pending The Texas climb led to her being subjected to electronic monitoring in New York  though Gorenstein ordered the removal of the device Tuesday Kuby said Gorenstein was overestimating the danger to rescuers posed by his client s statue climb  The lawyer called them the most elite rescuers  on the planet  
WASHINGTON   A divided Supreme Court ruled Tuesday against a group of immigrants in a case about the government s power to detain them after they ve committed crimes but finished their sentences The issue in the case before the justices had to do with the detention of noncitizens who have committed a broad range of crimes that make them deportable  Immigration law tells the government it must arrest those people when they are released from custody and then hold them while an immigration court decides whether they should be deported But those affected by the law aren t always picked up immediately and are sometimes not detained until years later  In the case before the Supreme Court  a group of mostly green card holders argued that unless they re picked up essentially within a day of being released  they should be entitled to a hearing where they can argue that they aren t a danger to the community and are not likely to flee  If a judge were to agree  they would not have to remain in custody while their deportation case goes forward  That s the same hearing rule that applies to other noncitizens the government is trying to deport But the Supreme Court disagreed with the immigrants  interpretation of federal law in a 5 4 ruling that divided the court along ideological lines  Looking at a statutory provision enacted by Congress in 1996  Justice Samuel Alito wrote that  neither the statute s text nor its structure  supported the immigrants  argument  The court s conservative justices sided with the Trump administration  The administration argued  as the Obama administration did  that those affected by the law aren t entitled to a hearing where they can argue for their release  regardless of whether they are arrested immediately after being released from custody or not Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the administration was  pleased with the decision  Justice Stephen Breyer  in a dissent he read aloud in court  said that the larger importance of the case has to do with the power his colleagues  ruling gives the government  It is a power to detain persons who have committed a minor crime many years before  And it is a power to hold those persons  perhaps for many months  without any opportunity to obtain bail   Breyer said He wrote that in his view the law requires immigrants who have committed crimes to be detained  within a reasonable time after their release  from custody   presumptively no more than six months   If the person is not detained within that time  they should get a hearing where they can argue for their release  Breyer wrote The American Civil Liberties Union represented the immigrants in the case before the Supreme Court  ACLU attorney Cecillia Wang  who argued the case  said after the decision that the ACLU will call on Congress to clarify the law and will continue to pursue options in court Tuesday s ruling was based on the text of the statute  and Wang said the ACLU will argue that the statute  as interpreted by the justices  is unconstitutional  Wang also called the decision an  extreme waste of taxpayer money   saying it locks up individuals who are not a danger to the community The case before the justices involved a class action lawsuit brought by noncitizens in California and a similar class action lawsuit brought in the state of Washington  In those cases  the U S  Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided with the immigrants  but other appeals courts had sided with the government in similar cases One of the lead plaintiffs involved in the California case  Mony Preap  has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1981 and has two convictions for possession of marijuana  He was released from prison in 2006 but was not taken into immigration custody until 2013  Preap has since won his deportation case  allowing him to remain in the country The case is 16 1363 Nielsen v  Preap    
COLUMBIA  S C    Former Virginia Gov  Terry McAuliffe said Tuesday that he ll soon decide whether to join the sprawling field of candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination  I ve said clearly  in the next couple of weeks  I ll make the final determination   McAuliffe said during a visit to the Statehouse in South Carolina  home of the first Southern presidential primary of 2020   So  I m traveling around  but out of all those early states  I have a lot of strength here in South Carolina  McAuliffe  62  began popping up in early voting states late last year  campaigning with candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire as he explored a possible run for the White House  In January  the longtime Democratic power player used his old state political action committee to raise big money and cut checks to Democrats in both states  with campaign finance reports showing the PAC raised  300 000 in the second half of 2018 Part of the pitch McAuliffe said he s making to power brokers in early voting states is his ability to make Democratic inroads in Virginia  under Republican control for nearly two decades  In the 2017 elections  the last of McAuliffe s four year tenure as governor  15 House of Delegates seats shifted from Republican to Democratic control  reducing the GOP s majority to two seats  I took a red state and made it blue   the former Democratic National Committee chairman said   We had the biggest pickups in 140 years under my four years as governor  and if we did it there  we can do it here in South Carolina  Some have expressed concern that it could be difficult for McAuliffe to garner broad based popularity in the wake of the political crisis that engulfed three of Virginia s top Democrats  turning the state that has trended toward the left back into a potential battleground in the upcoming presidential race  Voters could take this out on Democrats     less as an ideological shift but more as an issue of repercussions for genuine political scandal   Josh Schwerin  who worked for McAuliffe  said earlier this year Last month  President Donald Trump gleefully agreed  predicting in a tweet that he will reclaim a state he lost by 5 percentage points to Hillary Clinton in 2016   Democrats at the top are killing the Great State of Virginia   he tweeted   If the three failing pols were Republicans  far stronger action would be taken  Virginia will come back HOME Republican  in 2020  Part of McAuliffe s calculus could be timed around an expected announcement from former Vice President Joe Biden  with whom many of McAuliffe s potential supporters may also fall politically in line  Like Biden  McAuliffe is largely seen as a centrist Democrat angling to tap into a network of supporters and donors cultivated over the last three decades during the Clinton and Obama administrations  During an event Monday at George Mason University in Virginia  McAuliffe said he believes Biden  is 95 percent  in the race   but he hasn t made a 100 percent decision to do it  As part of his trip to South Carolina  McAuliffe met with House members and planned to make a stop at Allen University  a historically black school in Columbia  Later Tuesday  he was expected to attend a reception at the home of longtime Democratic activists Don and Carol Fowler  Don Fowler chaired the DNC in the 1990s  His wife  Carol  headed the South Carolina Democratic Party in the 2000s  We re sort of getting the lay of the land  seeing old friends  firing folks up and seeing where we go   McAuliffe said    Associated Press writer Christina L  Myers contributed to this report

that it was canceling plans to build a major campus in Queens  the company did not directly blame any one person or group But others have Governor Cuomo  who with Mayor de Blasio helped negotiate the deal largely in private  blamed the State Senate  where crucial leaders opposed the plan Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  who opposed the campus  blamed Amazon for seeking  3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that she said should have been spent elsewhere Now a poll is offering insight into how the public feels about the deal s collapse  Over a third of New Yorkers point the finger at Ms  Ocasio Cortez  according to a Siena College Research Institute survey of 700 voters Here s what else you need to know about the poll  which was released yesterday The deal was popular across the state  Two thirds of voters said Amazon s withdrawal was bad for New York Sixty three percent of Democrats and 56 percent of self identified liberals said the cancellation was bad for New York Sixty four percent of New York City voters agreed with them Blame fell on Ms  Ocasio Cortez  Thirty eight percent of voters faulted the congresswoman for the deal s demise  identifying her as a  villain    Local activists in Queens  were labeled villains by 34 percent of voters In the New York City suburbs  50 percent of voters blamed Ms  Ocasio Cortez  Upstate  the number was 40 percent  in the five boroughs  it was 29 percent A spokesman for Ms  Ocasio Cortez declined to comment on the poll results What about the governor and mayor  Mr  Cuomo and Mr  de Blasio were each seen as a villain by fewer than 30 percent of voters What about Amazon  The company was blamed by 26 percent of voters The takeaways   The progressive base that cheered Ms  Ocasio Cortez as she railed against the deal was not representative of most voters  Those closest to a project don t necessarily reflect the views of a wider audience   said Steven Greenberg  a pollster with Siena College   I asked Mr  Greenberg if by  closest  he meant physical proximity  and he replied   Yes      Local activists in Queens  were blamed more often for the plan s demise than the State Senate was  In the suburbs  39 percent of voters labeled the activists as villains  but only 23 percent labeled the Senate as such This matters in part because Democrats need to retain suburban seats to hold on to their Senate majority The

should be seen separately  really in a way   is unclear at the moment  The case is more than 60 years old  but some at Cardozo say it shouldn t be forgotten  Today at 4 p m   the law school will

After more than a week of near silence  Dennis A  Muilenburg  the chief executive of Boeing  made his first substantive public comments about the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 In a statement released by Boeing on Monday night  Mr  Muilenburg expressed remorse for the deaths of 346 people in two strikingly similar air disasters involving the company s 737 Max jets   the accident in Ethiopia  on March 10  and the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia in October  Our hearts are heavy  and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board   Mr  Muilenburg said The investigations into the causes of both crashes are still in progress  and no conclusions have been reached by the authorities  But preliminary data suggests that a combination of new software  faulty sensor readings and inadequate pilot training may have been to blame French air accident investigators confirmed on Monday that flight recorder data from the Ethiopian Airlines jet showed  clear similarities  with the Lion Air jet The B E A   the French agency that investigates aviation crashes and incidents  said in a statement that the investigation team had noted these similarities  during the verification process  of data from the flight recorder  which keeps information like altitude and speed Mr  Muilenburg said Boeing was  taking actions to fully ensure the safety of the 737 Max   based on the information the company got from the investigations Among those actions is a software update that has been in the works for months  in response to the Lion Air crash  He said the update was due  soon  Mr  Muilenburg had been conspicuously quiet since the latest crash  as regulators around the world grounded Boeing jets and the company s stock slumped 12 percent He did make time to call President Trump twice   first on Tuesday of last week to press the president to keep the 737 Max jets flying  and a day later to encourage their grounding But on Monday night  Mr  Muilenburg for the first time appeared to try to reassure the public   Safety is at the core of who we are at Boeing  and ensuring safe and reliable travel on our airplanes is an enduring value and our absolute commitment to everyone   he said   This overarching focus on safety spans and binds together our entire global aerospace industry and communities  After the crash in Indonesia  Boeing faced tough questions about the development of the 737 Max  and a flight control system known as MCAS in particular  which will get the promised software upgrade  Other questions are being raised about the company s training procedures  When the plane was introduced  Boeing believed that pilots who had flown an earlier model didn t need additional simulator training and regulators agreed Many experts believe MCAS played a role in that first crash  But the Max jets continued to fly  reflecting the confidence of Boeing  regulators and pilots that the planes were beyond reproach But Boeing was thrust into a crisis last week when another jet crashed in nearly identical circumstances  Boeing s newest jet  its best seller  is now grounded  airlines are demanding compensation  and there is no clear timetable for the return of the Max planes And in a development that could have far reaching implications  Canada s aviation regulator is reviewing its validation of the American certification of the 737 Max  Marc Garneau  the transport minister  told reporters on Monday  We may not change anything  but we think it s a good idea to review that at this time   Mr  Garneau said

was involved in two deadly accidents in five months michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  As Boeing developed a new line of passenger jets  it was determined to avoid costly training for pilots  Then  two of those jets crashed  It s Tuesday  March 19 natalie kitroeffThe global aerospace business is essentially a duopoly  There are two big companies  There s Boeing  which is American owned  and there s Airbus  a European rival michael barbaroNatalie Kitroeff is a business reporter at The Times natalie kitroeffThese two are always competing with each other  They are competing on every single aspect of an airplane  And they re often competing for the same customers  music natalie kitroeffSo in late 2010  archived recordingWe re not redesigning the A320  It s pretty damn good just the way it is  What we re doing is offering new  more fuel efficient engines on today s airplane natalie kitroeff  Airbus announces that it is offering a new  fuel efficient version of its best selling A320 plane archived recordingWell  an A320neo  natalie kitroeffIt s going to be the A320neo archived recordingIt s a new engine option offered on today s A320 family of aircraft  And now they re being offered with new  more fuel efficient engines  We re putting our money on re engining the world s best selling single aisle aircraft natalie kitroeffThis amounts to essentially a frontal assault for Boeing  Fuel savings mean that airlines are saving on costs  And if Airbus is going to offer an option that is going to save airlines money  Boeing better will come up with its own alternative in order to compete in this cutthroat environment  where they have one main rival michael barbaroSo what does Boeing do in response to its biggest and most important rival coming up with this fuel efficient jetliner natalie kitroeffBoeing scrambles to respond quickly archived recording MUSIC  We are making a decision to invest in the 737 family natalie kitroeffAnd within months  the company comes up with an upgrade of its own archived recordingMax efficiency  which leads to profitability  max reliability  and to the flying public  max passenger appeal natalie kitroeffIt s going to be a fuel efficient version of their 737 workhorse  It is going to have bigger engines  And it s going to save airlines money on this fuel archived recordingThe best single aisle airplane in the world   MUSIC natalie kitroeffAnd they re going to call it the 737 Max  And one of the main goals of this engineering process is to keep this new plane as similar to its predecessor as possible michael barbaroWhy natalie kitroeffPart of the reason is that Boeing is competing with Airbus  And they re competing with them on every single cost item  And a plane is not just metal and technology  It s also what it costs to operate the aircraft and to train pilots to fly it michael barbaroHm natalie kitroeffIf the 737 Max turned out to be so different from its predecessor that it required training on a flight simulator  one of these giant machines where you have a cockpit and it mimics the experience of flying the plane  it would cost airlines tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft  It s incredibly expensive  So if Boeing were to say  we have this beautiful new jet  but it s going to require twice the amount of training that the Airbus model requires  the executives might pause on that  So as the company is manufacturing this plane  it wants to find ways to make it fly exactly the way that its predecessors did michael barbaroSo that there is not a need for training natalie kitroeffExactly  And there s a little bit of a problem  music natalie kitroeffThere is something that is fundamentally different about this plane  Its engines are bigger  and those engines need to be mounted farther forward on the wings  And that changes the aerodynamics of the plane  So the placement of those engines makes the nose of the plane push upward in certain circumstances  And that can lead to a stall  which is a dangerous situation  So Boeing has to come up with a solution to make the plane act the way its predecessor did and to counteract that force  So what it does is it comes up with this system  this software michael barbaroAnd what does the new system do natalie kitroeffThe new system automatically corrects for that upward motion of the nose  And it pushes the nose down automatically  And it s supposed to be working in the background  in a way that pilots don t even notice  correcting for an issue that was not in the prior model of this plane  And it s supposed to be something that is just keeping the pilot in a position where he or she feels as though the plane is flying in the same exact way under the same conditions that the prior model did michael barbaroSo Boeing thinks even though the engines are different  that they have developed a system that makes the engines operate essentially the same way the old 737 did  And from a pilot s point of view  therefore  there would be no need for new training natalie kitroeffYes  Boeing believed there was no need for extra training for pilots who had flown the previous model  And the Federal Aviation Administration agreed  In March 2017  the F A A  certified the plane  It did not require flight simulator training for pilots who had flown the prior model  And regulators around the world followed suit  Two months later  Boeing shipped out its first 737 Max out of Seattle  And the company decided that it does not need to fully inform pilots that this new software even exists michael barbaroHmm  So they don t even tell the pilots  They think it is so unimportant to the operation of the plane from the experience of a pilot that they don t even need to know natalie kitroeffYes  music michael barbaroSo what happens next  This plane is certified  on the market  What happens archived recordingWell  it s wheels up for Boeing s new 737 Max natalie kitroeffOrders come pouring in from across the globe archived recordingBoeing says the Max 8 is the company s fastest selling plane in its history  with nearly 4 700 orders for more than 100 customers across the world natalie kitroeffAnd carriers make this the best selling Boeing jet ever archived recording100 737 Maxes expected to be sold to AerCap  That s a lessor from the Netherlands  Also  Korean Airlines expected to order 30 of those natalie kitroeffPilots love it archived recordingIt flew beautifully  Its engines were extremely quiet natalie kitroeffIt is a hit archived recording 1Still  take a look at shares of Boeing  which  archived recording 2Are up  And up today natalie kitroeffThey re enjoying a ton of success in the stock market archived recording 14Logged orders or commitments for almost 400 aircraft  with a total sticker price of more than  37 billion natalie kitroeffInvestors love them  customers love them   until October 29  2018  when Lion Air Flight 610  a 737 Max carrying 189 people  takes off and  12 minutes later  crashes into the Java Sea archived recordingThree days after Lion Air Flight JT610 mysteriously disappeared before plummeting into the sea  there may be hope for answers michael barbaroWhat do we learn about what went wrong on that flight archived recordingMilitary personnel have found one of the black boxes natalie kitroeffSo a picture begins to emerge of this flight that suggests that the pilot may be fighting with that system archived recordingFlight data shows the on board computers were pushing the plane s nose down  Then the pilots aimed the nose higher  That happened 26 times  with the crew never following procedures to correct the problem natalie kitroeffSo while the software is pushing the nose down  the pilot is trying to push it back up over and over and over again  multiple times  That is the picture that begins to emerge  But we do not have full conclusive evidence yet michael barbaroSo it seems like the pilots on this flight are fighting a flight control system  a self correcting one that s supposed to keep the nose from going up  that they don t even know exists  right natalie kitroeffThat s exactly right  And what experts believe was happening was that this system was taking in a faulty sensor reading  So it was responding to bad data  And that is why it kept triggering over and over and over again  despite the pilot s best efforts to get the plane back on course michael barbaroAnd eventually those pilots lose their battle against the system natalie kitroeffEventually  the plane plunges into the sea  killing all 189 people on board  music michael barbaroWhat  Natalie  is the reaction among the airlines that have bought this line of planes to this emerging realization that Boeing hadn t revealed what turned out to be this important piece of information  the existence of this system that may likely have contributed to this crash natalie kitroeffPilots are furious   livid  in fact   that they have not been informed that this thing even exists  So they have these meetings  in which they told Boeing officials that this was a breach of trust and that it was disrespectful michael barbaroSo I have to assume that these angry pilots  in addition to just wanting to be sure everyone knows about this system  are demanding training so that they can properly respond to this system natalie kitroeffNo  they re not  The F A A   Boeing  nobody is recommending more training on this system michael barbaroWhy not natalie kitroeffThe American pilots that I ve talked to  they believe that because they ve been informed about the system  now that they know how it works  they are able to safely fly this plane  They know how to deal with this software if it becomes an issue on their flights  And they feel confident about flying the plane  This is a confidence that s  in part  based on statistics and experience  There has been only one fatality on U S  airlines in the last decade  Boeing has an enviable safety record  In many ways  they had good reason to be confident  And they re also promised a fix to the software that pushes the nose down  That s going to come within the next several weeks  They will be informed of it  And they feel confident that that is enough michael barbaroO K   so after this Lion Air crash  the only thing that changes is that Boeing vows to fix the system  But no additional training is ordered for any pilot anywhere  And the 737 Max planes are free to keep flying natalie kitroeffYes archived recording 1A jet has crashed  and the tragedy is being felt around the world archived recording 2U S  aviation investigators and a technical team from Boeing are headed to Ethiopia tonight  That s where a new 737 Max 8 jetliner crashed today  minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa archived recording 3Killing everyone on board  Flight 302 was en route to Nairobi  Kenya  when it crashed in the town of Bishoftu just six minutes after takeoff  The plane was carrying 149 passengers and 8 crew members natalie kitroeffImmediately  it becomes apparent that there are some similarities between this flight and the Lion Air crash archived recording 1Preliminary data shows a  quote   clear similarity  to the Lion Air Max 8 crash off Indonesia in October archived recording 2Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts archived recording 3What we now understand is what people had suspected  that there are certain similarities between the Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian crash earlier this month michael barbaroWhat are those similarities natalie kitroeffSo the pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported flight control problems  So that was a first clue  The plane is also moving in the same way that the Lion Air plane was  up and down  The speeds are changing rapidly  suggesting that the pilot may have been fighting with this system  again  with the pilot trying to pull the nose up  and the system pushing it down  Then there is physical evidence recovered at the site of the crash that seems to suggest that the nose was being pitched down  We don t know why  But again  it all points to this system being involved  potentially contributing to another tragedy michael barbaroAnd so what is the reaction this time  after the second crash of a 737 Max natalie kitroeffBoeing stands firm behind the plane  And American carriers are right there with them  But  archived recordingChina has grounded its entire Boeing 737 Max fleet natalie kitroeff  regulators around the world seem a little less confident  The Chinese and Indonesians quickly ground the 737 Max archived recordingMore countries following China s lead and grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet natalie kitroeffOnce the Europeans follow  archived recordingEuropean Aviation Safety Agency  they have banned flights of the 737 Max series  adding to similar groundings by China  Indonesia  Australia  Malaysia  the U K   Singapore  New Zealand  France  Germany  Italy  Ireland  Netherlands  Turkey  I could go on natalie kitroeff  American regulators are all of a sudden under immense pressure for the F A A  to ground these planes archived recording  donald trump Boeing is an incredible company  They are working very  very hard right now  And hopefully  they ll very quickly come up with the answer  But until they do  the planes are grounded michael barbaroAll of this looks very bad for Boeing  obviously  And it seems to stem from this original motivation  as you described it  to avoid classifying this new energy efficient plane that would compete against Airbuses as fundamentally different from older models of the 737 that would require expensive training of the pilots  even though a very crucial part of the plane was different natalie kitroeffThat s right  This motivation to keep this plane as similar as possible to its predecessor permeated the entire engineering process  Remember  this is how Boeing needs to compete with Airbus  It s also raising questions about the entire process for certifying aircraft in the United States  There is renewed scrutiny on the closeness between the F A A  and Boeing  The F A A  and Boeing work together to certify planes  The F A A  actually relies heavily on Boeing employees to help certify its aircraft michael barbaroAnd is that basically industry practice  Companies that make these planes work with the Federal Aviation Administration on the approval process natalie kitroeffThat s exactly right michael barbaroHmm natalie kitroeffI mean  folks were talking about this  right  But nobody was kind of raising red flags  I mean  it wasn t like people were up in arms about the way that this certification system works  But now there s been two crashes of the same model in less than five months  And we re hearing more and more from regulators and former regulators about how this close relationship may be too cozy michael barbaroNatalie  what do we know about the role that Boeing s employees played specifically in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max natalie kitroeffWe know that Boeing plays a critical role in helping to certify its aircraft  And we are learning more and more about the role that it played in the case of the 737 Max  The Seattle Times recently reported that not only was the F A A  relying heavily on Boeing in this case  but that Boeing itself was turning out an analysis that was downplaying the potential risks of a software system that is now at issue after these two crashes michael barbaroHmm natalie kitroeffThe F A A   like any federal agency  has a limited budget  And there s a reason why it would want to rely on the people who are most informed about the inner workings of increasingly complex aircraft in order to determine whether that plane is airworthy  You can see why you would need a relationship  and one where there is a lot of information sharing  right  Because the one side can t employ as many people as Boeing does  And the other side has a ton of expertise  But is that relationship too close michael barbaroRight  And there seems to be a lot of trust at the center of this system you re describing that allows Boeing to basically be like a co regulator of itself  And the most important trust involved here seems to be that a business will always put safety above profits  And I guess the question here is whether in a system with that much trust  that balance could get out of whack  and safety might lose out to profits  And the only way we would know that is when there s a tragedy or two tragedies natalie kitroeffBoeing doesn t want planes to crash  So their motivations are  in many ways  exactly aligned with their customers   But what s emerged after these two crashes   I mean  you heard the pilots  They said this was a breach of trust michael barbaroRight natalie kitroeffI think a lot of people are feeling that right now  that feeling of questioning of this process  And this isn t to say anything about Boeing s motivations  We are at the very beginning of investigating these two flights  and we do not want to rush to conclusions  But you re asking the questions that the people at the front line of this industry  the pilots  the crew  they re asking that right now  How do we regain trust in Boeing  And how do we know for sure that we are being told everything we need to know in order to fly these planes michael barbaroWe ve been talking about trust  the trust that the F A A  had in Boeing  that the airlines  their pilots and crews had or didn t have in this plane  But I m wondering now about the trust that we  as the flying public  have in these planes  And it s kind of hard to imagine wanting to fly on a 737 Max anytime soon  Let s say that the software gets fixed  And Boeing and the F A A   through their certification process  they all sign off on everything being safe  Why should we trust them after that  Why should we trust them  kind of  ever natalie kitroeffI think that coming up with the software fix is manageable for Boeing  an industrial juggernaut that has dealt with these issues before  And you ll remember  the 787 Dreamliner was grounded for three months in 2013  when it had battery fire problems michael barbaroAnd that was a Boeing plane natalie kitroeffRight  a Boeing plane  And we all fly on it  It s possible that people will be wary right now  But Boeing has the capacity to fix this thing and probably will  The bigger question is whether these two tragedies lead to a more wholesale transformation in the process for regulating the aircraft manufacturers in this country  What  if anything  is going to change in the process by which we determine  in the United States  that planes are safe to fly  music michael barbaroNatalie  thank you very much natalie kitroeffThank you  Michael The Federal Aviation Administration certified the 737 Max 8 in 2017  and a key question now is the role that Boeing employees played in the certification process The F A A  has long relied on outside experts known as designees to help approve new aircraft  and in 2005  it established a program through which plane makers like Boeing could choose their own employees to act on the agency s behalf in helping to certify new models The program is meant to allow the F A A  to focus its limited resources on the most crucial work  but critics have questioned whether it essentially allows plane makers to serve as their own regulators Mr  Garneau said the Canadian government would also examine any alterations that Boeing made to the planes  software regardless of F A A  certification  as is the normal procedure Just the suggestion that Canada has doubts about the F A A  s certification of the planes is a significant change from last week  When Mr  Garneau announced that he was banning the Max series aircraft from Canadian skies on Wednesday  he also praised the professionalism of the F A A  With respect to safety  we are very comfortable with the fact that they are the certifying agency   he said at a news conference By mutual agreement  Canada and the United States have accepted the other s certifications for its planes  The F A A  has been something that Canada would follow to a considerable degree   said Karl Moore  a business professor at McGill University in Montreal who closely follows the aviation industry   So I would view this as a considerable shift  While Mr  Garneau did not offer any specific reason for his department s review  Professor Moore said it might be linked to questions around Boeing s relationship with the F A A  as well as concerns about the certification of the Max series The F A A  and Boeing have been adamant for the last week that the certification process is working well  and neither has suggested that any changes are planned  After the crash in Ethiopia  the F A A  said its  aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs  
Gail Collins  Bret  as always we ve got a lot to talk about  The mass shooting in New Zealand  of course  But perhaps we can get started with something less painful  Everybody s been talking about that college admissions scandal  What s your take Bret Stephens  We definitely should get to talking about the terrorism in Christchurch  not only in its own right  as terrible as that is  but because we know it could easily have happened here  even if  in this instance  it took place thousands of miles away As for the admissions scandal  where to start  With the kids  I guess  who clearly didn t deserve the parents to whom they were born and will be socially and emotionally scarred by this fiasco for many years  And even more so with the kids whose names we ll never know and who were denied admission because beneficiaries of the cheating had taken their place at these schools Gail  As a matter of justice  I totally agree  I m just not sure how much practical difference it makes where you wind up in college  This comes partly from our colleague Frank Bruni s book on the subject  and partly from the fact that I went to a school that was  at the time  pretty mediocre  It worked out fine  so maybe I m biased But let s get back to the justice part Bret  At the next level there are the scammers themselves  starting with William Singer  who ran the business fake charity that perpetrated the fraud  and everyone he enlisted to participate in it  including the athletic coaches and fraudulent test takers and so on  In some ways  they re the least interesting part of the story  because their motive was money and their method was fraud  Even so  I m still a little stunned by the thought of the fraudulent test takers who may be smart enough to ace an SAT for someone else but not smart enough to know that cheating is wrong  It s another reminder that there is no correlation between a high IQ and a basic moral sense Gail  The idea of the students not realizing their parents were gaming the system for them does fall apart when you ve got somebody else taking your SATs for you  Bret  Well  I suspect there are ways of gaming that  too  but we ll have to learn more About the parents  I have three kids and I totally get how natural it is to want the best for them   to put opportunities before them  develop their interests and do what you can to help and comfort them when they stumble  But a major part of raising children is setting an example for ethical behavior  And teaching them to accept that disappointment is not just an inevitable part of life but also  if you learn from it  a salutary part of it  And underlining that anything gained through cheating is not gained at all Finally  I guess  there s the meta lesson here about what this says about the way we live now and our social values  I m reluctant to draw too large a moral from a scam in which only a tiny fraction of people participated  But there s no doubt we ve become a society that increasingly has a hard time distinguishing between the substance of a serious university education and the supposed benefits of a prestigious brand  All I can say is that my mom never went to college and she s a heck of a lot wiser and savvier than I am Gail  And you know  Bret  you never can tell how these things are going to work out  As I said  I went to a Catholic school that was  back in the day  not on a top rung  It was the kind of place where the girls had curfews  everybody had to take theology classes and we were forbidden to invite a poet   Allen Ginsberg  in this particular case   to give a reading because he had an immoral outlook   I suspect the gay thing was a big factor  Bret  Starving  hysterical  naked  Go on Gail  Anyhow  the place was so rigid it propelled me into a rebellion   lots of demonstrations for free speech and a boycotting of our ethics of journalism class  I could go on  But the bottom line was I had a wonderful time  made friends for life and developed a sense of confidence I never would have felt if I d been surrounded by supercool high achievers and a sympathetic administration Wouldn t necessarily recommend that for everybody  but I do think there are a lot of kids who would bloom much faster in a nonelite academic institution Bret  Totally agree  One of the problems with elite universities is that they accustom students to a sense of prestige that s both superficial and inhibits a certain kind of risk taking and genuine nonconformity  Obviously that s not universally true but it is hard to move off the beaten path when the one before you seems well lit and glittering  It s also a truism that failure is life s great teacher  and whatever else the beneficiaries of the cheating may get  they are being deprived of something ultimately more valuable The larger question is whether this scandal exposes how rotten the entire enterprise of higher education has become  I personally think the four year college model is crazy   it should be three years  as it is in England  And that s just for starters  We need to reinvent the model root to branch  That s one of the reasons I m against making college available to all  You are merely funneling more students into a system of increasingly dubious value Gail  Kids who can t afford to go to college and who would benefit from college should get government funding  But the loan system is a different question  It s worrisome  I ve always wondered if high school graduates should have to work a year or two   volunteer programs count   before they can commit to an expensive education Bret  Agree completely  Frankly every 18 year old at any level of income would benefit from a year of service of some sort  I know I would have  and I d love to see my children take a gap year or two before college Gail  Our current government loan program is terrible  It helps schools grow by building up unnecessary programs and of course encourages kids to take out huge debt they ll be dragging around for half their lives  The for profit schools are the most egregious offenders  Many of them rake in a ton of money by making promises they can t deliver on   great high paying jobs that never materialize  I m not sure students should even be able to get federal loans for for profit schools  What do you think Bret  I don t share your profound skepticism regarding for profit schools  but I think you re right on this point  The federal government should not be indirectly subsidizing for profit entities  period  especially when they have a questionable track record of achieving the results they promise  Then again  I m skeptical of federal student loans in general  because I think they help drive up the cost of tuition  exacerbating the problem they re intended to solve But let s turn to the appalling attack in New Zealand  One thing that struck me is that  as soon as it was learned that the killer owned his firearms legally  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said   Our gun laws will change   I only wish we had that kind of common sense here in the U S Gail  The death toll in New Zealand is now up to 50  Less than two years ago we lost 58 people in a mass shooting in Las Vegas  Do you remember what our president said about gun laws then  He said   We re not going to talk about that today  We won t talk about that  Our only options are to just moan   I live in a crazy country   and let it go  or to soldier on  So let s give a cheer for the Americans who devote their lives to struggling for better gun regulation I know you re a supporter  Any thoughts about how we could push the cause forward Bret  You know I have my doubts about piecemeal  state by state gun regulation because strong gun laws in  say  Illinois won t matter much if someone can easily purchase a weapon in nearby Indiana  That s why I ve been banging a drum to repeal the Second Amendment  That amendment was written when a competent soldier could fire his weapon perhaps once or twice a minute  Today s mass killers are using weapons that allow them to kill dozens of people in the same amount of time  and that s not even with a fully automatic weapon Gail  This is where I express full agreement without any hope whatsoever  This is a country that hasn t been able to pass a constitutional amendment saying women are equal to men Bret  It is staggering that we ve come to accept as normal the mass murder of scores of people in places like Squirrel Hill  Orlando  Las Vegas  Sandy Hook  Sutherland Springs  Aurora and Parkland simply because unhinged men  acting from whatever motive  have access to these weapons  We should have an annual day of national mourning for victims of gun violence  Perhaps on the anniversary of Columbine Gail  I like that idea Bret  This seems to me a more fruitful avenue of political action than another long conversation about hate  Of course we need to be on our guard against every manifestation of white nationalism  just as we are when it comes to jihadism and every other form of violent extremism  But the issue now is that one evil person can kill dozens of innocent people on any given day  and we are almost powerless to stop him Gail  What we need is so simple   strong background checks on gun purchases  a ban on rapid fire weapons that make it easy to mow down dozens of people  But I wonder sometimes if we could up the ante  Require that everybody who buys a gun has to be able to demonstrate both an understanding of gun safety and a minimal level of marksmanship  The one thing we don t talk about is how inept many gun owners are  You need a decent amount of skill to be able to hit a target  particularly if you re nervous or on the move  Unless  of course  your target is a mass of people at prayer Bret  And while we are at it  a psychiatric evaluation  I d rather allow guns to people who can think straight  even if they don t shoot straight Gail  Before we go  any predictions on what happens next in Washington  It doesn t seems like there s much chance they ll override the president s veto of that bill aimed at keeping him from declaring a wall emergency Bret  None  And it is particularly disappointing to see a Republican like Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska  a so called constitutional conservative  vote with the president just weeks after he delivered a statement denouncing the national emergency declaration  It means that Republicans have no higher principle than their own political self preservation So now it will be up to the Supreme Court to act to defend the separation of powers  Don t be surprised if Chief Justice John Roberts or another conservative justice delivers the majority opinion against the president  along with the court s liberal wing  As we both know  the Trump presidency
