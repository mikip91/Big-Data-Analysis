WASHINGTON NEW YORK   U S  investigators sought warrants to read Michael Cohen s emails in July 2017  nine months before the FBI raided the home and office of President Donald Trump s former personal lawyer  according to documents made public on Tuesday The requests were made six months into Trump s presidency  Emails were sought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller s office as well as by the FBI  dating back as far as June 2015  according to the documents  Mueller is investigating Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election and possible coordination with Trump campaign members The nearly 900 pages of documents released by a federal judge in New York provide more detailed accounts of Cohen s financial relationships than previously known Cohen had been Trump s personal lawyer and self described fixer for more than a decade  but began cooperating with federal investigators soon after the April 2018 raids on his home  office and hotel room He later pleaded guilty in separate prosecutions to lying to Congress  bank fraud and campaign finance violations  The latter included paying hush money to silence two women who said they had sexual encounters with Trump Cohen is scheduled to begin a three year prison term on May 6  Trump has denied having had sexual relationships with the two women  Stormy Daniels  the porn actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  and former Playboy model Karen McDougal Much of the discussion about campaign finance issues in the released documents was redacted They were released after U S  District Judge William Pauley on Monday ordered prosecutors to make redacted versions public  in response to requests by news media organizations Lanny Davis  a lawyer for Cohen  said in a statement on Monday night that the document release  only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organisation to law enforcement and Congress  Since pleading guilty  Cohen has publicly turned on Trump  telling the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Feb  27 that his former boss was a  racist    con man  and  cheat  In his congressional testimony  Cohen said he was  ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty  of the things I did for Mr  Trump in an effort to protect and promote him  Cohen began working for Trump in 2007  The Republican president in December called his former lawyer  a rat  and in January said Cohen was  lying to reduce his jail time  Moscow has denied meddling in the 2016 election  though U S  intelligence agencies have concluded that it interfered to help Trump win Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia  and described the Mueller probe as a political witch hunt The newly released documents showed how the FBI made extensive use of its access to Cohen s Apple iCloud account  which allowed him to coordinate his work across such devices as an iPhone  iPad Mini and laptop FBI agents said they located a hotel room in New York s Loews Regency Hotel where Cohen was staying by using a device known as a Triggerfish that mimics cell phone towers to find a specific device The bank fraud case stemmed from Cohen dealings unrelated to Trump  and suggest that his financial situation was dire According to the documents  Cohen was in default by December 2017 on more than  20 million    15 million  in loans backed by New York taxicab medallions he owned The FBI believed Cohen misrepresented his finances to banks he owed money to According to the documents  Cohen concealed fees being paid to Essential Consultants  a firm he controlled  for political consulting  including from international clients with issues pending before the Trump administration  Among the payments Cohen was believed to have received was  600 000 from AT T Inc for consulting about  political issues  including net neutrality  the merger between AT T and Time Warner and tax reform  Another  583 333 came from an investment firm controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg  the documents showed Republicans in Congress have criticized Cohen s consulting work  arguing he should have made his contracts public through disclosures  The warrant does not appear to detail any violations to lobbying disclosure laws Cohen also used Essential Consultants to pay hush money to Daniels   Reporting by Ginger Gibson  Anthony Lin  David Morgan and Andy Sullivan in Washington and Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel in New York  editing by Jonathan Oatis  Will Dunham and Grant McCool

Many high achievers  particularly women and people of color  suffer from impostor syndrome  the fear that they don t belong in the rarefied realm to which they ve ascended and that they will soon be found out  Even Michelle Obama  who is  according to a Gallup poll conducted last year  the most admired woman in America  has said that she feels it   I share that with you because we all have doubts in our abilities  about our power and what that power is   she told students in London in December Well  maybe not all of us  I ve just finished Vicky Ward s  Kushner  Inc    a scintillating investigation of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump s White House sojourn  which comes out on Tuesday  It s full of damning details  contempt for the entitled  venal couple may be the one thing that unites all of D C  s warring factions  Still  the first daughter and her husband remain psychologically mysterious  at least to me  Why don t they have impostor syndrome  given that their total lack of qualifications for the jobs they are doing makes them actual impostors According to  Kushner  Inc    Gary Cohn  former director of the National Economic Council  has told people that Ivanka Trump thinks she could someday be president   Her father s reign in Washington  D C   is  she believes  the beginning of a great American dynasty   writes Ward  Kushner  whose pre White House experience included owning a boutique newspaper and helming a catastrophically ill timed real estate deal  has arrogated to himself substantial parts of American foreign policy  According to Ward  shortly after Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of state  Kushner told him  to leave Mexico to him because he d have Nafta wrapped up by October   As political actors  the couple are living exemplars of the Dunning Kruger effect  a psychological phenomenon which leads incompetent people to overestimate their ability because they can t grasp how much they don t know  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Partly  the Jared and Ivanka story is about the  reality distortion field    a term one of Ward s sources uses about Kushner   created by great family wealth  She quotes a member of Trump s legal team saying that the two  have no idea how normal people perceive  understand  intuit   Privilege  in them  has been raised to the level of near sociopathy Ward  the author of two previous books about the worlds of high finance and real estate  has known Kushner slightly for a long time  she told me that when he bought The New York Observer newspaper in 2006  he tried to hire her  She knocks down the idea that either he or his wife is a stabilizing force or moral compass in the Trump administration  Multiple White House sources told her they think it was Kushner who ordered the closing of White House visitor logs in April 2017  because he  didn t want his frenetic networking exposed   Ward reports that Cohn was stunned by their blasé reaction to Trump s defense of the white nationalist marchers in Charlottesville  Va    He was upset that they were not sufficiently upset  Still  even if you assume that the couple are amoral climbers  their behavior still doesn t quite make sense  Ward writes that Ivanka s chief concern is her personal brand  but that brand has been trashed  The book cites an October 2017 survey measuring consumer approval of more than 1 600 brands  Ivanka s fashion line was in the bottom 10  A leading real estate developer tells Ward that Kushner  now caught up in multiple state and federal investigations  has become radioactive   No one will want to do business with him    Kushner resigned as C E O  of Kushner Companies in 2017  but has kept most of his stake in the business  To truly make sense of their motivations  Ward told me  you have to understand the gravitational pull of their fathers  Husband and wife are both  really extraordinarily orientated and identified through their respective fathers in a way that most fully formed adults are not   she said Among the most interesting parts of  Kushner  Inc    are the chapters about the business history of Charles Kushner  Jared s felonious father  and his plan to restore his reputation  with Jared s help  after getting out of prison in 2006  Part of that rehabilitation project was the purchase of a flagship building in Manhattan   666 Fifth Avenue  an absurdly on the nose address   for which the family paid a record amount at the very height of the real estate market in 2007  When the Great Recession hit  the building became a white elephant  its debt threatening the family fortune Ward s book suggests that the search for someone who would bail out 666 Fifth Avenue has played a significant role in American foreign policy during the Trump administration  And since the completion of her book  we ve learned that Trump overrode intelligence officials  who were concerned about Kushner and his family s ties to foreign investors  to give Kushner a security clearance More from Opinion on Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump Opinion   The Editorial Board  Questions For and About Jared KushnerMarch 6

Contrary to the views of most economists  the Trump administration expects the U S  economy to keep booming over the next decade on the strength of further tax cuts  reduced regulation and improvements to the nation s infrastructure The annual report from President Donald Trump s Council of Economic Advisers forecasts that the economy will expand a brisk 3 2 percent this year and a still healthy 2 8 percent a decade from now  That is much faster than the Federal Reserve s long run forecast of 1 9 percent annual economic growth The administration s forecast hinges on an expectation that it will manage to implement further tax cuts  incentives for infrastructure improvements  new labor policies and scaled back regulations   programs that are unlikely to gain favor with the Democratic led House that would need to approve most of them Kevin Hassett  chairman of the White House council  insisted that the president s economic agenda would provide enough fuel to drive robust growth at a time when the majority of economists foresee a slowdown due in part to the aging U S  population He said the biggest risk to growth would be if financial markets anticipate that Trump s existing policies would be reversed  Without getting into specifics  Hassett said the risk would be if markets expect that the winner of the 2020 presidential election would shift away from policies such as the tax overhaul that Trump signed into law in 2017  Uncertainty over the policies themselves could slow their positive impact   Hassett said The tax cuts added roughly  1 5 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade  not accounting for economic growth  The report suggests that the lower tax rates have increased business investment in ways that will make the economy more productive  while also creating a surge in people coming off the sidelines to search for work The administration s optimism comes amid signs of slowing global economic growth  as well as a recent slowdown in manufacturing production and weakness in retail sales in January and December 
COEBURN  Va    Former coal miner John Robinson s bills for black lung treatments run  4 000 a month  but the federal fund he depends on to help cover them is being drained of money because of inaction by Congress and the Trump administration Amid the turmoil of the government shutdown this winter  a tax on coal that helps pay for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was cut sharply Jan  1 and never restored  potentially saving coal operators hundreds of millions of dollars a year With cash trickling into the fund at less than half its usual rate  budget officials estimate that by the middle of 2020 there won t be enough money to fully cover the fund s benefit payments As a surge of black lung disease scars miners  lungs at younger ages than ever  Robinson worries not only about cuts to his benefits  but that younger miners won t get any coverage  Coal miners sort of been put on the back burner  thrown to the side   Robinson said recently  sitting at his kitchen table in the small Virginia town of Coeburn  near the Kentucky border   They just ain t being done right  President Donald Trump  who vowed to save the coal industry during the 2016 campaign  has repeatedly praised miners  At an August rally in West Virginia filled with miners in hard hats  he called them  great people  Brave people  I don t know how the hell you do that  You guys have a lot of courage  Trump made no mention of restoring the 2018 tax rate in his proposed budget released in mid March The White House said in a statement Tuesday that  President Trump and this administration have always supported the mining industry by prioritizing deregulation and less Washington interference  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  whose home state of Kentucky is third in the nation in coal production  told a reporter from Ohio Valley ReSource in October the tax rate would  be taken care of before we get into an expiration situation  That didn t happen  McConnell spokesman Robert Steurer didn t repeat that pledge this week  rather  he wrote in an email   benefits provided through the Black Lung Disability Fund continue to be provided at regular levels  and that McConnell  continues to prioritize maintaining and protecting the benefits  Trump and McConnell have reaped large contributions from the coal industry  according to the political money website Open Secrets Trump received more than  276 000 during the 2016 presidential election from political action committees and individuals affiliated with coal companies  His inaugural committee received  1 million from Joe Craft  CEO of Alliance Resource Partners in Tulsa  Oklahoma  and  300 000 from the Murray Energy Corporation  the nation s largest privately owned coal mining company McConnell received more than  297 000 in coal industry donations since 2014  when he was last up for election Congress established the trust fund in 1978  Until the rate expired  money came from an excise tax of  1 10 per ton on underground coal and 55 cents on surface mined coal that brought in  450 million last year  Rates fell to about 50 cents and 25 cents when lawmakers failed to act on its Dec  31 expiration date The fund provides health benefits and payments to about 25 000 retired miners  Most worked for companies that are now bankrupt  Many  including Robinson  struggle to breathe as their lungs are slowly stifled by tiny dust and particles trapped there Robinson was 47 when he was diagnosed  part of a wave of younger miners that doctors and experts say have been swept up in a new black lung epidemic in Appalachia  Robinson  now 53  and others who depend on the fund are disappointed in McConnell and other leaders who typically enjoy miners  support  I just feel that Mitch McConnell has let the citizens of Kentucky down  especially the miners   said Patty Amburgey  whose husband  Crawford  died of black lung disease at age 62 in 2007  She draws a monthly widow s payment through his black lung disability benefits   And now there s an epidemic of black lung  Dr  Brandon Crum has watched that epidemic unfold at his Pikeville  Kentucky  radiology clinic  In less than four years  Crum has seen 200 miners diagnosed with a severe form of black lung disease  called pulmonary massive fibrosis  The nation had 31 such diagnoses in the 1990s  according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  We re looking at men in their 30s and 40s on oxygen  being evaluated for lung transplants   Crum said   Those are usually middle age individuals with younger families  so it affects their wives  a lot  His findings were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a December 2016 report that showed a shockingly high level of severe black lung cases at his clinic Amburgey  of Letcher County  Kentucky  said there will be fewer benefits for the growing number of younger miners with black lung if the fund is depleted  Robinson said he s now worried the trust fund s  pot of money will dry up  West Virginia Sen  Joe Manchin and other coal state Democratic senators are pushing a bill to shore up the fund by restoring the larger tax for 10 years  Manchin said in a statement that lawmakers  cannot continue to allow these solutions to be put off again and again   That bill is in a Senate finance committee The mining industry supported the increased tax rate s expiration  calling the effort to maintain it an unnecessary tax increase  The National Mining Association  which speaks for the industry  says the lower rate  will be sufficient to cover monthly benefit costs for the fund   The group argued extending the rate would lead to job losses The May 2018 GAO report contradicts that claim  saying the fund s beneficiaries could multiply  due to the increased occurrence of black lung disease and its most severe form  progressive massive fibrosis  particularly among Appalachian coal miners  The increase in younger black lung sufferers will put more pressure on the fund  as the industry continues to shrink  I think people always thought they would get  black lung  if they worked long enough in the mines  but I think it s a disease they thought would affect them at the end of their life  in their 70s or 80s   Crum said Amburgey says Trump reneged on his pledge to support miners  Mr  Trump promised that he would bring the mines back and take care of the miners  and that is not happening   she said   He promised us a snowball in July     
WASHINGTON   Top U S  trade and economic officials will visit China late next week for another round of negotiations  a White House official said Tuesday Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will lead the delegation  Trump administration officials said  The sources spoke on background because they weren t authorized to comment publicly The scheduled talks suggest the two sides believe they can make at least some progress  President Trump said Thursday at the White House that   Talks with China are going very well  But the negotiations are also taking place in late March  a period when administration officials had previously hoped to sign an agreement at Mar a Lago  the president s Florida resort  Business lobbyists say an agreement now probably won t be reached until late April  I would say perhaps the month of April   Larry Kudlow  the top White House economic adviser  said on C Span Friday   It s not in cement  The trade dispute began last year after the U S  listed a number of complaints  including that China engaged in outright theft of U S  trade secrets and forced companies to transfer technology in exchange for access to its market  Trump imposed tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese imports  about half what the United States buys from that country  China retaliated with tariffs on about  110 billion of U S  items Administration officials say they speak with their Chinese counterparts on a nearly daily basis  Business lobbyists say that a key sticking point is what type of enforcement mechanism will be included in the agreement  The Trump administration  they say  wants to have the option to impose tariffs on Chinese goods if China doesn t abide by the terms of the pact  The U S  also wants China to promise not to retaliate against those tariffs Still  business groups say the talks are making progress  We are cautiously optimistic that the two sides are going to get there   said Jeremie Waterman  president of the U S  Chamber China Center   They re clearly whittling the number of outstanding issues down  A report released Friday estimated that the trade war will likely damage the U S  economy  Analysts at the Rhodium Group  in conjunction with the U S  Chamber of Commerce  estimated that the tariffs  if they remained in place  could cost the United States a cumulative  1 trillion in economic output over the next decade Even if the tariffs are soon lifted  the report estimates that they will shave  50 billion  or 0 3 percent  off this year s economic output The duties would also not bring back production of information technology hardware to the United States  the report found    AP Writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report 
KUWAIT CITY   The United States  attempts to isolate Iran  including by punishing Iraqi militias and politicians who are supported by Iranian officials  has deepened tensions not only between Washington and Baghdad but also within the Trump administration American military and intelligence officials said the increasing pressure on Iraq risks infuriating its Parliament  including politicians linked to Iran  which could limit the movements of the 5 200 United States troops based in Iraq Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  whose confrontational stand on Iran has already strained ties with European allies  is leading the push for Iraq to confront its fellow Shiite majority neighbor  He arrived in the Middle East on Tuesday to speak with officials in Kuwait  Israel and Lebanon about containing Iran Under plans recommended by Mr  Pompeo and some White House officials  the State Department would designate Iran s military Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization  It would be a first instance of the United States designating a unit of another government s military as a terrorist group  American officials said it could put United States troops and intelligence officers at risk of similar actions by foreign governments The plans also would designate some Iraqi Shiite militias as foreign terrorist organizations  As a result  the Iranian trained militias   and Iraqi officials who support them   would be subject to new economic sanctions and travel restrictions The proposal was described to The New York Times on condition of anonymity by a half dozen American and Iraqi officials and experts familiar with the sensitive diplomatic plans but not authorized to discuss them by name Mr  Pompeo confirmed Monday night that he was looking at various groups  including the Revolutionary Guards in Iran  after he was asked by The Times on the flight to Kuwait about the proposed designations  There may well be other organizations that we designate   he said  The State Department designated an Iraqi group as a terrorist organization this month  despite opposition from the Pentagon The Iraqi militias   some of which were trained by the Revolutionary Guards   operate with Baghdad s approval or financial support  Several are legitimate players in Iraqi politics  They are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces  an umbrella organization of about 50 paramilitary groups that fought against the Islamic State  a radical Sunni group  and are paid by the Shiite dominated Iraqi government  The Americans can make the decisions they want  but what the Americans see is different than what we see   Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said last week   Our position on the Popular Mobilization Forces is very clear and well known  Officials at the Pentagon and the C I A    which Mr  Pompeo ran in the Trump administration s first year   oppose designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guards or the Iraqi militias as terrorist groups  fearing a backlash that could constrain American troops  Qassim Suleimani  commander of the corps  elite Quds Force and a regular visitor to Iraq  has been designated a terrorist by the United States ImageMike Pompeo  the secretary of state  has told Iraqi leaders they must stop buying Iranian natural gas  a major energy source for power starved Iraq CreditWin Mcnamee Getty ImagesIraqi leaders were already irate over the Trump administration s insistence that they comply with American sanctions imposed against Iran after President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Tehran Tensions between Washington and Baghdad have only risen through the winter In February  Iraqi politicians bristled after Mr  Trump said American troops in Iraq would monitor and pressure Iran  Iraqi leaders are resisting demands by Mr  Pompeo to stop buying energy from Iran   another issue on which Pentagon officials have sided with Baghdad  Iraq officials also remain unhappy by the closing of the United States Consulate in Basra  the country s second largest city  where a temporary halt of electricity exports from Iran led to violent rioting last summer On Friday  a senior State Department official said Mr  Pompeo s visit to the Middle East this week was part of the goal of rolling back Iran s forces and linked Shiite militias  As with Iraq  the pressure campaign has angered leaders in Lebanon  where Iran backed Hezbollah is a major military force  holds parliamentary seats and runs the health ministry Analysts said Mr  Pompeo s trip and its focus on Iran is an attempt to lend Trump administration support to embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel before national elections set for April 9  Iran and Israel are longtime enemies  Mr  Pompeo has denied such intentions Mr  Pompeo has told the leaders of power starved Iraq that they must stop buying Iranian natural gas and electricity  But on Tuesday  following recommendations by senior Pentagon officials  he agreed to extend a waiver of the sanctions to allow Iraq to buy electricity from Iran  The new waiver will expire in 90 days  in the middle of Iraq s scorching summer If they are forced to stop buying electricity from Iran  Iraqi officials warned  protests could destabilize the government of Mr  Abdul Mahdi  who was named prime minister in October  In February  he said Iraq would not comply with the sanctions  citing the 13 years of United Nations sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein that took a bruising toll on Iraqis throughout the country Iraqi officials now are exploring how to buy natural gas from Iran but still protect Iraqi banks from American penalties This month  against the advice of officials at the Pentagon  the State Department announced that it was designating an Iraqi militia  Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba  and its leader  Akram Abbas al Kaabi  as  specially designated global terrorists   The group is funded by the Iraqi government  but the State Department said its loyalty was to Iran Mr  Pompeo also is seeking to designate a more significant group  Asa ib Ahl al Haq  as a terrorist organization  Asa ib Ahl al Haq won 15 seats in Iraq s Parliament last year  Though its officials now say they tolerate the United States military presence in Iraq  the militia fought American troops at the height of the Iraq war  The militia is led by Qais al Khazali  a former American detainee who is accused of masterminding an ambush in the holy Shiite city of Karbala that killed five American soldiers in 2007 After Mr  Trump announced in December that he would withdraw United States forces from the fight against the Islamic State in Syria  American officials began quietly negotiating with Iraqi counterparts to shift hundreds of commandos and support troops to Iraq  The initial urgency for the shift has cooled  however  now that Mr  Trump has agreed to leave 400 American troops in Syria rather than withdraw all 2 000  But many Iraqi lawmakers are reluctant to give the 5 200 American troops already in Baghdad and at a handful of other bases much freedom to move or operate The terrorist designations could complicate talks over those issues and a range of diplomatic matters by fueling animosity toward the United States  One senior American official said the designations could lead to barring members of the Iraqi and Iranian governments from traveling to the United States   including to the United Nations in New York Administration lawyers have been poring over the proposed language for the terrorist designations and their possible consequences  So far  that has kept Mr  Pompeo from issuing them  two senior American officials said  One official said that trying to enforce the sanctions that the terrorist designations would prompt would be a nightmare

In recent decades  the sleek  wide eyed vaquita porpoise has been pushed to the brink of extinction by poachers pursuing another critically endangered sea creature  the totoaba  a fish whose swim bladder sells on the Chinese black market for thousands of dollars  The porpoises end up caught in nets intended for the totoaba and killed as collateral damage  The vaquita  its name is Spanish for  little cow   is a toothed whale and the smallest of all cetaceans  a full grown female can measure just five feet and weigh only 75 pounds  Thousands of vaquitas once plowed the Sea of Cortez  also known as the Gulf of California  which is bordered on the east by the Mexican mainland and on the west by the Baja California peninsula  Today  their numbers are estimated at around 10 but no more than 22 in the wild  Without a strictly enforced ban on even possessing gillnets  the species will soon go extinct in the wild  Just last week  the badly decomposed body of what was thought to be a vaquita was found caught in a gillnet There is little time left to act to save the vaquita  yet there is hope  For Mexico s new president  Andrés Manuel López Obrador  the fate of the little porpoise represents political opportunity and the chance of failure  He can do nothing and preside over the first sea mammal extinction in North America in decades  Or he can save one of Mexico s national symbols and rescue a troubled fishing industry   This is doable even now   said Brooke Bessesen  a conservationist and author of a new book   Vaquita  Science Politics and Crime in the Sea of Cortez    We have to come up with solutions that buy time  This is not a numbers game  It s a game of time  The Sea of Cortez is 62 000 square miles of azure and turquoise water that ranks as one of the most productive fisheries in the world  with more than 900 species of fin fish  including blue marlin and whale sharks  Commercial fishing started in earnest in the 1940s and is largely concentrated off the Mexican state of Sonora  on the eastern shore of the sea  But poachers are generally thought to be the problem these days The small scale fishermen who live on the sea s western and northern shores motor out in cheap fiberglass skiffs known as pangas  armed with gillnets  These nets  made from near invisible nylon mono  and multifilament  float on or near the surface and are weighted at the bottom  They kill indiscriminately  entangling everything from sea lion pups to great white sharks  Today  there are so many abandoned nets that the government pays fishermen to drag them ashore Poor poachers still use gillnets to catch the totoaba  whose swim bladder sells for  20 000 on average in China for traditional medicine and even as investments  A bladder is both a high end business gift and a sort of trophy in itself  The trade is so lucrative that the drug cartels have become involved in the poaching  Last April  Mexican authorities stopped a Chinese man at the Mexico City International Airport with 355 totoaba swim bladders  Three days later  another Chinese man bound for China had 417 swim bladders in two suitcases  And in December  Chinese officials confiscated 980 pounds of swim bladders  estimated to be worth  26 million  Sixteen people were arrested So it is no wonder that poachers and their gillnets have pushed the totoaba onto the list of critically endangered species maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature  and dragged the even more endangered vaquita along with it  The tiny porpoises drown when they are snagged in these nets The Mexican government shares some of the blame  Warnings that the vaquita might vanish arose years ago when there were still hundreds in the wild  but it failed to take effective actions to protect them  Mr  López Obrador s predecessor  Enrique Peña Nieto  banned the use of gill nets in the porpoise s habitat in 2015  for instance  but not their possession An attempt to capture porpoises to breed them in captivity in 2017 led to one dying  another nearly did and had to be released  The  totoaba  however  is being bred in captivity  giving the species a path to survival  But that effort is likely to be counterproductive for the vaquita  because it will only encourage more poaching of the totoaba The vaquita s situation is so dire that Thomas A  Jefferson  a San Diego marine biologist and conservationist  said he feared that extinction was its most likely fate   The conservationist in me doesn t want to admit that but the biologist has to   he said Yet the vaquita clings to life  In October  four were spotted in open water  The little porpoise may possess a unique genetic advantage that could allow it to recover in the wild if just left alone  The vaquita was never widely distributed  numbering perhaps only 5 000 at its modern height and located only in the Sea of Cortez  But there is no evidence that it has hit the bottleneck of birth defects from inbreeding often seen in declining populations And so  there is hope   if President López Obrador acts swiftly  The vaquita is one of Mexico s national animals  along with the golden eagle and the jaguar  He s under economic pressure to do so  But by acting aggressively to save the porpoise  he can also fulfill core campaign promises and emerge a hero  not just in Mexico but around the world   Pressure is coming from the United States  Last year  the United States Court of International Trade in New York temporarily banned seafood imports from Mexico caught in the Sea of Cortez with gillnets  The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by environmentalists complaining that the Trump administration was not enforcing a 1972 law that protects marine mammals from being killed in the process of fishing  It has been a crippling blow to the fishing industry in the Sea of Cortez  blocking an estimated 1 400 tons of seafood worth  300 million from being sold in the United States  Even before that  the grocery retailer Trader Joe s had banned blue shrimp from the Sea of Cortez from its nearly 500 stores because of concerns that vaquitas were being killed in gillnets intended for shrimp Even if he wasn t facing that economic pressure  saving the vaquita represents an opportunity for the new president  Mexican presidents cannot run for re election  so Mr  López Obrador is at the zenith of his power at the start of his six year term  By banning the possession of gillnets  Mr  López Obrador would slow the killing of both the totoaba and the vaquita and perhaps resolve the trade dispute with the United States  By expanding the practice of paying more fisherman to remove ghost nets  he would put idle anglers to work  By allowing video of illegal fishing to be used as evidence in court   it is now not admissible   the Mexican Navy could make poaching arrests stick  And by managing the fishery wisely  he would keep it producing for Mexicans and foreign markets alike  Already this kind of fishery management is taking shape in parts of Sonora  There has to be some way  But this comes down to López Obrador   said Ms  Bessesen  the author   He is the remaining flicker of hope for the vaquita  So  yes  there is hope  But in the Sea of Cortez  there is little time for either the president or the porpoise  Richard Parker is the author of  Lone Star Nation  How

BRUSSELS   European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen said on Tuesday that Washington s  selfish  approach to trade was not sustainable  but it was too early to say that EU U S  trade talks were doomed to fail The Trump administration has imposed stiff tariffs on U S  imports of steel and aluminium and set off a trade war with China in a bid to redress what it sees as unfavourable terms that contribute to a U S  trade deficit of over half a trillion dollars a year  The Commission  which negotiates trade agreements on behalf of the 28 nation European Union  has been in talks with U S  authorities since last July  seeking to clinch a deal on industrial goods trade EU governments are now discussing the details of a negotiating mandate for the Commission  while Washington has until mid May to decide whether to make good on President Donald Trump s threat to impose tariffs on imports of European cars  It is too early to say that our trade discussions are doomed to fail   Katainen told a regular news briefing  There are discussions going on on several levels and     we can end up having some sort of an agreement with the U S  on trade  but let s not go deeper than this   he said  adding that the scope of negotiations had to be clear and that a deal would require a lot of good will and political capital on both sides Asked about a reform of the World Trade Organization  WTO   Katainen said it was problematic and that attempts to get it done were like pushing a rope  Japan  China and the EU are willing to reform the WTO  the U S  has not been that interested  but they are willing to cooperate   he said  Even though the U S  authorities may think that selfishness is better than cooperation  it is not a sustainable way of thinking  We need better  rules based trade in the future where the international community sets the rules   he said U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress last week that the WTO was using an  out of date  playbook despite dramatic changes including the rise of China and the evolution of the internet He said Washington was nonetheless working  diligently  to negotiate new WTO rules to address these problems   Reporting By Jan Strupczewski  Editing by Kevin Liffey 
ROME   Russia and the United States remain split on how to resolve the crisis in Venezuela  officials from both powers said Tuesday after talks in Rome Elliott Abrams  the Trump administration s special envoy to Venezuela  met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov to discuss the situation in the Latin American country  We did not come to a meeting of the minds  but the talks were positive in the sense that I think both sides emerged with a better understanding of the other s views   Abrams told reporters after the meeting at a luxury hotel in Rome He said it s  perfectly plausible  that the two sides meet again but no date was set Russia backs Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and has accused Washington of meddling in the country s affairs by pressing him to step down and hand over power to opposition leader Juan Guaido Speaking to Russian media  Ryabkov emphasized the need for dialogue with the U S  but warned Washington against military intervention President Donald Trump has said  all options are on the table  regarding Venezuela  which Russia interprets as a refusal to exclude military force  Ryabkov said  We have warned the U S  against that reckless approach   Ryabkov said in remarks that were carried by the state Tass and RIA Novosti news agencies Abrams insisted the U S  will continue to keep its options open  but said it has chosen the path of putting political  financial and diplomatic pressure on Maduro s regime Earlier  Abrams met with government officials from Italy   one of four European Union countries that have not backed Guaido as Venezuela s interim president   and paid a visit to the Vatican  He noted that the Catholic Church enjoys respect and credibility in Venezuela  but said it s unclear what role if any the Vatican could play in its political crisis Pope Francis has reportedly written to Maduro indicating conditions aren t ripe for the Vatican to step in and help mediate Also Tuesday  the U S  added a Venezuelan state owned mining company to a growing sanctions list as it seeks to increase pressure on Maduro The new sanctions bar any U S  citizen or entity from any financial transactions with the gold mining company known as Minerven and its president  Adrian Antonio Perdomo Mata The U S  Treasury Department said the company is helping to prop up Maduro  who alleges that he is the target of a U S  coup plot    Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Ben Fox in Washington contributed to this report 
TIJUANA  Mexico SAN DIEGO   Three asylum seekers due to be returned to Mexico after appearing in U S  immigration court on Tuesday asked officials to let them stay in the United States because they feared for their safety while waiting out the process in Mexico The requests are a new approach by migrants in response to President Donald Trump s recent policy that requires people seeking protection in the United States to wait for their U S  court dates in Mexican border towns  part of his hard line stance to halt migration  Some 240 people   including families   have been returned to Mexico since late January under the program  dubbed Migrant Protection Protocols  MPP   according to U S  officials Six Central American migrants who crossed from Tijuana through the San Ysidro port of entry had their cases heard at a San Diego courthouse in the program s first day of hearings on Tuesday  All were told to return to Mexico  Robyn Barnard  a lawyer from the nonprofit group Human Rights First  said she asked officials to let her two Honduran clients stay in the United States  Both are afraid of returning to Tijuana to wait for their next hearings in early August  Tijuana  like much of Mexico s northern border zone  has seen extensive bloodshed since the federal government began using the military against drug cartels over a decade ago   Mexico is not a safe place for all people  and there are vulnerable groups at risk   Barnard told reporters after the hearing Her clients would remain at a U S  Port of Entry on Tuesday night  ahead of interviews with asylum officers  likely the next day  Barnard s assistant said  One client  19 year old Ariel  said he left Honduras because of gang threats and gave only his middle name because he feared reprisals  He was among the first group of asylum seekers sent back to Mexico on Jan  30 and given a notice to appear in U S  court in San Diego  God willing everything will move ahead and I will be able to prove that if I am sent back to Honduras  I ll be killed   he said prior to the hearing  Mariel Villarreal  an immigration lawyer with San Francisco based Pangea Legal Services  said she asked that her client from Guatemala be allowed to stay in the United States   They are just being sent back to homelessness in Tijuana   she said  adding that Mexican officials are not explaining how returnees can earn work permits U S  officials have said they are working with the Mexican government to ensure migrants are safe while they wait in Mexico  But some Mexican officials have warned the country s border cities would struggle to look after asylum seekers for long periods   GENEROUS  LAWSThe American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups are suing in federal court to halt the MPP program  which is part of a series of measures the Trump administration has taken to curb the flow of mostly Central American migrants trying to enter the United States The administration says most asylum claims  especially for Central Americans  are rejected  but because of immigration court backlogs people are often released and live in the United States for years waiting for their cases to be resolved The government has said the new program is aimed at ending  the exploitation of our generous immigration laws  Critics say the program violates U S  law and international norms because migrants are sent back to often dangerous towns in Mexico where it is difficult to keep track of their U S  court dates and to find legal help Gregory Chen  director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association  said there are real concerns about carrying out this major shift in U S  immigration policy  The government did not have its shoes tied when they introduced this program   he said Immigration advocates are watching how the proceedings will be carried out this week  especially after scheduling glitches created confusion around three hearings last week  according to a report in the San Diego Union Tribune The Executive Office for Immigration Review  EOIR   which runs U S  immigration courts under the Department of Justice  said only that it uses its regular court scheduling system for the MPP hearings and did not respond to a question about the reported scheduling problems   Reporting by Lizbeth Diaz in Tijuana and Jose Gallego Espina in San Diego  writing and additional reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York and Daina Beth Solomon in Mexico City  Editing by Bill Trott and Darren Schuettler

ERBIL  Iraq   American backed forces in northern Syria have captured a group suspected of organizing a bomb attack that killed four Americans and a number of allied Syrian militia fighters in January  a spokesman for the local forces said on Tuesday The spokesman  Mustafa Bali  wrote on Twitter that his group  the Syrian Democratic Forces  had used  technical surveillance  to find and arrest the suspects The bombing  on Jan  16  was the deadliest attack on Americans in Syria since Washington began a military campaign against the jihadists of the Islamic State in 2014  and it occurred in an area the United States had considered safe  Identifying those involved could help explain how the jihadists were able to strike far from their last stronghold The arrests were first reported by Reuters  A United States military official confirmed that Syrian allies had captured a small number of people linked to the attack in recent days but provided no further detail Col  Sean Ryan  a spokesman for the American led military coalition against the Islamic State  declined to comment further  citing in an email a continuing investigation In the attack  a suicide bomber entered a popular restaurant in the Syrian town of Manbij where American military personnel had stopped during a patrol to eat with their local Syrian allies The Americans killed were a military linguist who worked with the National Security Agency  a member of the Army Special Forces  a former Navy SEAL who did intelligence work for a Pentagon agency and an Arabic interpreter who worked for a private defense contractor At least 11 Syrians were also killed  most of them members of the Syrian Democratic Forces  a Kurdish led militia that has been working with the United States to fight the Islamic State Mr  Bali did not say how many suspects there were  or when or how they had been arrested The arrests come at a critical juncture for the future of the United States presence in eastern Syria President Trump has said that he wants to withdraw the roughly 2 000 American troops posted there  although that plan has been repeatedly revised  leaving American allies and even many United States officials confused about what Washington s policy is  Recently  the Trump administration has said that it is planning to leave 400 troops in Syria to continue working with American allies and to stop Iran and its allies from making inroads in the area It remains to be seen whether the American withdrawal will accelerate after the defeat of the Islamic State s last patch of territory  On Tuesday  officials from the Syrian Democratic Forces said the jihadists  territory had been reduced to a small patch of land along the Euphrates River near the village of Baghuz But the battle there has lasted much longer than predicted  and tens of thousands of fighters and civilians have surrendered as the jihadists  territory has dwindled  Most of the men are in prison and most of the women and children are in overcrowded refugee camps

SAN DIEGO   Several asylum seekers who are being forced to wait in Mexico while their cases wind through U S  immigration court told a judge Tuesday that they are afraid to return to Mexico as they await their next hearing   a development that introduces a new wrinkle to a major U S  policy shift The seven cases being heard in a downtown San Diego courtroom are among the first to advance under the Trump administration policy that calls for people seeking asylum in the U S  to be held in Mexico The initial appearances came three days before a federal judge in San Francisco is set to hear arguments by advocacy groups to halt the policy Attorney Robyn Barnard asked for access   at least by telephone   to any interviews conducted with her Honduran client with U S  officials about whether his fears of returning to Mexico are well founded Jason Aguilar  an attorney for U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  didn t object but deferred the request to other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection said it wouldn t comment due to pending litigation  and Citizenship and Immigration Services had no immediate comment The developments raised more questions about the administration s new approach to handling the claims of people who say they fear returning to their homelands because of danger related to race  religion  political beliefs  nationality or membership in particular social groups The administration hopes that making asylum seekers wait in Mexico will discourage weak claims and help reduce an immigration court backlog of more than 800 000 cases  Currently  families are typically released in the U S  with notices to appear in court and can stay until their cases are resolved  which can take years Critics say asylum seekers are forced to wait in unsafe environments and will struggle to find legal advice while in Mexico  Tijuana had more than 2 500 homicides last year The policy shift was introduced as families from Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador arrive at the U S  border to seek asylum Five of the seven people who were scheduled to appear Tuesday were represented by attorneys  Six were Honduran  one was Guatemalan Gerson Alonzo Beltrand of Honduras  who had Barnard speak on his behalf  expressed fear of returning to Tijuana  but the government attorney s response left unclear whether Homeland Security would grant his request  A judge scheduled an Aug  6 hearing on the merits of his asylum claim  Sir  we made significant progress in your case this afternoon   Rico Bartolomei  chief immigration judge in San Diego  told him The Associated Press witnessed one of the seven cases in the small courtroom before security guards cleared the aisles of an overflow crowd Lisa Knox  an attorney for two Honduran men  was in the courtroom and said three asylum seekers had expressed fear of returning to Mexico Knox said the judge continued her cases to early May to give her more time to prepare  One man failed to appear because he was in U S  custody in another part of the country The policy change  which followed months of high level talks with Mexico  has been introduced slowly with an average of 40 people a week being returned to Tijuana from San Diego in the first six weeks  Mexico agreed to accept up to 120 a week U S  officials began returning people to Mexicali  Mexico  from Calexico  California  last week and say they intend to sharply expand such activity across the entire border Mexicans and children traveling alone are exempt from the policy U S  and Mexican officials characterize the policy change as a unilateral move by the Trump administration  Mexico has said it will allow asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for humanitarian reasons    AP photographer Gregory Bull contributed from Tijuana  Mexico 
DEIR AL ZOR PROVINCE  Syria   U S  backed Syrian forces said they were close to defeating Islamic State in its final scrap of territory at Baghouz in eastern Syria after seizing an encampment from the jihadists on Tuesday  though the battle was not over yet Hardened militant fighters holed up in the encampment had been mounting a last stand defense of the Baghouz enclave  all that is left of Islamic State s self proclaimed  caliphate  that once spanned a third of both Syria and Iraq  This is not a victory announcement  but a significant progress in the fight against Daesh   said Mustafa Bali  a media official with the U S  backed Syrian Democratic Forces  SDF  on Twitter  using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State Bali said late on Tuesday clashes were ongoing and that fighters remain  in several pockets and their presence is not limited to a defined geography   The SDF captured hundreds of wounded militants when it overran the camp on Tuesday  Bali said  It also captured 157 mostly foreign fighters Footage obtained by Reuters showed dozens of people milling around the captured camp  preparing their belongings to leave in a convoy of trucks  None of those visible appeared to be armed  Men believed to be Islamic State fighters  women dressed in black robes and some children stood around the shabby camp area next to high rocks strewn with bits of tents and vehicles  A few of those visible used crutches or sticks to walk Footage from another part of the camp showed burnt out cars  dozens of abandoned vehicles  shattered buildings and tents made out of blankets  Asked by Reuters how long it would take to defeat the remaining jihadists  Bali said he expected the operation to end  very soon   adding that some remaining militants had fallen back to the bank of the nearby Euphrates River  The battles are not yet over   he said   Some of the terrorists have taken their children as human shields  There are intermittent clashes   GRAPHIC   How Islamic State lost Syria   https   tmsnrt rs 2O7l4mNMILESTONEIslamic State s fighters and followers have been steadily forced back to Baghouz after years of retreats in the face of military campaigns by an array of foreign and local forces The group s defeat at Baghouz will mark a milestone in the struggle against the jihadists  although adherents are still widely seen as a big security threat with a presence in remote territory and capable of mounting guerrilla attacks The capture of Baghouz will also mark a significant moment in the wider Syrian war  wiping out the foothold of one of the main combatants and leaving Syria partitioned between President Bashar al Assad  Kurdish led forces  and Turkey backed rebels Diehard jihadists have been mounting a desperate defense of the camp at Baghouz  deploying suicide bombers and car bombs Over the past two months  more than 60 000 people have poured out of the dwindling enclave  nearly half of whom surrendered as Islamic State supporters  including some 5 000 fighters  according to the SDF  Even facing defeat  Islamic State s propaganda machine still functions  An audio recording released overnight purported to carry a message from spokesman Abi al Hassan al Muhajer saying the group would stay strong and urged fresh attacks It has also put out a video from inside the Baghouz camp  showing bearded fighters among bullet pocked cars and lying on earth ramparts as they fired assault rifles  Against this scene  a man with a scarf wrapped around his head declaims a message of defiance   The crusaders have forced us from our homes and burned us  may God exact the same from them     O Muslim brothers everywhere  we have done our duty  Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of neighboring Iraq said images showed Islamic State had built tunnels in Baghouz big enough for vehicles   The advance is slow and the battle could take days to finish   he told a press conference in Baghdad RISK OF RESURGENCE The U S  military has warned that Islamic State may still count tens of thousands of fighters  dispersed throughout Iraq and Syria  with enough leaders and resources to present a menacing insurgency The Pentagon s own internal watchdog released a report last month saying Islamic State remained an active insurgent group and was regenerating functions and capabilities more quickly in Iraq than in Syria  Absent sustained  counterterrorism  pressure  ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to 12 months and regain limited territory   it said  using another acronym for the group U S  officials said U S  backed forces had captured fighters tied to a January suicide bombing at a cafe in Syria that killed four Americans  The attack in the city of Manbij was the worst single incident involving U S  personnel in Syria since they deployed on the ground there in 2015 It occurred nearly a month after President Donald Trump confounded his own national security team and allies with a surprise decision to withdraw all 2 000 U S  troops from Syria  declaring Islamic State had been defeated there  Washington has now partially reversed Trump s decision  planning to leave 200 peacekeepers in SDF held territory

JERUSALEM   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pays a visit to Israel this week but it s what he s not doing while there that may be the most notable aspect of the trip Pompeo doesn t plan to talk publicly about the  deal of the century  that President Donald Trump said he would offer to settle the Israel Palestinian conflict  a plan so important that he delegated negotiations to his senior adviser and son in law  Jared Kushner  Look  we desperately want a good solution   Pompeo told reporters Tuesday before his plane landed in Kuwait City for the first stop of the trip   Mr  Kushner s working on the Middle East peace plan  There ll be a right time when we will introduce bigger pieces of that  Pompeo s Israel itinerary is characteristic of the administration s approach to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  which has been largely private and without participation from the Palestinians The secretary won t even meet with any Palestinian officials on this trip  something that would have been routine for any top U S  diplomat in recent decades Pompeo s mere presence in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just weeks before a national election may be symbolic of the administration s political preference  but his main public message will be a familiar one  The U S  has an unbreakable commitment to Israel s security no matter who s in charge  I m going to Israel because of the important relationship we have   he said   Leaders will change in both countries over time  That relationship matters no matter who the leaders are  He said he would spend a good deal of time speaking about the security challenges posed by the conflict in Syria ahead of a sharp reduction in the U S  presence there  as well as about the longstanding threats Israel faces from Iran and the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah Palestinians wouldn t meet with Pompeo even if he wanted to see them  They have severed ties with the administration over its recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital  moving the U S  Embassy there from Tel Aviv and slashing hundreds of millions of dollars of aid  Political relations with the U S  administration are broken unless it backs down from its decisions on Jerusalem and refugees and abides by international law   said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas s spokesman Nabil Abu Rdeneh For now  the only apparent interaction between U S  and Palestinian officialdom seems to be an increasingly frequent stream of tweets from international negotiations envoy Jason Greenblatt  taking issue with Palestinian positions and criticism  most of which he says is incorrect  relies on faulty hearsay or is otherwise intended to deceive  The message is that those who spread misinformation about the conflict or the plan are not going to get away with it anymore   said Greenblatt  who is leading the talks with Kushner  in an interview last week   If you lie or deceive to try to shape public opinion  we re not going to let you do that without a response  We are in the midst of educating  and in some cases  re educating people  Greenblatt brushed away criticism of the tweets from former would be peacemakers and diplomats with experience in the region who say such engagement is undignified  In some cases it might be more useful to provide information behind closed doors  but they won t engage with us that way   he said   But more importantly  they are speaking loudly and publicly  so why should the U S  not say something publicly and respond to accusations  misinformation or manipulation  The peace plan itself doesn t yet exist  at least not outside a small circle of top White House aides led by Kushner and Greenblatt  They insist the plan is real but won t say when it will be presented other than after Israel s April 9 election  But officials note there is only a narrow window between the election  the start of the weeklong Jewish holiday of Passover in late April and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan  which starts in early May  That means the plan is likely to be delayed further In the meantime  Kushner and Greenblatt have begun to preview the nonpolitical elements of the plan to interested parties  including Israelis  Palestinians outside of the Palestinian Authority  Arab countries that will be critical to the economic part of the plan  and the Jewish and evangelical Christian communities in the U S  that staunchly back Israel Administration officials familiar with that outreach say each group has its own issues and concerns  They add that Greenblatt and Kushner have their work cut out for them as they try to promote a peace plan for which they are unwilling to provide details  particularly on the most sensitive parts of what must be in an eventual deal  the status of Jerusalem  Palestinian refugees  territorial sovereignty and borders Those officials  who were not authorized to speak publicly about the effort and spoke on condition of anonymity  conceded that early discussions had produced some unease  particularly as Greenblatt and Kushner make clear that both Israel and the Palestinians will have to make hard compromises to achieve peace Suggestions that the plan will not explicitly call for a two state solution  which is favored by most of the international community  and instead offer the Palestinians something less in return for massive economic investment have not sat well with veteran Mideast hands  The architects of Trump s deal of the century believe that s old think   said Martin Indyk  a former U S  ambassador to Israel and the second of the Obama administration s three Mideast peace envoys   Their idea is that the Palestinians can be persuaded to forgo their national aspirations in return for normalcy and prosperity funded by the Arab states

NEW YORK   A woman who climbed the base of the Statue of Liberty last July 4 to protest the separation of families at the Mexican border came to her sentencing Tuesday with her face entirely covered with clear sticky tape  irritating a judge who refused to proceed until she removed it After she did so  U S  Magistrate Judge Gabriel W  Gorenstein spared Therese Okoumou from prison for her conviction on multiple misdemeanor counts though he berated her for what he thought was a lack of concern for rescuers whose safety he said she jeopardized As she stood before him with a white headband across her forehead scrawled with the phrase  I care   he ordered her to perform 200 hours of community service and five years of probation  leading her attorney  Ron Kuby  to suggest the judge might be seeing a lot of them in the future  I think there s hope  otherwise  the judge responded  saying he would be willing to shorten the probation term at a later point if Okoumou did not commit more crimes Given a chance to speak in court  Okoumou called the case against her  a fraud against injustice   an explanation for her continuing protest and the tape she had earlier painfully pulled off her face  I m not a criminal   she told Gorenstein When Gorenstein took a break from the bench before announcing the sentence  Okoumou stood and turned around to face several dozen supporters before raising her fist in the air The gesture silenced the supporters  who raised their fists in return as everyone stood for a moment before Okoumou blew a kiss to them and turned around to await her sentence Outside court  she was surrounded by supporters as she railed the immigration policies of the Trump administration  saying they re what prompted the Statue of Liberty protest  We have people in cages  What was I supposed to do   she said   I made my point      Find your own conscience  Don t look up to me  The nearly four hour demonstration forced an evacuation of 4 330 people from the statue grounds on one of its busiest days of the year As he announced his sentence  Gorenstein noted that Okoumou repeatedly ignored orders to descend from a perch at the feet of the statue that was high enough that a prosecutor said it could have seriously injured or killed her or tourists below  New York Police Department rescuers were forced to climb a rickety ladder and gird themselves like mountain climbers to safely bring her down The judge said she tried to push down the ladder  jeopardizing rescuers Prosecutors noted in presentencing papers that since Okoumou s arrest  she has twice climbed the Eiffel Tower in Paris  France  forcing its evacuation  and has climbed onto the roof of an Austin  Texas  building  leading to another arrest in which charges are pending The Texas climb led to her being subjected to electronic monitoring in New York  though Gorenstein ordered the removal of the device Tuesday Kuby said Gorenstein was overestimating the danger to rescuers posed by his client s statue climb  The lawyer called them the most elite rescuers  on the planet  
WASHINGTON   A divided Supreme Court ruled Tuesday against a group of immigrants in a case about the government s power to detain them after they ve committed crimes but finished their sentences The issue in the case before the justices had to do with the detention of noncitizens who have committed a broad range of crimes that make them deportable  Immigration law tells the government it must arrest those people when they are released from custody and then hold them while an immigration court decides whether they should be deported But those affected by the law aren t always picked up immediately and are sometimes not detained until years later  In the case before the Supreme Court  a group of mostly green card holders argued that unless they re picked up essentially within a day of being released  they should be entitled to a hearing where they can argue that they aren t a danger to the community and are not likely to flee  If a judge were to agree  they would not have to remain in custody while their deportation case goes forward  That s the same hearing rule that applies to other noncitizens the government is trying to deport But the Supreme Court disagreed with the immigrants  interpretation of federal law in a 5 4 ruling that divided the court along ideological lines  Looking at a statutory provision enacted by Congress in 1996  Justice Samuel Alito wrote that  neither the statute s text nor its structure  supported the immigrants  argument  The court s conservative justices sided with the Trump administration  The administration argued  as the Obama administration did  that those affected by the law aren t entitled to a hearing where they can argue for their release  regardless of whether they are arrested immediately after being released from custody or not Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the administration was  pleased with the decision  Justice Stephen Breyer  in a dissent he read aloud in court  said that the larger importance of the case has to do with the power his colleagues  ruling gives the government  It is a power to detain persons who have committed a minor crime many years before  And it is a power to hold those persons  perhaps for many months  without any opportunity to obtain bail   Breyer said He wrote that in his view the law requires immigrants who have committed crimes to be detained  within a reasonable time after their release  from custody   presumptively no more than six months   If the person is not detained within that time  they should get a hearing where they can argue for their release  Breyer wrote The American Civil Liberties Union represented the immigrants in the case before the Supreme Court  ACLU attorney Cecillia Wang  who argued the case  said after the decision that the ACLU will call on Congress to clarify the law and will continue to pursue options in court Tuesday s ruling was based on the text of the statute  and Wang said the ACLU will argue that the statute  as interpreted by the justices  is unconstitutional  Wang also called the decision an  extreme waste of taxpayer money   saying it locks up individuals who are not a danger to the community The case before the justices involved a class action lawsuit brought by noncitizens in California and a similar class action lawsuit brought in the state of Washington  In those cases  the U S  Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided with the immigrants  but other appeals courts had sided with the government in similar cases One of the lead plaintiffs involved in the California case  Mony Preap  has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1981 and has two convictions for possession of marijuana  He was released from prison in 2006 but was not taken into immigration custody until 2013  Preap has since won his deportation case  allowing him to remain in the country The case is 16 1363 Nielsen v  Preap    
COLUMBIA  S C    Former Virginia Gov  Terry McAuliffe said Tuesday that he ll soon decide whether to join the sprawling field of candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination  I ve said clearly  in the next couple of weeks  I ll make the final determination   McAuliffe said during a visit to the Statehouse in South Carolina  home of the first Southern presidential primary of 2020   So  I m traveling around  but out of all those early states  I have a lot of strength here in South Carolina  McAuliffe  62  began popping up in early voting states late last year  campaigning with candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire as he explored a possible run for the White House  In January  the longtime Democratic power player used his old state political action committee to raise big money and cut checks to Democrats in both states  with campaign finance reports showing the PAC raised  300 000 in the second half of 2018 Part of the pitch McAuliffe said he s making to power brokers in early voting states is his ability to make Democratic inroads in Virginia  under Republican control for nearly two decades  In the 2017 elections  the last of McAuliffe s four year tenure as governor  15 House of Delegates seats shifted from Republican to Democratic control  reducing the GOP s majority to two seats  I took a red state and made it blue   the former Democratic National Committee chairman said   We had the biggest pickups in 140 years under my four years as governor  and if we did it there  we can do it here in South Carolina  Some have expressed concern that it could be difficult for McAuliffe to garner broad based popularity in the wake of the political crisis that engulfed three of Virginia s top Democrats  turning the state that has trended toward the left back into a potential battleground in the upcoming presidential race  Voters could take this out on Democrats     less as an ideological shift but more as an issue of repercussions for genuine political scandal   Josh Schwerin  who worked for McAuliffe  said earlier this year Last month  President Donald Trump gleefully agreed  predicting in a tweet that he will reclaim a state he lost by 5 percentage points to Hillary Clinton in 2016   Democrats at the top are killing the Great State of Virginia   he tweeted   If the three failing pols were Republicans  far stronger action would be taken  Virginia will come back HOME Republican  in 2020  Part of McAuliffe s calculus could be timed around an expected announcement from former Vice President Joe Biden  with whom many of McAuliffe s potential supporters may also fall politically in line  Like Biden  McAuliffe is largely seen as a centrist Democrat angling to tap into a network of supporters and donors cultivated over the last three decades during the Clinton and Obama administrations  During an event Monday at George Mason University in Virginia  McAuliffe said he believes Biden  is 95 percent  in the race   but he hasn t made a 100 percent decision to do it  As part of his trip to South Carolina  McAuliffe met with House members and planned to make a stop at Allen University  a historically black school in Columbia  Later Tuesday  he was expected to attend a reception at the home of longtime Democratic activists Don and Carol Fowler  Don Fowler chaired the DNC in the 1990s  His wife  Carol  headed the South Carolina Democratic Party in the 2000s  We re sort of getting the lay of the land  seeing old friends  firing folks up and seeing where we go   McAuliffe said    Associated Press writer Christina L  Myers contributed to this report

that it was canceling plans to build a major campus in Queens  the company did not directly blame any one person or group But others have Governor Cuomo  who with Mayor de Blasio helped negotiate the deal largely in private  blamed the State Senate  where crucial leaders opposed the plan Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  who opposed the campus  blamed Amazon for seeking  3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that she said should have been spent elsewhere Now a poll is offering insight into how the public feels about the deal s collapse  Over a third of New Yorkers point the finger at Ms  Ocasio Cortez  according to a Siena College Research Institute survey of 700 voters Here s what else you need to know about the poll  which was released yesterday The deal was popular across the state  Two thirds of voters said Amazon s withdrawal was bad for New York Sixty three percent of Democrats and 56 percent of self identified liberals said the cancellation was bad for New York Sixty four percent of New York City voters agreed with them Blame fell on Ms  Ocasio Cortez  Thirty eight percent of voters faulted the congresswoman for the deal s demise  identifying her as a  villain    Local activists in Queens  were labeled villains by 34 percent of voters In the New York City suburbs  50 percent of voters blamed Ms  Ocasio Cortez  Upstate  the number was 40 percent  in the five boroughs  it was 29 percent A spokesman for Ms  Ocasio Cortez declined to comment on the poll results What about the governor and mayor  Mr  Cuomo and Mr  de Blasio were each seen as a villain by fewer than 30 percent of voters What about Amazon  The company was blamed by 26 percent of voters The takeaways   The progressive base that cheered Ms  Ocasio Cortez as she railed against the deal was not representative of most voters  Those closest to a project don t necessarily reflect the views of a wider audience   said Steven Greenberg  a pollster with Siena College   I asked Mr  Greenberg if by  closest  he meant physical proximity  and he replied   Yes      Local activists in Queens  were blamed more often for the plan s demise than the State Senate was  In the suburbs  39 percent of voters labeled the activists as villains  but only 23 percent labeled the Senate as such This matters in part because Democrats need to retain suburban seats to hold on to their Senate majority The

should be seen separately  really in a way   is unclear at the moment  The case is more than 60 years old  but some at Cardozo say it shouldn t be forgotten  Today at 4 p m   the law school will

After more than a week of near silence  Dennis A  Muilenburg  the chief executive of Boeing  made his first substantive public comments about the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 In a statement released by Boeing on Monday night  Mr  Muilenburg expressed remorse for the deaths of 346 people in two strikingly similar air disasters involving the company s 737 Max jets   the accident in Ethiopia  on March 10  and the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia in October  Our hearts are heavy  and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board   Mr  Muilenburg said The investigations into the causes of both crashes are still in progress  and no conclusions have been reached by the authorities  But preliminary data suggests that a combination of new software  faulty sensor readings and inadequate pilot training may have been to blame French air accident investigators confirmed on Monday that flight recorder data from the Ethiopian Airlines jet showed  clear similarities  with the Lion Air jet The B E A   the French agency that investigates aviation crashes and incidents  said in a statement that the investigation team had noted these similarities  during the verification process  of data from the flight recorder  which keeps information like altitude and speed Mr  Muilenburg said Boeing was  taking actions to fully ensure the safety of the 737 Max   based on the information the company got from the investigations Among those actions is a software update that has been in the works for months  in response to the Lion Air crash  He said the update was due  soon  Mr  Muilenburg had been conspicuously quiet since the latest crash  as regulators around the world grounded Boeing jets and the company s stock slumped 12 percent He did make time to call President Trump twice   first on Tuesday of last week to press the president to keep the 737 Max jets flying  and a day later to encourage their grounding But on Monday night  Mr  Muilenburg for the first time appeared to try to reassure the public   Safety is at the core of who we are at Boeing  and ensuring safe and reliable travel on our airplanes is an enduring value and our absolute commitment to everyone   he said   This overarching focus on safety spans and binds together our entire global aerospace industry and communities  After the crash in Indonesia  Boeing faced tough questions about the development of the 737 Max  and a flight control system known as MCAS in particular  which will get the promised software upgrade  Other questions are being raised about the company s training procedures  When the plane was introduced  Boeing believed that pilots who had flown an earlier model didn t need additional simulator training and regulators agreed Many experts believe MCAS played a role in that first crash  But the Max jets continued to fly  reflecting the confidence of Boeing  regulators and pilots that the planes were beyond reproach But Boeing was thrust into a crisis last week when another jet crashed in nearly identical circumstances  Boeing s newest jet  its best seller  is now grounded  airlines are demanding compensation  and there is no clear timetable for the return of the Max planes And in a development that could have far reaching implications  Canada s aviation regulator is reviewing its validation of the American certification of the 737 Max  Marc Garneau  the transport minister  told reporters on Monday  We may not change anything  but we think it s a good idea to review that at this time   Mr  Garneau said

was involved in two deadly accidents in five months michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  As Boeing developed a new line of passenger jets  it was determined to avoid costly training for pilots  Then  two of those jets crashed  It s Tuesday  March 19 natalie kitroeffThe global aerospace business is essentially a duopoly  There are two big companies  There s Boeing  which is American owned  and there s Airbus  a European rival michael barbaroNatalie Kitroeff is a business reporter at The Times natalie kitroeffThese two are always competing with each other  They are competing on every single aspect of an airplane  And they re often competing for the same customers  music natalie kitroeffSo in late 2010  archived recordingWe re not redesigning the A320  It s pretty damn good just the way it is  What we re doing is offering new  more fuel efficient engines on today s airplane natalie kitroeff  Airbus announces that it is offering a new  fuel efficient version of its best selling A320 plane archived recordingWell  an A320neo  natalie kitroeffIt s going to be the A320neo archived recordingIt s a new engine option offered on today s A320 family of aircraft  And now they re being offered with new  more fuel efficient engines  We re putting our money on re engining the world s best selling single aisle aircraft natalie kitroeffThis amounts to essentially a frontal assault for Boeing  Fuel savings mean that airlines are saving on costs  And if Airbus is going to offer an option that is going to save airlines money  Boeing better will come up with its own alternative in order to compete in this cutthroat environment  where they have one main rival michael barbaroSo what does Boeing do in response to its biggest and most important rival coming up with this fuel efficient jetliner natalie kitroeffBoeing scrambles to respond quickly archived recording MUSIC  We are making a decision to invest in the 737 family natalie kitroeffAnd within months  the company comes up with an upgrade of its own archived recordingMax efficiency  which leads to profitability  max reliability  and to the flying public  max passenger appeal natalie kitroeffIt s going to be a fuel efficient version of their 737 workhorse  It is going to have bigger engines  And it s going to save airlines money on this fuel archived recordingThe best single aisle airplane in the world   MUSIC natalie kitroeffAnd they re going to call it the 737 Max  And one of the main goals of this engineering process is to keep this new plane as similar to its predecessor as possible michael barbaroWhy natalie kitroeffPart of the reason is that Boeing is competing with Airbus  And they re competing with them on every single cost item  And a plane is not just metal and technology  It s also what it costs to operate the aircraft and to train pilots to fly it michael barbaroHm natalie kitroeffIf the 737 Max turned out to be so different from its predecessor that it required training on a flight simulator  one of these giant machines where you have a cockpit and it mimics the experience of flying the plane  it would cost airlines tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft  It s incredibly expensive  So if Boeing were to say  we have this beautiful new jet  but it s going to require twice the amount of training that the Airbus model requires  the executives might pause on that  So as the company is manufacturing this plane  it wants to find ways to make it fly exactly the way that its predecessors did michael barbaroSo that there is not a need for training natalie kitroeffExactly  And there s a little bit of a problem  music natalie kitroeffThere is something that is fundamentally different about this plane  Its engines are bigger  and those engines need to be mounted farther forward on the wings  And that changes the aerodynamics of the plane  So the placement of those engines makes the nose of the plane push upward in certain circumstances  And that can lead to a stall  which is a dangerous situation  So Boeing has to come up with a solution to make the plane act the way its predecessor did and to counteract that force  So what it does is it comes up with this system  this software michael barbaroAnd what does the new system do natalie kitroeffThe new system automatically corrects for that upward motion of the nose  And it pushes the nose down automatically  And it s supposed to be working in the background  in a way that pilots don t even notice  correcting for an issue that was not in the prior model of this plane  And it s supposed to be something that is just keeping the pilot in a position where he or she feels as though the plane is flying in the same exact way under the same conditions that the prior model did michael barbaroSo Boeing thinks even though the engines are different  that they have developed a system that makes the engines operate essentially the same way the old 737 did  And from a pilot s point of view  therefore  there would be no need for new training natalie kitroeffYes  Boeing believed there was no need for extra training for pilots who had flown the previous model  And the Federal Aviation Administration agreed  In March 2017  the F A A  certified the plane  It did not require flight simulator training for pilots who had flown the prior model  And regulators around the world followed suit  Two months later  Boeing shipped out its first 737 Max out of Seattle  And the company decided that it does not need to fully inform pilots that this new software even exists michael barbaroHmm  So they don t even tell the pilots  They think it is so unimportant to the operation of the plane from the experience of a pilot that they don t even need to know natalie kitroeffYes  music michael barbaroSo what happens next  This plane is certified  on the market  What happens archived recordingWell  it s wheels up for Boeing s new 737 Max natalie kitroeffOrders come pouring in from across the globe archived recordingBoeing says the Max 8 is the company s fastest selling plane in its history  with nearly 4 700 orders for more than 100 customers across the world natalie kitroeffAnd carriers make this the best selling Boeing jet ever archived recording100 737 Maxes expected to be sold to AerCap  That s a lessor from the Netherlands  Also  Korean Airlines expected to order 30 of those natalie kitroeffPilots love it archived recordingIt flew beautifully  Its engines were extremely quiet natalie kitroeffIt is a hit archived recording 1Still  take a look at shares of Boeing  which  archived recording 2Are up  And up today natalie kitroeffThey re enjoying a ton of success in the stock market archived recording 14Logged orders or commitments for almost 400 aircraft  with a total sticker price of more than  37 billion natalie kitroeffInvestors love them  customers love them   until October 29  2018  when Lion Air Flight 610  a 737 Max carrying 189 people  takes off and  12 minutes later  crashes into the Java Sea archived recordingThree days after Lion Air Flight JT610 mysteriously disappeared before plummeting into the sea  there may be hope for answers michael barbaroWhat do we learn about what went wrong on that flight archived recordingMilitary personnel have found one of the black boxes natalie kitroeffSo a picture begins to emerge of this flight that suggests that the pilot may be fighting with that system archived recordingFlight data shows the on board computers were pushing the plane s nose down  Then the pilots aimed the nose higher  That happened 26 times  with the crew never following procedures to correct the problem natalie kitroeffSo while the software is pushing the nose down  the pilot is trying to push it back up over and over and over again  multiple times  That is the picture that begins to emerge  But we do not have full conclusive evidence yet michael barbaroSo it seems like the pilots on this flight are fighting a flight control system  a self correcting one that s supposed to keep the nose from going up  that they don t even know exists  right natalie kitroeffThat s exactly right  And what experts believe was happening was that this system was taking in a faulty sensor reading  So it was responding to bad data  And that is why it kept triggering over and over and over again  despite the pilot s best efforts to get the plane back on course michael barbaroAnd eventually those pilots lose their battle against the system natalie kitroeffEventually  the plane plunges into the sea  killing all 189 people on board  music michael barbaroWhat  Natalie  is the reaction among the airlines that have bought this line of planes to this emerging realization that Boeing hadn t revealed what turned out to be this important piece of information  the existence of this system that may likely have contributed to this crash natalie kitroeffPilots are furious   livid  in fact   that they have not been informed that this thing even exists  So they have these meetings  in which they told Boeing officials that this was a breach of trust and that it was disrespectful michael barbaroSo I have to assume that these angry pilots  in addition to just wanting to be sure everyone knows about this system  are demanding training so that they can properly respond to this system natalie kitroeffNo  they re not  The F A A   Boeing  nobody is recommending more training on this system michael barbaroWhy not natalie kitroeffThe American pilots that I ve talked to  they believe that because they ve been informed about the system  now that they know how it works  they are able to safely fly this plane  They know how to deal with this software if it becomes an issue on their flights  And they feel confident about flying the plane  This is a confidence that s  in part  based on statistics and experience  There has been only one fatality on U S  airlines in the last decade  Boeing has an enviable safety record  In many ways  they had good reason to be confident  And they re also promised a fix to the software that pushes the nose down  That s going to come within the next several weeks  They will be informed of it  And they feel confident that that is enough michael barbaroO K   so after this Lion Air crash  the only thing that changes is that Boeing vows to fix the system  But no additional training is ordered for any pilot anywhere  And the 737 Max planes are free to keep flying natalie kitroeffYes archived recording 1A jet has crashed  and the tragedy is being felt around the world archived recording 2U S  aviation investigators and a technical team from Boeing are headed to Ethiopia tonight  That s where a new 737 Max 8 jetliner crashed today  minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa archived recording 3Killing everyone on board  Flight 302 was en route to Nairobi  Kenya  when it crashed in the town of Bishoftu just six minutes after takeoff  The plane was carrying 149 passengers and 8 crew members natalie kitroeffImmediately  it becomes apparent that there are some similarities between this flight and the Lion Air crash archived recording 1Preliminary data shows a  quote   clear similarity  to the Lion Air Max 8 crash off Indonesia in October archived recording 2Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts archived recording 3What we now understand is what people had suspected  that there are certain similarities between the Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian crash earlier this month michael barbaroWhat are those similarities natalie kitroeffSo the pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported flight control problems  So that was a first clue  The plane is also moving in the same way that the Lion Air plane was  up and down  The speeds are changing rapidly  suggesting that the pilot may have been fighting with this system  again  with the pilot trying to pull the nose up  and the system pushing it down  Then there is physical evidence recovered at the site of the crash that seems to suggest that the nose was being pitched down  We don t know why  But again  it all points to this system being involved  potentially contributing to another tragedy michael barbaroAnd so what is the reaction this time  after the second crash of a 737 Max natalie kitroeffBoeing stands firm behind the plane  And American carriers are right there with them  But  archived recordingChina has grounded its entire Boeing 737 Max fleet natalie kitroeff  regulators around the world seem a little less confident  The Chinese and Indonesians quickly ground the 737 Max archived recordingMore countries following China s lead and grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet natalie kitroeffOnce the Europeans follow  archived recordingEuropean Aviation Safety Agency  they have banned flights of the 737 Max series  adding to similar groundings by China  Indonesia  Australia  Malaysia  the U K   Singapore  New Zealand  France  Germany  Italy  Ireland  Netherlands  Turkey  I could go on natalie kitroeff  American regulators are all of a sudden under immense pressure for the F A A  to ground these planes archived recording  donald trump Boeing is an incredible company  They are working very  very hard right now  And hopefully  they ll very quickly come up with the answer  But until they do  the planes are grounded michael barbaroAll of this looks very bad for Boeing  obviously  And it seems to stem from this original motivation  as you described it  to avoid classifying this new energy efficient plane that would compete against Airbuses as fundamentally different from older models of the 737 that would require expensive training of the pilots  even though a very crucial part of the plane was different natalie kitroeffThat s right  This motivation to keep this plane as similar as possible to its predecessor permeated the entire engineering process  Remember  this is how Boeing needs to compete with Airbus  It s also raising questions about the entire process for certifying aircraft in the United States  There is renewed scrutiny on the closeness between the F A A  and Boeing  The F A A  and Boeing work together to certify planes  The F A A  actually relies heavily on Boeing employees to help certify its aircraft michael barbaroAnd is that basically industry practice  Companies that make these planes work with the Federal Aviation Administration on the approval process natalie kitroeffThat s exactly right michael barbaroHmm natalie kitroeffI mean  folks were talking about this  right  But nobody was kind of raising red flags  I mean  it wasn t like people were up in arms about the way that this certification system works  But now there s been two crashes of the same model in less than five months  And we re hearing more and more from regulators and former regulators about how this close relationship may be too cozy michael barbaroNatalie  what do we know about the role that Boeing s employees played specifically in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max natalie kitroeffWe know that Boeing plays a critical role in helping to certify its aircraft  And we are learning more and more about the role that it played in the case of the 737 Max  The Seattle Times recently reported that not only was the F A A  relying heavily on Boeing in this case  but that Boeing itself was turning out an analysis that was downplaying the potential risks of a software system that is now at issue after these two crashes michael barbaroHmm natalie kitroeffThe F A A   like any federal agency  has a limited budget  And there s a reason why it would want to rely on the people who are most informed about the inner workings of increasingly complex aircraft in order to determine whether that plane is airworthy  You can see why you would need a relationship  and one where there is a lot of information sharing  right  Because the one side can t employ as many people as Boeing does  And the other side has a ton of expertise  But is that relationship too close michael barbaroRight  And there seems to be a lot of trust at the center of this system you re describing that allows Boeing to basically be like a co regulator of itself  And the most important trust involved here seems to be that a business will always put safety above profits  And I guess the question here is whether in a system with that much trust  that balance could get out of whack  and safety might lose out to profits  And the only way we would know that is when there s a tragedy or two tragedies natalie kitroeffBoeing doesn t want planes to crash  So their motivations are  in many ways  exactly aligned with their customers   But what s emerged after these two crashes   I mean  you heard the pilots  They said this was a breach of trust michael barbaroRight natalie kitroeffI think a lot of people are feeling that right now  that feeling of questioning of this process  And this isn t to say anything about Boeing s motivations  We are at the very beginning of investigating these two flights  and we do not want to rush to conclusions  But you re asking the questions that the people at the front line of this industry  the pilots  the crew  they re asking that right now  How do we regain trust in Boeing  And how do we know for sure that we are being told everything we need to know in order to fly these planes michael barbaroWe ve been talking about trust  the trust that the F A A  had in Boeing  that the airlines  their pilots and crews had or didn t have in this plane  But I m wondering now about the trust that we  as the flying public  have in these planes  And it s kind of hard to imagine wanting to fly on a 737 Max anytime soon  Let s say that the software gets fixed  And Boeing and the F A A   through their certification process  they all sign off on everything being safe  Why should we trust them after that  Why should we trust them  kind of  ever natalie kitroeffI think that coming up with the software fix is manageable for Boeing  an industrial juggernaut that has dealt with these issues before  And you ll remember  the 787 Dreamliner was grounded for three months in 2013  when it had battery fire problems michael barbaroAnd that was a Boeing plane natalie kitroeffRight  a Boeing plane  And we all fly on it  It s possible that people will be wary right now  But Boeing has the capacity to fix this thing and probably will  The bigger question is whether these two tragedies lead to a more wholesale transformation in the process for regulating the aircraft manufacturers in this country  What  if anything  is going to change in the process by which we determine  in the United States  that planes are safe to fly  music michael barbaroNatalie  thank you very much natalie kitroeffThank you  Michael The Federal Aviation Administration certified the 737 Max 8 in 2017  and a key question now is the role that Boeing employees played in the certification process The F A A  has long relied on outside experts known as designees to help approve new aircraft  and in 2005  it established a program through which plane makers like Boeing could choose their own employees to act on the agency s behalf in helping to certify new models The program is meant to allow the F A A  to focus its limited resources on the most crucial work  but critics have questioned whether it essentially allows plane makers to serve as their own regulators Mr  Garneau said the Canadian government would also examine any alterations that Boeing made to the planes  software regardless of F A A  certification  as is the normal procedure Just the suggestion that Canada has doubts about the F A A  s certification of the planes is a significant change from last week  When Mr  Garneau announced that he was banning the Max series aircraft from Canadian skies on Wednesday  he also praised the professionalism of the F A A  With respect to safety  we are very comfortable with the fact that they are the certifying agency   he said at a news conference By mutual agreement  Canada and the United States have accepted the other s certifications for its planes  The F A A  has been something that Canada would follow to a considerable degree   said Karl Moore  a business professor at McGill University in Montreal who closely follows the aviation industry   So I would view this as a considerable shift  While Mr  Garneau did not offer any specific reason for his department s review  Professor Moore said it might be linked to questions around Boeing s relationship with the F A A  as well as concerns about the certification of the Max series The F A A  and Boeing have been adamant for the last week that the certification process is working well  and neither has suggested that any changes are planned  After the crash in Ethiopia  the F A A  said its  aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs  
Gail Collins  Bret  as always we ve got a lot to talk about  The mass shooting in New Zealand  of course  But perhaps we can get started with something less painful  Everybody s been talking about that college admissions scandal  What s your take Bret Stephens  We definitely should get to talking about the terrorism in Christchurch  not only in its own right  as terrible as that is  but because we know it could easily have happened here  even if  in this instance  it took place thousands of miles away As for the admissions scandal  where to start  With the kids  I guess  who clearly didn t deserve the parents to whom they were born and will be socially and emotionally scarred by this fiasco for many years  And even more so with the kids whose names we ll never know and who were denied admission because beneficiaries of the cheating had taken their place at these schools Gail  As a matter of justice  I totally agree  I m just not sure how much practical difference it makes where you wind up in college  This comes partly from our colleague Frank Bruni s book on the subject  and partly from the fact that I went to a school that was  at the time  pretty mediocre  It worked out fine  so maybe I m biased But let s get back to the justice part Bret  At the next level there are the scammers themselves  starting with William Singer  who ran the business fake charity that perpetrated the fraud  and everyone he enlisted to participate in it  including the athletic coaches and fraudulent test takers and so on  In some ways  they re the least interesting part of the story  because their motive was money and their method was fraud  Even so  I m still a little stunned by the thought of the fraudulent test takers who may be smart enough to ace an SAT for someone else but not smart enough to know that cheating is wrong  It s another reminder that there is no correlation between a high IQ and a basic moral sense Gail  The idea of the students not realizing their parents were gaming the system for them does fall apart when you ve got somebody else taking your SATs for you  Bret  Well  I suspect there are ways of gaming that  too  but we ll have to learn more About the parents  I have three kids and I totally get how natural it is to want the best for them   to put opportunities before them  develop their interests and do what you can to help and comfort them when they stumble  But a major part of raising children is setting an example for ethical behavior  And teaching them to accept that disappointment is not just an inevitable part of life but also  if you learn from it  a salutary part of it  And underlining that anything gained through cheating is not gained at all Finally  I guess  there s the meta lesson here about what this says about the way we live now and our social values  I m reluctant to draw too large a moral from a scam in which only a tiny fraction of people participated  But there s no doubt we ve become a society that increasingly has a hard time distinguishing between the substance of a serious university education and the supposed benefits of a prestigious brand  All I can say is that my mom never went to college and she s a heck of a lot wiser and savvier than I am Gail  And you know  Bret  you never can tell how these things are going to work out  As I said  I went to a Catholic school that was  back in the day  not on a top rung  It was the kind of place where the girls had curfews  everybody had to take theology classes and we were forbidden to invite a poet   Allen Ginsberg  in this particular case   to give a reading because he had an immoral outlook   I suspect the gay thing was a big factor  Bret  Starving  hysterical  naked  Go on Gail  Anyhow  the place was so rigid it propelled me into a rebellion   lots of demonstrations for free speech and a boycotting of our ethics of journalism class  I could go on  But the bottom line was I had a wonderful time  made friends for life and developed a sense of confidence I never would have felt if I d been surrounded by supercool high achievers and a sympathetic administration Wouldn t necessarily recommend that for everybody  but I do think there are a lot of kids who would bloom much faster in a nonelite academic institution Bret  Totally agree  One of the problems with elite universities is that they accustom students to a sense of prestige that s both superficial and inhibits a certain kind of risk taking and genuine nonconformity  Obviously that s not universally true but it is hard to move off the beaten path when the one before you seems well lit and glittering  It s also a truism that failure is life s great teacher  and whatever else the beneficiaries of the cheating may get  they are being deprived of something ultimately more valuable The larger question is whether this scandal exposes how rotten the entire enterprise of higher education has become  I personally think the four year college model is crazy   it should be three years  as it is in England  And that s just for starters  We need to reinvent the model root to branch  That s one of the reasons I m against making college available to all  You are merely funneling more students into a system of increasingly dubious value Gail  Kids who can t afford to go to college and who would benefit from college should get government funding  But the loan system is a different question  It s worrisome  I ve always wondered if high school graduates should have to work a year or two   volunteer programs count   before they can commit to an expensive education Bret  Agree completely  Frankly every 18 year old at any level of income would benefit from a year of service of some sort  I know I would have  and I d love to see my children take a gap year or two before college Gail  Our current government loan program is terrible  It helps schools grow by building up unnecessary programs and of course encourages kids to take out huge debt they ll be dragging around for half their lives  The for profit schools are the most egregious offenders  Many of them rake in a ton of money by making promises they can t deliver on   great high paying jobs that never materialize  I m not sure students should even be able to get federal loans for for profit schools  What do you think Bret  I don t share your profound skepticism regarding for profit schools  but I think you re right on this point  The federal government should not be indirectly subsidizing for profit entities  period  especially when they have a questionable track record of achieving the results they promise  Then again  I m skeptical of federal student loans in general  because I think they help drive up the cost of tuition  exacerbating the problem they re intended to solve But let s turn to the appalling attack in New Zealand  One thing that struck me is that  as soon as it was learned that the killer owned his firearms legally  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said   Our gun laws will change   I only wish we had that kind of common sense here in the U S Gail  The death toll in New Zealand is now up to 50  Less than two years ago we lost 58 people in a mass shooting in Las Vegas  Do you remember what our president said about gun laws then  He said   We re not going to talk about that today  We won t talk about that  Our only options are to just moan   I live in a crazy country   and let it go  or to soldier on  So let s give a cheer for the Americans who devote their lives to struggling for better gun regulation I know you re a supporter  Any thoughts about how we could push the cause forward Bret  You know I have my doubts about piecemeal  state by state gun regulation because strong gun laws in  say  Illinois won t matter much if someone can easily purchase a weapon in nearby Indiana  That s why I ve been banging a drum to repeal the Second Amendment  That amendment was written when a competent soldier could fire his weapon perhaps once or twice a minute  Today s mass killers are using weapons that allow them to kill dozens of people in the same amount of time  and that s not even with a fully automatic weapon Gail  This is where I express full agreement without any hope whatsoever  This is a country that hasn t been able to pass a constitutional amendment saying women are equal to men Bret  It is staggering that we ve come to accept as normal the mass murder of scores of people in places like Squirrel Hill  Orlando  Las Vegas  Sandy Hook  Sutherland Springs  Aurora and Parkland simply because unhinged men  acting from whatever motive  have access to these weapons  We should have an annual day of national mourning for victims of gun violence  Perhaps on the anniversary of Columbine Gail  I like that idea Bret  This seems to me a more fruitful avenue of political action than another long conversation about hate  Of course we need to be on our guard against every manifestation of white nationalism  just as we are when it comes to jihadism and every other form of violent extremism  But the issue now is that one evil person can kill dozens of innocent people on any given day  and we are almost powerless to stop him Gail  What we need is so simple   strong background checks on gun purchases  a ban on rapid fire weapons that make it easy to mow down dozens of people  But I wonder sometimes if we could up the ante  Require that everybody who buys a gun has to be able to demonstrate both an understanding of gun safety and a minimal level of marksmanship  The one thing we don t talk about is how inept many gun owners are  You need a decent amount of skill to be able to hit a target  particularly if you re nervous or on the move  Unless  of course  your target is a mass of people at prayer Bret  And while we are at it  a psychiatric evaluation  I d rather allow guns to people who can think straight  even if they don t shoot straight Gail  Before we go  any predictions on what happens next in Washington  It doesn t seems like there s much chance they ll override the president s veto of that bill aimed at keeping him from declaring a wall emergency Bret  None  And it is particularly disappointing to see a Republican like Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska  a so called constitutional conservative  vote with the president just weeks after he delivered a statement denouncing the national emergency declaration  It means that Republicans have no higher principle than their own political self preservation So now it will be up to the Supreme Court to act to defend the separation of powers  Don t be surprised if Chief Justice John Roberts or another conservative justice delivers the majority opinion against the president  along with the court s liberal wing  As we both know  the Trump presidency makes for strange bedfellows The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here

OXON HILL  Md    President Trump said on Saturday that he planned to issue an executive order that would help guarantee free speech at colleges and universities by putting their federal aid at risk if they do not protect the viewpoints of students of all political stripes The president made the announcement during a rambling two hour speech to activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington  but he did not provide any details about the possible executive order  Several White House officials did not respond to emails or telephone calls seeking additional information The White House did not respond to questions about when the president might sign the order The issue of free speech on college campuses has for years been a cause célèbre among young conservative activists  who point to instances around the country in which conservative voices have been shunned by liberal students and professors The crowd  which included many college age conservatives  welcomed Mr  Trump s announcement  leaping to their feet when he pledged to hold school administrators accountable for ensuring that conservatives were permitted to express their views on campuses  often places where liberals outnumber them The president cited the case of Hayden Williams  a young activist who was beaten up last month as he was recruiting for a conservative organization at the University of California  Berkeley   long one of the leading centers of liberal academic thought  If they want our dollars  and we give it to them by the billions  they ve got to allow people like Hayden and many great young people  and old people  to speak   Mr  Trump said  drawing huge applause Mr  Trump invited Mr  Williams  who was in the audience  to address the crowd briefly  calling him strong and urging him to sue the university because of the episode  Mr  Williams thanked the president for supporting young conservatives such as himself Floyd Abrams  a leading First Amendment lawyer  expressed concern about the president s proposed executive order  The visage of the most congenitally anti free speech administration in American history making a series of decisions as to which campus conduct is pro  or anti free speech is more than alarming   Mr  Abrams said in an email Saturday afternoon The president has raised a similar threat before  implying he would withhold federal funds from Berkeley after it canceled a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos  a conservative speaker and professional provocateur Students at multiple campuses threatened to boycott events where Mr  Yiannopoulos was to speak  forcing them to cancel the appearances In 2017  at Claremont McKenna College  a private liberal arts school in Southern California  about 250 people blocked entrances to an auditorium where Heather Mac Donald  a conservative writer who has criticized the Black Lives Matter movement  was speaking That same year  students at Middlebury College in Vermont disrupted a speech by Charles Murray  a scholar known for his 1994 book   The Bell Curve   which links socioeconomic status with race and intelligence  Protesters chanted   racist  sexist  anti gay  Charles Murray  go away  It is unclear how Mr  Trump s executive order would change that dynamic  though he hinted that universities and colleges would have to do more to prevent such demonstrations or risk the loss of grant money that the institutions receive from the federal government to support research He said the executive order would  require colleges to support free speech if they want federal research  funding It is not clear how long the idea has been under consideration at the White House or whether the president decided to pursue an executive order because of the episode involving Mr  Williams  which Fox News and other conservative outlets covered extensively It is also unclear how much the president can withhold federal aid to colleges without congressional action  Previous discussions of that issue in conservative circles have focused on passing legislation to change the requirements for colleges to request grant funding from the federal government Mr  Trump made the announcement during one of the longest speeches he has ever delivered  speaking for more than two hours to the thousands of activists at the conclusion of the three day annual convention The campaign like speech touched on dozens of hot button issues  including illegal immigration  The president accused  open border  Democrats of letting murderers  rapists and drug dealers into the country  They give us some very bad people   people with big  long crime records   he said of Central American countries including Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador   Murderers  Killers  Drug dealers  Human traffickers  It s so sad to see how stupid we have been  More than two years after he took office  Mr  Trump once again insisted that his inaugural crowd was larger than his critics have admitted  He bragged about the state of the economy and denounced Democrats who he said supported socialism He denigrated the trade deals made by previous politicians and boasted about the tariffs that the United States had imposed on China and other countries  And he repeatedly mocked the  new green deal  offered by some Democrats  saying it would destroy the economy and take away people s cars and airplanes  Somebody described it as a high school term paper  written by a poor student   he joked 
MEXICO CITY   Mexican officials are carrying out the Trump administration s immigration agenda across wide stretches of the border  undercutting the Mexican government s promises to defend migrants and support their search for a better life The Mexican authorities are blocking groups of migrants at border towns  refusing to allow them onto international bridges to apply for asylum in the United States  intercepting unaccompanied minors before they can reach American soil  and helping to manage lists of asylum seekers on behalf of the American authorities to limit the number of people crossing the border Breaking with decades of asylum practice  the Mexican government has also allowed the Trump administration to send more than 120 men  women and children to Tijuana while they await decisions on their asylum applications in the United States  The program could be expanded to other border crossings as soon as next week Officials inside the administration of Mexico s new president  Andrés Manuel López Obrador  have called his stance on migrants a strategic decision not to anger President Trump He doesn t believe he can change Mr  Trump s mind  they contend  Furthermore  the officials say  Mr  López Obrador has not wanted to jeopardize other aspects of the deeply interconnected relationship between the two countries  ranging from elaborate regional trading arrangements to information sharing on border security  transnational crime and terrorism  So he has avoided a bruising and potentially costly public fight over the issue A lifelong defender of the poor  Mr  López Obrador often refers to his plans for Mexico as a grand transformation  placing his ambitions for the nation on par with those of its great leaders ImageAsylum seekers who have been waiting weeks for

everyman credentials by cutting government salaries  flying coach around the country and opening the opulent presidential palace to the public  He has also vastly reduced the number of Central American migrants Mexico deports from its soil But not everything has transformed Exhibit A is the Migrant Protection Protocols  the Trump administration s policy to require asylum seekers to remain on the Mexican side of the border while they await decisions on their fate  Rights groups contend that it dumps migrants in an increasingly violent Mexico and impairs their access to legal counsel and family support in the United States Mr  López Obrador s administration  which came into office saying it would not cooperate with Mr  Trump s anti immigration agenda  has gone along with it on several fronts  including accepting women and children despite earlier promises to take only adult male asylum seekers The Mexican government argued the policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico was imposed on them by the United States and they consented for humanitarian reasons It is also true that for Mr  López Obrador  giving in to some of Mr  Trump s border demands and rarely saying a word against the American president in his daily press briefings carries little political cost at home  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United

dangerous cities in Mexico CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesTo many Mexicans  the fate of migrants is secondary to domestic concerns about jobs  security and corruption  Mr  López Obrador retains an 80 percent approval rating  despite his government s willingness to take back migrants applying for asylum in the United States  If we have to accept a handful of people back into Mexico  that s not really a problem for us  not even politically   said one official who was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations   What we really want to avoid is a public fight with Trump  But in its effort to avoid a cross border fight  the Mexican government has chosen politics over its humanitarian ideals  critics contend  Mexico is continuing to play the role that the U S  thinks it should  which is to contain the migrant influx  period   said Melissa Vertiz Hernández  who coordinates the Working Group on Immigration Policy  a network of civil society and rights groups in Mexico The delicate balance with the United States has left the Mexican government without a clear  consistent immigration policy  so Mexican states and municipalities along the border are often in the position of fending for themselves under pressure from their American counterparts In the Mexican border city of Reynosa  for instance  almost no one is allowed to cross the bridge to apply for asylum in neighboring McAllen  Texas  They are typically blocked or apprehended by Mexican officials  forcing migrants to try their luck in other towns ImageAn orientation session for Mexican migrants

hundreds of migrants who arrived in a caravan in recent weeks and kept them under tight watch in a shelter with limited access to outsiders  advocates say  After a public outcry  the center was closed and many were bused to other cities and towns along the border The mayor of Ciudad Juárez  meanwhile  has threatened to sue a neighboring governor for shipping migrants to his town  It has become a game of political hot potato  with desperate Central Americans who are fleeing poverty and violence caught in the middle Elsewhere along the border  shelter officials say they manage lists of asylum applicants by name  nationality  age and documentation to assist Mexican officials who are complying with American border patrol mandates The Mexican government is resisting Mr  Trump in some ways  the official in Mr  López Obrador s government insisted  Even acquiescing to the Trump administration on the Migrant Protection Protocols was done strategically  according to the official and two others briefed on the plan By allowing the program to start in San Diego and Tijuana  the Mexican officials argued  legal challenges to it in the United States go to the federal courts in the Northern District of California  which are generally seen as liberal  This matters at a time when many Americans are focused on how to beat Mr  Trump in the 2020 elections  in particular by leveraging the Mexican American vote But many activists are far from confident that a legal challenge will put an end to the program  I think it s an incredibly risky move   said Stephanie Leutert  the director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin   I don t think you should put your country s foreign and migratory policy in the hands of a civil society organization in another country  ImageMen rest at a migrant shelter by the Rio Grande in Reynosa  Mexico  near the border crossing leading to McAllen  in the United States CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesOn Feb  14  that civil society organization  the American Civil Liberties Union  and several other advocacy groups filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration s policy  A decision on a temporary restraining order is expected in the coming days The lawsuit  filed on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were returned to Mexico in recent weeks  accuses the Trump administration of violating federal and international migration and human rights laws Advocates contend that by forcibly sending asylum seekers to Tijuana  the Trump administration has plunged them into an unfamiliar and dangerous environment where their lives may be in jeopardy Killings in Tijuana have skyrocketed in recent years because of a turf war in the local drug market  In 2018  the city posted its deadliest year on record  with more than 2 500 killings The Trump administration first announced the new policy in December  and on Jan  28 the head of Mexico s migration agency said the Mexican government had imposed restrictions on its enactment But Mexican officials have backed down from many of those initial restrictions  including its refusal to accept women with children  Trump administration officials have said they plan to expand the program to other ports of entry along the border  The López Obrador administration has said little publicly about the changes ImageMembers of the U S  Border Police patrol

the border by American officials  she broke down  I cried and cried   she recalled Mexican officials have said they cannot provide shelter and care for the returnees  essentially leaving them to a network of community groups in Tijuana and elsewhere in the state of Baja California But the shelter network has been under extraordinary pressure from the almost continual arrival of migrants traveling in caravans  who have pushed the centers beyond capacity Sister Salomé Limas  a social worker at the Instituto Madre Asunta migrant shelter in Tijuana  said it is currently housing about 120 women and children   in a space designed for 44 Among the migrants are several families who are seeking asylum in the United States and were returned in recent weeks under the Trump policy Sister Salomé said the shelter can house the families until their first court date in the United States  in late March  After that  she is not sure  What s going to happen to them   she said   We don t know

LOS ANGELES   Once again taking aim at President Trump  California on Monday filed its 47th lawsuit against the administration  this time to block a move that would effectively strip millions of federal dollars from reproductive health providers that perform abortions and abortion referrals Attorney General Xavier Becerra  who has become one of Mr  Trump s most aggressive critics  said Monday that the administration s changes to Title X  the federal family planning program  would punish doctors and clinics for giving women a comprehensive portrait of their reproductive options  The administration announced those changes last month  This is 2019  not 1920   Mr  Becerra said in an interview   Jeopardizing the health of women is not what we should be doing in the year 2019  On Monday  20 other states  plus Washington  D C   said they would file a separate lawsuit challenging the same restrictions Millions of low income patients receive reproductive health services each year through Title X  a  286 million federal family planning initiative  Programs that receive Title X funding provide a range of services  including family counseling  preventive health screenings for breast and cervical cancers  contraceptives  and treatment for sexually transmitted infections About 40 percent of the 4 000 clinics nationwide that receive Title X funding are operated by Planned Parenthood The lawsuit by California was filed on Monday just hours after the restrictions devised by the Trump administration were published in the Federal Register It was already against the law for health care providers to use federal funds for abortions  The new rule would prohibit organizations that provide referrals for abortions from accepting any federal funds for family planning  These rules were put in specifically to target Planned Parenthood   said Crystal Strait  the head of the organization s operations in California On a practical level  the administration s order would bar doctors from mentioning the option of an abortion in nearly all cases  Ms  Strait said  This builds a wall between a doctor and her patients   Ms  Strait said   We ve never in the United States accepted that  When you go into your physician  you expect to get medically accurate options  Clinics that receive federal funds can provide patients with a list of primary health care providers  including those that provide prenatal care  but cannot identify which ones on the list  if any  perform abortions The final rule also requires a complete separation of family planning and abortion services at clinics that offer both  Federal health officials estimate that 10 to 20 percent of Title X sites do not comply and would have to spend an average of  20 000 each to meet the requirement The new requirements would effectively redirect Planned Parenthood s  60 million in yearly funding to faith based and alternative providers unless its clinics dramatically changed the way they operate Anti abortion organizations applauded the administration s rule change Patrina Mosley  the director of Life  Culture and Women s Advocacy at the conservative Family Research Council  said clinics like Planned Parenthood s had been operating  against the very statute for which the money is intended  by providing referrals for abortions She said Monday s lawsuits were frustrating but not surprising   When the administration does something that the left doesn t like  they go to court   she said   This is the habitual pattern  The change  critics argue  threatens to leave women without a full understanding of their reproductive options Gov  Kate Brown of Oregon  a Democrat  criticized the new rule as  another attack from the Trump administration on women and families   Oregon is leading the coalition of states that plan to challenge the rule in a separate lawsuit on Tuesday California would be hit particularly hard by the administration s order  Mr  Becerra said  Of the four million women affected by the ruling nationwide  more than one million are in California  he said  Playing politics with that care is dangerous and grossly irresponsible   Gov  Gavin Newsom said in a statement   Our mothers  wives  sisters and daughters deserve better  
WASHINGTON   Intelligence officials who brief the president have warned him about Chinese espionage in bottom line business terms  They have used Black Sea shipping figures to demonstrate the effect of Russia s aggression in Ukraine  And they have filled the daily threat briefing with charts and graphs of economic data In an effort to accommodate President Trump  who has  attacked them publicly as  naïve  and in need of going  back to school   the nation s intelligence agencies have revamped their presentations to focus on subjects their No  1 customer wants to hear about   economics and trade Intelligence officers  steeped in how Mr  Trump views the world  now work to answer his repeated question  Who is winning  What the president wants to know  according to former officials  is what country is making more money or gaining a financial advantage While the professionals do not criticize Mr  Trump s focus  they do question whether those interests are crowding out intelligence on threats like terrorism and the maneuvers of traditional adversaries  developments with foreign militaries or geopolitical events with international implications  If Trump tailors it to his needs  that is fine and his prerogative   Douglas H  Wise  a career C I A  official and a former top deputy at the Defense Intelligence Agency  said of the daily briefing   However  if he suppresses intelligence through that tailoring  that is not helpful  He is no longer making informed decisions because he is making decisions based on information he could have had but didn t have  Presidents have long shaped their intelligence briefings based on their interests and the issues of the moment   be it a Cold War with the Soviet Union or Al Qaeda and terrorism  Other presidents have also told intelligence agencies to focus more on economics  After his election  President Bill Clinton told his briefers that he wanted more economic information  And during the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis  President Barack Obama had an economic intelligence briefing created to supplement the daily intelligence briefing Mr  Trump  finding traditional intelligence briefings less helpful than his predecessors  reduced the in person briefings to about twice a week  Those sessions from Dan Coats  the director of national intelligence  and Gina Haspel  the C I A  director  now feature far more charts and visual aids to appeal to Mr  Trump  according to a senior intelligence official  President Trump s economic focus has been evident  including his emphasis on increasing NATO allies  burden sharing and pressing allies and partners to do more in support of our common interests   said Garrett Marquis  a spokesman for the National Security Council The written reports are still delivered daily to John R  Bolton  the national security adviser  who conveys the highlights to Mr  Trump on days when the intelligence chiefs are not at the Oval Office  according to a former official The regular briefings have been a cornerstone of how intelligence officers inform the president since the days of President Harry S  Truman  President Obama and President George W  Bush also received such briefings daily For 73 years  geopolitical trends  warnings and high level gossip have been delivered to the White House regularly by the C I A  and other intelligence agencies in the form of what is today known as the President s Daily Brief  or P D B  Once a thick binder of reports  the P D B  is now presented on a secure tablet computer and produced six days a week by officials at the C I A  and other intelligence agencies ImageSteel pipes in Germany that will be used to construct a pipeline to transport Russian natural gas arriving from the Nord Stream 2  Mr  Trump has pressed his intelligence briefers on why Berlin is allowing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to proceed if Germany is truly worried about Moscow s aggression CreditSean Gallup Getty ImagesOn any given day  the briefers would describe terrorist threats in the Middle East  worry about the North Korean nuclear program or get the results of covert missions around the world Some of what bores Mr  Trump in traditional intelligence briefings  according to former officials  are the detailed analyses of the activities and motivations of secondary foreign officials  The president wants information about the leader of various countries  not the underlings But the president has also shown less interest in details about potential terrorist plots or cloak and dagger spy work   the kind of secret information that excites most officials  In his view  too little traditional intelligence analysis examines economics and trade as a fundamental driver of international conflict   Economic security at home goes hand in hand with national security abroad   said Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council So in security briefings  Mr  Trump peppers officials with questions about economic competition with China  including Beijing s efforts to gain technological superiority and to achieve trade advantages over the United States He has also shown a fascination with Angela Merkel  the German chancellor  repeatedly asking why she will not cut a deal with him on military spending despite his advisers  explanation that the German government s coalition agreement constrains Ms  Merkel s ability to increase defense funding  And he has pressed his intelligence briefers on why Berlin is allowing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Russia to go forward if Germany is truly worried about Moscow s aggression Mr  Trump has also repeatedly spoken to intelligence and military briefers about the cost of American bases overseas and the defense expenditures of allies in Europe and Asia  according to White House officials The president s push also has national security officials thinking about the economic angles of international flash points  When Russia seized Ukranian sailors and ships in the Sea of Azov  officials in Washington began studying the implications to shipping  White House officials argued that the Europeans would have the most leverage given their dominance of the industry  But they also argued that by raising the costs of shipping  the Russians were  shooting themselves in the foot   a senior administration official said Intelligence officials have always adapted their briefings to the needs and interests of the current president  But they have never faced a challenge like Mr  Trump  who by virtue of his background and experience  views the intelligence agencies with deep skepticism The president has publicly clashed with intelligence briefers over their assessments of the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea  He has also privately complained after national security briefings that   My generals don t understand business   according to a former administration official Senator Angus King  the Maine independent who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee  said Mr  Trump s criticism of his briefers could inflict real damage  It threatens to intimidate agencies into softening their analysis or not delivering information that the president needs to hear  he said  The problem   Mr  King said   is the message sent to agencies   Don t tell me information I don t want to hear   Mr  Trump s skepticism of traditional intelligence stretches back to his untraditional path to the presidency  his campaign and his early days in the White House ImageAmerican soldiers at Osan Air Base in South Korea  Mr  Trump has repeatedly spoken to intelligence and military briefers about the cost of American bases overseas CreditPool photo by Kim Hong JiTwo weeks before Mr  Trump took office  the top intelligence chiefs   including the heads of the F B I   the C I A  and the N S A    briefed Mr  Trump and his team at Trump Tower on the agencies  findings that Russia was behind the election meddling  The issue was a touchy matter  Mr  Trump saw any evidence that Russia helped get him elected as an attack on his legitimacy  After the briefing  the F B I  director at the time  James B  Comey  pulled Mr  Trump aside Mr  Comey told the president that the bureau was given a dossier that showed the Russians may have compromising information on him  The disclosure unnerved Mr  Trump and deepened his suspicions of the intelligence community Some former officials say Mr  Trump s view of the competence of the intelligence agencies has improved  largely because of the work of Ms  Haspel and her predecessor at the C I A   Mike Pompeo  now the secretary of state But as Mr  Trump s recent criticism of the intelligence chiefs on Twitter demonstrated  he is still frustrated  That is partially because many of his world views are strongly held  He has shown little willingness  over the long term  to alter those opinions The tension with the intelligence agencies is also a reflection of Mr  Trump s status as the ultimate outsider convinced that the Washington establishment s way of doing business is broken and flawed  He really doesn t have a lot of respect for the intellectual  professional class   said Walter Russell Mead  a fellow at the Hudson Institute   Intelligence agencies are bureaucracies  so what the president is getting is this kind of curated feed  The agencies attach a high value on how they do these things  But that is not Trump  While other presidents have frequently disagreed privately with their intelligence briefers  they did not challenge them publicly  said Michael Morell  a former top C I A  official who has briefed Presidents Clinton  Bush and Obama  Bush would say   Michael  I don t agree with what you are saying   then we would have a back and forth and we would discuss it   said Mr  Morell  who now hosts the  Intelligence Matters  podcast   Obama would say the same thing  But that discussion was substantive  It wasn t based on whether something is consistent with your worldview or the policy line you have taken  James R  Clapper Jr   President Obama s director of national intelligence  conducted twice weekly briefings for Mr  Obama  leaving the remaining daily sessions to others  Mr  Obama was a faithful reader of the P D B   so the briefings with intelligence officers did not cover the written material but instead offered supplementary material and updates Mr  Clapper said that when Mr  Trump became the Republican nominee and began receiving intelligence briefings  it was apparent that  a very different approach  would be needed because Mr  Trump was not a reader  So the briefers quickly adjusted to verbal presentations  stressing big points and wherever possible  graphics   Mr  Clapper said   That s not a negative comment since all presidents have their own style of absorbing information  Some former administration officials said Mr  Trump s focus on asking economic questions was just a different form of what his predecessors had done  It is not the president s job to adapt to the P D B    said David Priess  a former C I A  officer and briefer who wrote  The President s Book of Secrets    It is the job of intelligence officers to adapt the P D B  to the president  
This is the way the trade war ends  Not with a bang but with empty bombast According to multiple news organizations  the U S  and China are close to a deal that would effectively end trade hostilities  Under the reported deal  America would remove most of the tariffs it imposed last year  China  for its part  would end its retaliatory tariffs  make some changes to its investment and competition policies and direct state enterprises to buy specified amounts of U S  agricultural and energy products The Trump administration will  of course  trumpet the deal as a triumph  In reality  however  it s much ado about nothing much  As described  the deal would do little to address real complaints about Chinese policy  which mainly involve China s systematic expropriation of intellectual property  Nor would it do much to address Donald Trump s pet although misguided peeve  the imbalance in U S  China trade  Basically  Trump will have backed down If this is the story  it will repeat what we saw on the North American Free Trade Agreement  which Trump denounced as the  worst trade deal ever made   In the end  what Trump negotiated   the U S  Mexico Canada Agreement  or U S M C A    was very similar to the previous status quo  Trade experts I know  when not referring to it as the Village People agreement  call it  Nafta 0 8   fundamentally the same as Nafta  but a bit worse  Paul Krugman did explanatory journalism before it was cool  moving from a career as a world class economist to writing hard hitting opinion columns  For an even deeper look at what s on his mind  sign up for his weekly newsletter  Why is the president who famously declared that  trade wars are good  and easy to win  effectively waving the white flag  Mainly because winning turns out not to be easy  at all  Trump s beloved stock market hates talk of trade war  There is no broad constituency for protectionism   in fact  public opinion has become much more pro free trade under Trump  And Chinese retaliation has hit hard at voting blocs Trump depends on  especially in farm states Now  agreement with China isn t a done deal  Trump may also yet open another front in the trade war  against European automobiles  And the Village People agreement awaits congressional approval  and it s not clear what Trump will do if that isn t forthcoming Still  it looks possible  even likely  that within a few months most though not all of the trade war will have been unwound  So will it all look in retrospect like a passing storm  with few long term consequences No  it won t  Even if most of the tariffs go away  Trump s trade belligerence has done lasting damage to America s reputation  and hence to a global economy that depends on American leadership  The whole world now knows two things about us  First  we re not reliable   an agreement with the U S  is really just a suggestion  because you never know when the president will invent some excuse for breaking it  Second  we re easily rolled  The president may talk tough on trade  but in classic bully fashion  he runs away if confronted On U S  unreliability  consider the way the current administration has treated Canada  probably the friendliest neighbor and firmest ally any nation has ever had  Despite generations of good relations and a free trade agreement  Trump imposed large tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel  invoking national security as a justification  This was obviously specious   in fact  Trump himself basically conceded this point  justifying the tariffs instead as retaliation for Canadian dairy policy  which was also specious   The lesson for the world is that America can t be trusted  Why bother making deals with a country that s willing to slap sanctions on the best of allies  and clearly lie about the reasons  whenever it feels like it Meanwhile  the sudden retreat in the confrontation with China shows that we talk loud but carry a small stick  It would be one thing if the U S  had changed course on the merits  But backing down so easily  after all the posturing  tells the world that the way to deal with America is not to bargain in good faith  but simply to threaten the president s political base  and maybe offer some payoffs  political and otherwise   I m still wondering about those floors China s largest bank rents at Trump Tower  And when it comes to payoffs  autocracies have an advantage over nations that observe the rule of law  China appears to be getting most Trump tariffs removed  Canada still faces those steel tariffs Finally  by undermining the international system  America is making the world worse for itself as well as for everyone else  In fact  payback is coming right away  The World Trade Organization just gave America a big win in a dispute over Chinese agricultural subsidies   but its verdict is probably moot  because the Trump administration has spent the past two years denigrating the organization  and has crippled the appellate body that is supposed to enforce W T O  rulings  blocking the appointments that would have given this trade court the quorum it needs to act Let s be clear  Not having a trade war is better than the alternative  But the path the Trump administration has taken to its trade deals has made us less trusted  less respected and weaker than we were before  So much winning The Times is committed

A perjurer soon to be serving three years in prison had a great many charges to level against President Trump on Wednesday  Michael Cohen  once the president s personal lawyer  told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform of misbehavior and possibly criminal conduct on the part of his former client ranging from paying off mistresses and lying about a real estate deal in Moscow to inflating the value of his assets for insurance purposes and deflating them when paying his taxes  Yet Mr  Cohen testified that he had no evidence of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia and was never explicitly ordered by Mr  Trump to lie to Congress  Mr  Cohen had inferred  however  that Mr  Trump wanted him to lie  Mr  Cohen s lies under oath are one of the reasons he is headed to a federal prison For all the sensationalism and political excitement of Mr  Cohen s testimony  it is worth remembering that Mr  Trump has not  in fact  been found guilty of any crime  something that cannot be said about his former lawyer  Would any of the president s critics credit Mr  Cohen s veracity if he were testifying in support of his former employer  rather than against him  Whatever you think about Donald Trump  Michael Cohen simply is not an honest person  The idea that he suddenly becomes one as soon as he has something bad to say about the president is far fetched  to say the least High profile congressional hearings are show business  and this one was no exception  It bears comparison with the highly politicized hearings that a Republican controlled Congress held during the Obama administration  looking into such matters as arms sales to Mexican drug cartels as part of a botched sting strategy by the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms  Operation Fast and Furious  and conflicting State Department claims about the circumstances of the 2012 attack by Islamist militants on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi  Libya  The latter saw Republicans in 2015 call the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi  The political significance of the hearing was obvious But Benghazi and Fast and Furious were real policy scandals involving life or death matters  The Cohen hearing  by contrast  was little more than an opportunity for scattershot attacks on the president and his business dealings  It was hardly a focused investigation into Russian collusion  supposedly the central concern of the president s critics  It was seven hours of innuendo  speculation and largely unsupported allegations about wrongdoing and offensive behavior of whatever sort Mr  Cohen or his congressional interlocutors cared to bring up  Mr  Cohen had copies of checks that he had received to reimburse him for his payments to Stormy Daniels  buying her silence about her affairs with Mr  Trump  Sex  money and secrecy are titillating  but are the prosecutors of the Southern District of New York really going to be able to find a campaign finance crime here  Maybe they will make a case  Mr  Cohen s testimony certainly did not  The hearing was sleaze for the sake of pure partisan pleasure  not a serious attempt at uncovering lawbreaking There is scant possibility that anything Mr  Cohen said Wednesday will even be grounds for Democrats to attempt impeachment  Some in the party are eager to do to President Trump what Republicans did to Bill Clinton 20 years ago  But if impeaching a president for lying under oath about sex was partisan overreach then  impeaching President Trump now  when not even that much legal wrongdoing on his part has been proved  would be absurd  Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives seem to understand this Impeaching a president is a thoroughly partisan endeavor  as the only two impeachments that have gone to trial in the Senate  those of Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson  demonstrated  But up to now   high crimes and misdemeanors  has involved at least some basis in legal fact   President Clinton s perjury or President Johnson s defiance of the Tenure of Office Act  Mr  Cohen s claims about coded signals from President Trump indicating that he should lie to Congress fall short of the probative value of a stained blue dress More public hearings are to come  though Mr  Cohen s next appearance on Capitol Hill will be to testify for another session behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee  Republicans did a poor job getting to the heart of the Benghazi fiasco when they held the gavels before the 2016 election  But at least the G O P  was investigating a scandal related to policy  The Democrats  most high profile investigations are personal  They might say that is because President Trump is personally corrupt  On the other hand  while Democrats may find much to dislike about this president s policies  he has suffered no policy debacles like Benghazi or Fast and Furious  Unemployment is low  wages are rising  and the country is as close to peace as it ever has been since the  War on Terror  began  Whether or not there is proof of Russian collusion or crooked business dealings  the president s opponents may have to keep their focus on his personal affairs because in seeing to the nation s interests  he has been embarrassingly successful more Views on the cohen hearingOpinion   Peter Wehner  Republicans Sink Further Into

Say this for Donald Trump  He s provided us with many iconic quotations  which will surely be repeated in histories and textbooks for decades if not generations to come  Unfortunately  they ll be repeated because they are extremely clear examples of bad ideas In economics  the line you hear most is Trump s declaration that  trade wars are good  and easy to win   Coming in second is his assertion that  I am a Tariff Man   coupled with the claim that foreigners pay the tariffs he has been imposing Now  that last claim is something you can test  Over the course of 2018 Trump imposed tariffs on about 12 percent of total U S  imports  and many of those tariffs have been in effect long enough that we can get a first read on their consequences On Saturday economists from Columbia  Princeton  and the New York Federal Reserve released a paper   The impact of the 2018 trade war on U S  prices and welfare   that used detailed import data to assess the tariffs  impact   The paper  by the way  is a beautiful piece of work   The conclusion  to a first approximation  foreigners paid none of the bill  U S  companies and consumers paid all of it  And the losses to U S  consumers exceeded the revenue from the new tariffs  so the tariffs made America poorer overall How did they get this result  The U S  government collects data on the prices and quantities of many categories of imports  Many of these categories faced new tariffs  but many others didn t  So you can compare what happened to the tariffed imports to the de facto control group of untouched imports  this tells you the impact of the tariffs Under Trump s vision  in which foreigners would have paid the tariffs  what you would have expected to see is falling prices for tariffed goods  offsetting the tariff  so that consumer prices didn t change  What you actually see  however  is no visible effect of the tariffs on import prices  So foreign suppliers don t seem to have absorbed any of the tariffs  which were fully passed on to consumers  tariff inclusive prices  Figure 1  have risen by the full amounts of the tariffs ImageFigure 1CreditAmiti et al  2019 These price hikes led to substantial changes in behavior  Imports of the tariffed items fell sharply  partly because consumers turned to domestic products  but also in large part because importers shifted their sourcing to countries that aren t currently facing Trump tariffs  For example  a number of companies already seem to have begun buying goods they previously bought from China from Vietnam or Mexico instead These changes in behavior are the key to the paper s conclusion that the tariffs have made America poorer Consider the following example  pre tariff  the U S  imports some good from China that costs  100  Then the Trump administration imposes a 25  tariff  raising the price to consumers to  125  If we just keep importing that good from China  consumers lose  25 per unit purchased   but the government raises an extra  25 in taxes  leaving overall national income unchanged Suppose  however  that importers shift to a more expensive source that isn t subject to the tariff  suppose  for example  that they can buy the good from Vietnam for  115  Then consumers only lose  15   but there is no tariff revenue  so that  15 is a loss for the nation as a whole But what if they turn to a domestic supplier   say  a U S  company that will sell the product for  120  How does this change the story Here the crucial thing is that producing a good domestically has an opportunity cost  The U S  is near full employment  so the  120 in resources used to produce that good could and would have been employed producing something else in the absence of the tariff  Diverting them into producing what we used to import means a net loss of  20  with no revenue offset By the way  in practice any manufacturing jobs added by the Trump tariffs are probably offset by losses of other manufacturing jobs  Partly that s because most of the tariffs are on intermediate goods   inputs into production  so that job gains in  say  steel are offset by losses in autos and other downstream sectors  Beyond that  the tariffs have probably contributed to a rising dollar  which makes U S  exports less competitive Putting it all together  the Trump tariffs have raised consumer prices  rather than depressing foreign earnings  Some revenue has been gained  but there has also been what amounts to tax avoidance as consumers turn to other  untaxed sources of what we used to import  But this tax avoidance itself comes at a cost  so the U S  as a whole is left poorer Now  the numbers aren t that big  The new paper puts the net welfare loss at  1 4 billion a month  or  17 billion a year  that s less than 0 1 percent of U S  GDP  But winning it isn t  And the numbers could get a lot bigger if the trade war expands  say with a  national security  tariff on European cars The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to

WASHINGTON   The United States and South Korea will suspend two large scale joint military exercises this spring  two American officials said Friday  as part of President Trump s efforts to maintain the truce he has struck with Kim Jong un  the leader of North Korea A limited version of the training drills  however  are still expected to go forward  officials said  The United States and South Korea have long held large scale exercises in the spring  known as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle   the latter of which usually includes thousands of ground  naval  air and special operations troops from both nations The decision to scale back the military exercises follows nuclear talks this week between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kim that ended without an agreement on how   or whether   to shut down North Korea s nuclear weapons program  As the Trump administration continues to seek a resolution  a Defense Department official said  the high profile missile exercises that Pyongyang views as provocative will be toned down The official said the decision to formally suspend the large scale drills was expected to be announced by the United States and South Korea in the next few days  It was first reported by NBC News It is the latest in a series of planned military exercises that Washington and Seoul have canceled in the past year in order to avoid roiling Pyongyang  Mr  Trump has also said that the war drills cost too much Pentagon officials had braced for another suspension after the latest nuclear talks  Suspending exercises can hamper military readiness At the end of the summit meeting in Hanoi  Vietnam  on Thursday  Mr  Trump again called the exercises  very expensive   Look  you know  exercising is fun and it s nice and they play the war games   Mr  Trump told journalists in Hanoi   And I m not saying it s not necessary  because  at some levels  it is  But at other levels  it s not  Last June  without consulting the Pentagon  the president suspended major military exercises with South Korea after meeting Mr  Kim in Singapore  Two months later  Mr  Trump rebuked then Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for opening the door to resuming the exercises Mr  Mattis has since resigned Still  American and South Korean soldiers  airmen and sailors have continued to carry out joint training sessions  In addition  the two sides have staged so called tabletop or virtual exercises that they have not advertised Top military officials acknowledge that in many ways  large scale exercises like Foal Eagle are meant to deter North Korea with a show of force to demonstrate the capabilities of the United States and South Korean militaries 
WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is close to a trade deal with China that would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific but may do little to achieve the substantive changes to China s economy that the United States initially set out to win  people with knowledge of the talks said Significant details remain unsettled and the deal is still being discussed but so far  the two sides have agreed on a pact that would largely require Beijing to make big purchases of American agricultural and energy goods and to lower some barriers that prevent American companies from operating in China  In return  the United States would most likely drop its tariffs on at least  200 billion of the  250 billion worth of Chinese imports currently subject to American levies China  which has retaliated against President Trump s tariffs with its own punishing taxes on American goods  is pushing for the elimination of all of the Trump tariffs  a person with knowledge of the negotiations said  It is unclear whether the Trump administration will agree to remove all the tariffs or keep some in place to keep pressure on China  As part of the agreement  the Trump administration has been pushing China to accept an enforcement mechanism that would enable the United States to quickly reinstate tariffs if Beijing fails to live up to specific promises For Mr  Trump  the ability to announce a deal with China would constitute a victory for a presidency rocked by legal investigations and failed nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea last week  Mr  Trump has spent more than a year accusing China of unfair trade practices and promising to shift the balance of economic power back to the United States The agreement under discussion would expand markets for American financial services firms and farmers  in part by requiring that China buy large amounts of energy and farm goods  like liquid natural gas and soybeans But early details indicate it would do little to substantively change the way China has long done business and would not force Beijing to curtail cybertheft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for American companies The language aimed at China s discrimination against foreign companies  like its antimonopoly law or standard setting processes  is probably too vague to be enforceable  while China s promises on curtailing subsidies are also overly broad  a person familiar with the negotiation said  The pact also doesn t alter China s tight restrictions on data  the person said  In addition  many of the big purchases that Beijing is promising would occur over a number of years  which could give China further leverage during that period  critics say Regardless of what Mr  Trump s negotiators agree upon  no deal will be final until the president signs onto the agreement  Since starting his trade war last year  Mr  Trump has vacillated between accusing China of destroying American jobs and playing up his strong relationship with President Xi Jinping and his ability to reach a trade deal  Mr  Trump recently began dangling a signing event with Mr  Xi at Mar a Lago  the president s resort  and that ceremony seems to be coming together for later this month  While Mr  Trump wanted a summit meeting earlier in the month  the event could occur at the end of March  after Mr  Xi finishes a scheduled trip through Europe  according to people familiar with the discussions China very much wants to present the image that a deal is at hand as several thousand top officials of the Chinese Communist Party and hundreds of the country s most prominent business leaders gathered in Beijing over the weekend for the annual session of the legislature  the National People s Congress  which starts on Tuesday The Chinese government has been willing to discuss moves that it perceives as being in China s interest  from long term purchases of commodities that are needed for Chinese factories to changes in China s foreign investment law that make it a more attractive place for overseas companies to operate  But people familiar with the Chinese government s stance say it is determined to say no to policy changes that do not benefit its interest ImagePresident Trump with China s president  Xi Jinping  in Beijing in November 2017  Any trade deal still needs the approval of both leaders CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesBeijing has carried out most of the legal work needed for the legislature to pass a new  comprehensive law on investment by foreign businesses that would help satisfy some of America s earlier demands  The law will be the framework for China to reduce its limits on foreign stakes in Chinese banks  insurers and asset management companies   something that Mr  Xi had agreed to do in November 2017  when Mr  Trump came to Beijing for talks ahead of the trade war In a congressional hearing last week  Robert Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  signaled a long road ahead to reaching an agreement but said the United States would push for a substantive deal that did not merely result in purchases of American goods  What we want is fair trade that requires structural change and it has to be enforceable   Mr  Lighthizer said He said the United States and China were working to establish an enforcement mechanism that would involve an extensive series of meetings at various levels of government and the threat of tariffs if China was found to have violated the trade agreement The Chinese continue to be concerned that  after they have made concessions to get to the brink of a deal  Mr  Trump will be convinced by more hawkish voices in the media or the administration to try to press China for even more  said Eswar Prasad  a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution The trade deal under discussion stems from the Trump administration s findings last March that Beijing was engaging in unfair trade practices  including pressuring or requiring American companies to transfer their technology and intellectual property to Chinese partners as a condition of doing business in the country  The investigation found that China s practices hurt American exports  job numbers and wages Mr  Trump has long attacked China s economic practices  likening it to a  rape of our country  and  the greatest theft in the history of the world  while campaigning for the White House The president has continued to accuse China of engaging in nefarious practices to get a leg up in global trade and has imposed tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods to pressure Beijing to stop  The trade war  which has raged for months  has begun to hurt American companies that depend on China for sales and production  and many large multinational firms have said the trade war will crimp 2019 profits David Loevinger  who was the Treasury s senior coordinator for China affairs in the first term of the Obama administration  said he thought there was too much optimism in China and the United States that a trade deal would roll back most or all of the tariffs that President Trump imposed last year  What s very clear is we ve reached the peak of the tariff war   said Mr  Loevinger  now a managing director for emerging markets at TCW  an asset management company in Los Angeles   The question is how much of a rollback do we get   my expectation is probably not very much  Last week  Mr  Trump said he would delay imposing higher tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods  citing substantial progress in trade talks  On Saturday  Mr  Trump said he was asking China to end its retaliatory tariffs on meat and other products  I have asked China to immediately remove all Tariffs on our agricultural products  including beef  pork  etc   based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with Trade discussions and I did not increase their second traunch of Tariffs to 25  on March 1st   the president wrote Saturday on Twitter   This is very important for our great farmers   and me  
LOUMBILA  Burkina Faso   President Trump has ordered most American troops to withdraw from Syria  He wants to bring home thousands more from Afghanistan  Now hundreds of United States commandos and other forces are leaving West Africa   despite an onslaught of attacks from an increasingly deadly matrix of Islamist fighters The shift has unnerved African commanders in Burkina Faso and neighboring nations in the Sahel  a vast sub Saharan scrubland increasingly racked by bombings  massacres  kidnappings and attacks on hotels frequented by Westerners  It is a region in which most Americans were unaware of United States military involvement until four Army soldiers were killed in a deadly 2017 ambush in Niger by Islamic State fighters What is emerging  critics said  is a glimpse of what happens when American troops  especially Special Operations forces  pull back before insurgents are effectively subdued  leaving local or allied forces to fend off the Islamic State  Al Qaeda or their offshoots  It s a real problem   Col  Maj  Moussa Salaou Barmou  commander of Niger s Special Operations forces  said of the drawdown and the closing of seven of eight American elite counterterrorism units operating in Africa  For more coverage of the experiences and costs of war  sign up for the weekly At War newsletter  Under the Trump administration s military strategy  the Pentagon has pivoted from focusing on counterterrorism operations to potential threats from China and Russia  In December  President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all 2 000 American troops from Syria  although he since has softened it to allow at least 400 remain  A new Pentagon plan also would pull all 14 000 American troops from Afghanistan over the next five years   and as many as 7 000 in coming months   as part of continuing peace talks with the Taliban The American military is scaling back its commandos in Africa by about 25 percent  mainly in the continent s west  At the same time  insurgents are attacking

violent extremism   came during a counterterrorism exercise in Burkina Faso last week that drew 2 000 military personnel from more than 30 African and Western countries  The threat is gaining ground   Foreign Minister Alpha Barry of Burkina Faso told a security conference in Munich in February   It s no longer just the Sahel  it s coastal West Africa and the risk of spreading regionally  France  the former colonial power in West Africa  maintains 4 500 troops in the region to help battle insurgents in Niger  Chad and Mali  where it routed Al Qaeda s affiliate from the north in 2013  French officials said the Pentagon had assured them it would keep providing intelligence  logistics and aerial refueling in what Prime Minister Édouard Philippe called  a hard fight   while visiting troops in Mali last week The American military has a relatively light footprint across Africa  relying on European and African partners to carry out most counterterrorism missions from the Sahel to Somalia  with the Pentagon providing air power when needed  The United States has already conducted 24 airstrikes this year against Shabab targets in Somalia  compared with 47 all of 2018 About 6 000 United States troops and 1 000 Defense Department civilians or contractors work throughout Africa  mainly training and conducting exercises with local forces ImageMalian soldiers at a firing range  The

Jared Kushner slipped quietly into Saudi Arabia this week for a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  so the question I m trying to get the White House to answer is this  Did they discuss American help for a Saudi nuclear program Of all the harebrained and unscrupulous dealings of the Trump administration in the last two years  one of the most shocking is a Trump plan to sell nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia that could be used to make nuclear weapons Even as President Trump is trying to denuclearize North Korea and Iran  he may be helping to nuclearize Saudi Arabia  This is abominable policy tainted by a gargantuan conflict of interest involving Kushner Kushner s family real estate business had been teetering because of a disastrously overpriced acquisition he made of a particular Manhattan property called 666 Fifth Avenue  but last August a company called Brookfield Asset Management rescued the Kushners by taking a 99 year lease of the troubled property   and paying the whole sum of about  1 1 billion up front Alarm bells should go off  Brookfield also owns Westinghouse Electric  the nuclear services business trying to sell reactors to Saudi Arabia Saudi swamp  meet American swamp It may be conflicts like these  along with even murkier ones  that led American intelligence officials to refuse a top secret security clearance for Kushner  The Times reported Thursday that Trump overruled them to grant Kushner the clearance  Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world  shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes  For a behind the scenes look at Nick s gritty journalism  sign up for his newsletter  This nuclear reactor mess began around the time of Trump s election  when a group of retired U S  national security officials put together a plan to enrich themselves by selling nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia  The officials included Michael Flynn  Trump s national security adviser  and they initially developed a  plan for 40 nuclear power plants  in Saudi Arabia  according to a report from the House Oversight and Reform Committee  The plan is now to start with just a couple of plants As recently as Feb  12  Trump met in the White House with backers of the project and was supportive  Reuters reported These are civilian nuclear power plants  and Saudi Arabia claims it wants them for electricity  But the Saudis insist on producing their own nuclear fuel  rather than buying it more cheaply abroad  Producing fuel is a standard way for rogue countries to divert fuel for secret nuclear weapons programs  and the Saudi resistance to safeguards against proliferation bolsters suspicions that the real goal is warheads Trump may be vigilant  destructively so  about Iran s nuclear plants  but in the Saudi case his response seems to be  There s money to be made  When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised objections to the transfer last year  Axios reported   Trump and his advisers told Netanyahu that  if the U S  does not sell the Saudis nuclear reactors  other countries like Russia or France will  Trump seems to believe that the Saudis have us over a barrel  If we don t help them with nuclear technology  someone else will  That misunderstands the U S  Saudi relationship  The Saudis depend on us for their security  and the blunt truth is that we hold all the cards in this relationship  not them Why on earth would America put Prince Mohammed on a path to acquiring nuclear weapons  He is already arguably the most destabilizing leader in an unstable region  for he has invaded Yemen  kidnapped Lebanon s prime minister  started a feud with Qatar  and  according to American intelligence officials  ordered the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi The prince has also imprisoned and brutally tortured women s rights activists  including one who I m hoping will win the Nobel Peace Prize  Loujain al Hathloul  As Representative Brad Sherman  a California Democrat  has noted   A country that can t be trusted with a bone saw shouldn t be trusted with nuclear weapons  The White House won t clarify whether Kushner discussed the nuclear issue when he met Prince Mohammed a few days ago  but Senator Jeff Merkley  an Oregon Democrat  told me   I d be surprised if it didn t come up   Along with Senators Ed Markey  a Massachusetts Democrat  and Rand Paul  a Kentucky Republican  Merkley has introduced a resolution to oppose the transfer of nuclear technology that would allow Saudi Arabia to create nuclear weapons There s another element of Trump s Saudi policy that is simply repulsive  the fawning courtship of a foreign prince who has created in Yemen the world s worst humanitarian crisis  murdered a journalist and tortured women s rights activists  The White House genuflections are such that Prince Mohammed had a point when  according to The Intercept  he bragged that he had Kushner in his  pocket  No one knows whether Prince Mohammed will manage to succeed his father and become the next king  for there is opposition and the Saudi economic transformation he boasts of is running into difficulties  Trump and Kushner seem to be irresponsibly trying to boost the prince s prospects  increasing the risk that an unstable hothead will mismanage the kingdom for the next 50 years  Perhaps with nuclear weapons Read More From

airstrikes across the Kashmir divide  Elsewhere in Asia  negotiations between Mr  Trump and North Korea s leader  Kim Jong un  to begin a denuclearization process have abruptly ended  The thickest  weight bearing strands of this safety net are treaties that have been cast aside without being replaced  With diplomacy sidelined  policymakers are left with nuclear threats to deter competitors  But deterrence rests on the underlying possibility of the use of nuclear weapons  otherwise  they would cease to deter  This can lead to tragic miscalculations  Treaties  by contrast  muffle and reduce threats  So  strengthening  deterrence without treaties and diplomacy is dangerous  it s a recipe for threatening your way into tight corners  as India and Pakistan have again shown  Hope to find an alternative to deterrence springs eternal  Some strategies seek escape through abolition of nuclear arms or the missiles that could deliver them  Others aim for victory rather than deterrence  by putting a protective missile defense shield in space  Those brands of escapism invite failure and heighten nuclear dangers  while the combination of deterrence and diplomacy has a proven record  One of the great ironies of the Cold War is that the acceptance of mutual vulnerability backstopped three decades of nuclear arms control and  eventually  deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the United States But now  killing treaties has become another form of escapism  After the Sept  11 attacks  the George W  Bush administration announced America s withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed between the two superpowers in 1972  Mr  Putin s response was to walk away from a 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that prohibited land based missiles from carrying multiple warheads  or MIRVs  Eliminating these missiles was a long sought goal of arms control  Now Russia is deploying MIRVed missiles in the worst possible way   with easily targeted  slow to use liquid fueled missiles based in silos   conditions that could provoke a launching at the first suspicion of an attack  even if unverified  for fear that they would be destroyed In August  Moscow and Washington seem set to leave the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987   the treaty that broke the back of the Cold War nuclear arms race  Mr  Trump has announced America s withdrawal without seeking to negotiate remedies to Russian violations  In his view  nothing less than destroying the offending Russian missiles would do  But now  Mr  Putin is free to deploy more of them Next up is  New Start   the sole surviving Russian American treaty that limits longer range missiles  It could be extended for another five years  but Mr  Trump and his national security adviser  John Bolton  have neither the diplomatic skills nor apparently an interest in extending its terms or negotiating better ones  On top of this  Mr  Trump and Mr  Bolton have championed new missile defense plans to protect every American city from any missiles from any origin The problem with such plans is that ground based missile defense interceptors remain woefully unable to do this   they don t have enough time to catch up to their targets  The only theoretical hope to protect American cities lies in space based interceptors  But that pursuit  like President Reagan s Strategic Defense Initiative  is most likely to again fail for technical  financial and political reasons  If the United States deploys interceptors in space  Russia and China will probably pursue countermeasures in the form of space mines that could trail American space based interceptors  at a small fraction of the cost  In other words  the hair trigger of terrestrial nuclear warfare would simply be duplicated in space How did we manage to survive the seven harrowing decades since Hiroshima and Nagasaki without the battlefield use of nuclear weapons  Deterrence alone didn t produce this result  the combination of deterrence and diplomacy did  This safety net was the greatest unacknowledged achievement during the Cold War  It now has very little load bearing capacity left The champions of jettisoning treaties have no sensible strategy or diplomatic road map to replace the nuclear safety net they are cutting  They rely on muscle flexing  dictation and unilateralism  which are mere postures  not strategy  This will not end well  Russia and China have the means to counter an America that seeks to escape deterrence and denigrate diplomacy  Nuclear dangers will rise as a result When the executive branch loses its moorings  it s up to Congress to steady the ship of state  Avoiding a new arms race will be difficult but not impossible  Mr  Putin knows he would lose it because America has superior technology and Russia s economy is in bad shape  China s strategy has been to avoid overspending on nuclear weapons while pursuing other means of negating American power  including with space and cyber warfare  Building up American nuclear capacity is not an effective counter to either of those Instead  Congress could choose to reduce nuclear excess through the power of the purse  Ordinarily  the job of orchestrating restraint is best left to the executive branch  and besides  Congress doesn t do nuance very well  But temporizing actions are probably the most we can do until there is a change in government  and stabilizing matters over the next two years will be hard to do  Still  a new arms race isn t foreordained   yet   and with enough common sense  we can avoid one The more Mr  Trump flails  Mr  Bolton tears down and Mr  Putin sows fear and broadcasts threats  the more Capitol Hill is obliged to step up  The nuclear safety net that previous generations bequeathed to us is in desperate need of repair  For the time being  there s nowhere else to turn but Congress Michael Krepon is a co founder of the Stimson Center  a Washington based

WASHINGTON   A powerful Democratic House committee chairman investigating possible abuses of the government s security clearance process stepped up demands on Friday to see key documents and interview potential witnesses from the White House in light of a new report that President Trump personally intervened to grant his son in law a top secret clearance despite legal and national security concerns The chairman  Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  who leads the House Oversight and Reform Committee  accused the White House in a new letter of stonewalling his requests for information and implied that if it did not comply voluntarily  he would issue a subpoena to compel its cooperation He said the report  published by The New York Times  added new concerns that Mr  Trump was lying to the public about his role in the clearance process to existing and broader questions about irregularities surrounding who should have access to sensitive government secrets  If true  these new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr  Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation s most sensitive secrets   Mr  Cummings wrote in a letter to Pat Cipollone  the White House counsel  The letter went on to ask about  why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation  why General Kelly and Mr  McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions  and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this Committee  The report in The New York Times said that Mr  Trump s intervention so concerned senior administration officials that John F  Kelly  then the White House chief of staff  documented the action in a contemporaneous internal memo that said he had been  ordered  to grant Mr  Kushner a top secret clearance The Times also reported that Donald F  McGahn II  then the White House counsel  wrote a memo of his own documenting concerns raised by the C I A  and other officials about Mr  Kushner  Mr  McGahn  the memo noted  had recommended against giving him such broad access to the government s secrets Mr  Trump told The Times in January in an Oval Office interview that he had no role in Mr  Kushner s clearance Mr  Cummings has been pursuing reported irregularities by the White House and the Trump transition team since 2017  when Republicans were in control of the House  But he started a broad inquiry of his own last month after taking control of the oversight panel  Congress s most muscular investigative body  which he said he hoped would shine light on any national security risks that may exist He has specifically requested information on the clearances of nine current and former administration officials  including Mr  Kushner  Among those whose clearances he intends to scrutinize are Mr  Trump s current and former national security advisers  John R  Bolton and Michael T  Flynn  his onetime staff secretary  Rob Porter  a former senior director on the National Security Council  Robin Townley  a former deputy national security adviser  K  T  McFarland  as well as Sebastian Gorka  a former deputy assistant to the president Mr  Cummings has also asked for documents related to a review of the security clearance process that Mr  Kelly conducted in 2018 that concluded there were serious flaws in the system meant to vet high level officials  And Mr  Cummings wants to talk to  all personnel in the White House Personnel Security Office  The White House  he said on Friday  has thus far not complied In a sign that House Democrats would seek to further elevate the issue in their oversight agenda  Representative Adam B  Schiff of California  the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  said on Thursday that his panel  responsible for overseeing American intelligence agencies  would work with Mr  Cummings  Mr  Schiff called Mr  Trump s actions the  latest indicator of the president s utter disregard for our national security and for the men and women who sacrifice so much every day to keep us safe

BRUSSELS   As diplomatic spats go  it was a spring shower in a teapot  not even a minor tempest  But European feelings were badly bruised last year when the Trump administration downgraded the diplomatic status of the European Union s delegation to the United States without making a formal announcement or even informing the bloc about the change The permanent reversal of that decision was announced on Monday  with the ambassador of the European Union to the United States now again considered to be equivalent to an ambassador from a country  not just to an envoy from an international organization The announcement was made with some fanfare by the American ambassador to the European Union  Gordon Sondland  whom European diplomats credit with pushing hard for the fix  In a statement  Mr  Sondland called the bloc  a uniquely important organization  and one of America s most valuable partners in ensuring global security and prosperity  President Trump has called the European Union  a foe  in economic competition with the United States  but Mr  Sondland said that  Europe s security and success are inextricably linked to that of the United States  and this level of engagement and cooperation should be recognized appropriately in all settings  It is a change in tone for Mr  Sondland  a hotelier and businessman from Washington State who has regularly criticized the European Union as being  out of touch   He has faulted the bloc for being obsessed with regulation and for not being eager enough to meet Mr  Trump s demands to lower the roughly  150 billion trade deficit in goods it has with the United States  though that figure ignores the American advantage in services  In an interview with Politico Europe in December  Mr  Sondland said of Brussels   There is clearly an effort to maintain the status quo  and we now have to recognize that the relationship and all of the good will that has been built up since the Marshall Plan doesn t seem to count when it comes to getting a little consideration  So we are going to have to do what we have to do  A month ago  Mr  Sondland said that the European Commission was  like a factory churning out regulation after regulation after regulation  Even regulating things that don t exist today on the theory that someday  someone is going to get hurt somewhere   He also warned that Washington would escalate a trade dispute    forced to do a tit for tat    if Brussels did not heed the Trump administration s demands Privately  Mr  Sondland is even more caustic  and European officials tend to raise their eyes when asked about his negotiating style  which they consider to be brash  But some of those same officials were also quick to praise Mr  Sondland for going to bat for the bloc in the protocol battle and for understanding that the change had been needlessly offensive The downgrade became evident at the December funeral of President George Bush  when the name of the European Union ambassador  David O Sullivan  was not called in the expected order  The names of diplomats who had gathered in Washington to pay their respects were spoken  as is custom  from the longest serving ambassador to the newest  but Mr  O Sullivan was called last The demotion that was apparent at the funeral came a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a blistering speech in Brussels  in which he questioned the value of multinational organizations like the United Nations and the European Union  Mr  Pompeo asked whether the European Union was  ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats  There followed quiet complaints through diplomatic channels from the European Union  and in January the downgrade was described as having been  temporarily reversed   The announcement of the permanent reinstatement came on Monday in a statement to welcome Mr  O Sullivan s replacement  Stavros Lambrinidis Christian Ehler  chairman of the European Parliament s delegation for relations with the United States  said that he welcomed the move but  would like to highlight that the downgrading was a mistake in the first place that has now been corrected  Mr  Ehler said that he hoped that the upgrade  will restore trust and will ensure the continuation of a close and constructive trans Atlantic cooperation  Marietje Schaake  a Dutch member of the European Parliament who is in Washington with a delegation to discuss the trans Atlantic relationship  said the downgrading  should never have happened  and we don t know why it happened   She added   it may have been just a mistake  Ms  Schaake said she was pleased that the rhetoric had become less insulting   The administration is often very direct and sometimes outright provocative   she said   But in the Congress you can hear a very different tone  In addition to Mr  Trump s regular criticism of NATO  the United States and the European Union have been at odds over the Iran nuclear deal  Mr  Trump has pulled out of that pact  while European allies have been seeking to preserve it  Washington and Brussels are also at loggerheads over climate change  after Mr  Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris accord The two sides have also been engaged in sometimes vicious negotiations about trade and about American tariffs on European steel The Trump administration is also threatening new  national security  tariffs on imported cars  in an effort to reduce the American trade deficit with the European Union  a threat that hangs over current negotiations with Brussels and that is aimed foremost at Germany  And Washington has sharply criticized Berlin for supporting the Nord Stream 2  a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany 
A dual citizen of Saudi Arabia and the United States had been imprisoned in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh for about a week when he heard a knock on his door Guards dragged Walid Fitaihi  a Harvard trained physician  to another room  according to a friend who took down the prisoner s detailed account of his treatment  Dr  Fitaihi told the friend he was slapped  blindfolded  stripped to his underwear and bound to a chair  He was shocked with electricity in what appears to have been a single session of torture that lasted about an hour His tormentors whipped his back so severely that he could not sleep on it for days  his friend said  speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals  The doctor had described the physical abuse  in general terms  to his relatives as well  a person close to them said Detained in November 2017 in what was billed as a crackdown on corruption  Dr  Fitaihi  54  remains imprisoned without any public charges or trial  About 200 prominent Saudis were detained with him  and he is one of dozens who remain in prison Friends and families of others detained have also described episodes of torture  At least 17 detainees were hospitalized soon after the crackdown for injuries sustained while in custody  according to a doctor at the hospital and an American official monitoring the crackdown ImageJared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and Middle East adviser  with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2017  They met again this past week CreditJonathan Ernst ReutersA military officer who had been detained died with a twisted neck and other signs of abuse on his body  according to a person who saw it  Women s rights advocates jailed in Saudi Arabia have said they were also tortured  including by electrical shocks  according to their relatives and rights groups But Dr  Fitaihi s American citizenship means that his mistreatment  which has not been previously reported  may now pose a special threat to Saudi relations with Washington  The Trump administration is already struggling to quell a bipartisan backlash against the kingdom over the killing last fall of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi  a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist who was executed and dismembered by a team of Saudi agents in the kingdom s consulate in Istanbul This past week  Jared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and Middle East adviser  met for the first time since the killing with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  the de facto ruler of the kingdom  American intelligence agencies have concluded that the crown prince ordered Mr  Khashoggi s killing Mr  Kushner met with  Prince Mohammed to promote a potential resolution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict in which the prince and his country may play a big role The Trump administration  meanwhile  has defied a congressional deadline to report about who was responsible for the killing  Instead  President Trump has equivocated about whether Prince Mohammed might have authorized it  even as he has extolled the value of Saudi Arabian oil sales and defense contracts American friends of Dr  Fitaihi are stepping up a campaign to press Washington to take up his case  They say the Trump administration s public silence about his incarceration is at odds with Mr  Trump s repeated boasts about his successful efforts to extricate American citizens held abroad Mr  Trump

priority will send a message that America isn t really first   she said in text message to The New York Times   Financial deals and petroleum are  Howard M  Cooper  a lawyer for Dr  Fitaihi  said in a letter to the State Department in January that he had indicated to his wife and family that  he is in fear for his life  that he cannot take his situation any longer  and that he desires all possible help   A State Department representative declined to comment on the case  citing privacy considerations Saudi officials have denied any mistreatment of detainees  A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington said the kingdom has signed the convention against torture and prohibits its use  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia takes any and all allegations of ill treatment of defendants awaiting trial or prisoners serving their sentences very seriously   the spokesman said Dr  Fitaihi got his American citizenship while studying and practicing medicine in the United States  where one of his sons lives  After returning to Saudi Arabia  he founded a private hospital in Jeddah and became well known as a motivational speaker The reason for his detention is unclear  But the friend who relayed Dr  Fitaihi s account of his treatment said that he was questioned primarily about a relative by marriage who had also been detained  Adel Fakeih  a former top aide to the crown prince  Dr  Fitaihi believed his interrogators were seeking evidence against Mr  Fakeih  the friend said Announcing the end of its corruption purge at the end of January  Saudi Arabia said that 64 people were still being held for

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration issued a new round of visa restrictions and economic sanctions on Friday against the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela  who has given little indication that he will cede control despite a prediction by a top American envoy that his  dictatorship  would come to an end   quickly and peacefully  The envoy  Elliott Abrams  also noted the possibility of American military intervention  as requested by Juan Guaidó  the Venezuelan opposition leader  But he described it as a distant line of action behind other moves meant to ratchet up diplomatic and economic pressure against Mr  Maduro  We continue to say  and we always will  that all options are on the table   Mr  Abrams told reporters at the State Department   But I think that anyone who actually looks at American policy in Venezuela could not reach that conclusion  Vice President Mike Pence  who has visited the region five times  largely to put pressure on Mr  Maduro  said this week that he personally reassured Mr  Guaidó that military intervention was on the table  But  he said  that decision was ultimately up to President Trump The Trump administration this week escalated its campaign to pressure Mr  Maduro to step down  even as adversarial governments  including Russia  have become involved in the conflict In January  with White House support  Mr  Guaidó declared himself Venezuela s interim president after accusations of electoral fraud and corruption by the Maduro government that have sent the country s economy into hyperinflation and poverty Mr  Abrams swatted away a suggestion made by Sergey V  Lavrov  the Russian foreign minister  that the United States was pondering immediate military intervention Instead  Mr  Abrams said  the Trump administration is focused on relatively modest sanctions that were announced on Friday and earlier this week  including those against at least 10 Venezuelan government officials and members of Mr  Maduro s inner circle  accusing them of abuse of power and of blocking aid to the country Mr  Abrams also announced visa restrictions for  dozens  of Mr  Maduro s associates  some of whom he said may be in the United States  He said he was prohibited from naming the Venezuelan officials and their family members whose visas were revoked but cited a  mix  of people both inside and outside the United States In recent days  White House officials have tried to maintain pressure on Mr  Maduro  who emerged relatively unfazed after a largely failed American backed effort to send convoys of humanitarian aid into Venezuela last weekend  Efforts to persuade its soldiers to defect degenerated into clashes and mayhem between anti Maduro protesters and Venezuelan security forces along the borders with Colombia and Brazil Only a smattering of aid got through  and it did little if anything to loosen Mr  Maduro s control Mr  Pence met on Monday with Mr  Guaidó in Colombia  On Friday  he declared that  Nicolás Maduro must go  in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington  Nicolás Maduro is a dictator with no claim to power   Mr  Pence said Since violating a travel ban and slipping across the Venezuelan border into Colombia last week  Mr  Guaidó has traveled through Latin America in an effort to build an international coalition against Mr  Maduro  He has vowed to return to Venezuela in the coming days  though he has said he cannot be sure of what will happen once he arrives  Of course  it is a risk   Mr  Guaidó said in a news conference in Brazil on Thursday   even life threatening  For his part  Mr  Maduro has called Mr  Guaidó a coup plotter and a Trump administration lackey  and has described the humanitarian aid effort as a pretext for an American invasion directed from Colombia  He broke diplomatic relations with Colombia on Saturday in retaliation Mr  Abrams warned that any action taken against Mr  Guaidó would be met with an outcry on behalf of the Venezuelan people and the international community As Mr  Trump and his advisers mull options  the Russian government has aligned with Mr  Maduro  sending aid and expressing support for the Venezuelan president s government  Russia will continue to assist the Venezuelan authorities in resolving social and economic problems  including through the provision of legitimate humanitarian aid   Mr  Lavrov said at a news conference on Friday with Delcy Rodríguez  the Venezuelan vice president  Russia has pledged to provide food and medicine to the Maduro government  a move that Mr  Abrams questioned as a possible  political weapon    one that he said could be intended to help Mr  Maduro s supporters and not Venezuelans who oppose his government Mr  Lavrov also said that military intervention on behalf of the United States would be  in defiance of all international norms   His comments were quickly brushed aside by John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump s national security adviser  who has in recent days taken to Twitter to lash out at Mr  Maduro s government  Talks between Russia and Maduro s cronies are only useful if they are discussing retirement beaches for Maduro   Mr  Bolton said on Friday   Change is the only way forward in Venezuela  
Good Monday   Want this by email  Sign up here  An expected China trade deal lacks teethThe Trump administration is nearing a trade deal with China that would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific  Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT write What America could get   The deal would  require Beijing to make big purchases of American agricultural and energy goods and to lower some barriers that prevent American companies from operating in China    The potential agreement  would expand markets for American financial services firms and farmers  in part by requiring that China buy large amounts of energy and farm goods  like liquid natural gas and soybeans     The Trump administration has also been pushing China to accept an enforcement mechanism that would enable the United States to quickly reinstate tariffs if Beijing fails to live up to specific promises  And China    In return  the United States would most likely drop its tariffs on at least  200 billion of the  250 billion worth of Chinese imports currently subject to American levies    Beijing is also  pushing for the elimination of all of the Trump tariffs  a person with knowledge of the negotiations said   But  early details indicate it would do little to substantively change the way China has long done business and would not force Beijing to curtail cyber theft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for American companies     The language aimed at China s discrimination against foreign companies  like its antimonopoly law or standard setting processes  is probably too vague to be enforceable   according to an unidentified source    The pact also doesn t alter China s tight restrictions on data   and  many of the big purchases that Beijing is promising would occur over a number of years  which could give China further leverage  More  How Apple prevailed in the trade war  And why President Trump s battle hasn t helped narrow the trade deficit Huawei plans to sue the U S The Chinese telecom giant plans to take the U S  government to court for banning federal agencies from using its products  Ray Zhong and Paul Mozur of the NYT report    The move could be aimed at forcing the United States government to more publicly make its case against the Chinese equipment maker     It is part of a broad push by Huawei to defend itself against a campaign led by the United States to undermine the company  which Washington sees as a security threat    Huawei s lawsuit will challenge a section in a defense spending law that blocks federal agencies from

ReutersTrump s 2020 campaign shocks with 5G planOn Friday  the Trump re election campaign   including its manager  Brad Parscale  and an adviser  Newt Gingrich   called for a nationwide  wholesale  5G network  that would allow the government to control the spectrum and find a way to share it with carriers  A 5G wholesale market would drive down costs and provide access to millions of Americans who

John Hickenlooper  the former governor of Colorado  faces a basic challenge in the crowded Democratic presidential primary  He is a centrist in a party that s moving to the left  While he has shifted in some areas  he will still be running to the right of the most prominent candidates  with more of an emphasis on pragmatism than idealism  Read about Mr  Hickenlooper s entrance into the race here  Here are some of the issues he s likely to discuss Gun controlMr  Hickenlooper spent eight years as mayor of Denver  less than 10 miles from the sites of two of the nation s worst mass shootings  Columbine High School and Aurora  Colo  He was governor at the time of the Aurora theater shooting  in which 12 people were killed and more than 50 were injured  In the aftermath  Colorado legislators passed universal background checks and a ban on high capacity magazines  Mr  Hickenlooper wants to enact similar policies  along with a higher minimum age to buy certain firearms  at the federal level  Gun violence is the real national emergency plaguing our nation   he tweeted after the shooting last month in Aurora  Ill Notably  Mr  Hickenlooper did not always support gun control  Shortly after the theater shooting in 2012  he told ABC that the gunman was  diabolical  and would have found another way to carry out his massacre if guns had not been available  a common argument from gun control opponents  But by the time the background check and magazine bills reached his desk  he had changed his mind and signed them  He continues to promote the restrictions as a selling point in his record Health careMr  Hickenlooper supports universal health care in principle but has refused to get behind specific proposals like  Medicare for all   Speaking in New Hampshire last month  he said that there were  many different ways to cut the pie and work on the issue  and that intraparty arguments over the specifics were counterproductive He did  however  explicitly reject the idea of eliminating private insurance companies  as promoted by Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris During his governorship  Mr  Hickenlooper and Colorado s divided Legislature expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act  a fact he highlighted as speculation about a possible presidential run increased The environmentAs governor  Mr  Hickenlooper   a former geologist   added Colorado to the U S  Climate Alliance  a group of states working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to counter the Trump administration s environmental policies  He also signed an executive order mandating  by 2025  a 26 percent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels  and emphasized the economic potential of renewable energy  He has called for a more aggressive response to climate change  and expressed tentative support for the Green New Deal But in contrast to many other Democrats  he has supported the controversial process of hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  and his policies as governor were generally friendly to the oil and gas industries  For instance  he opposed a ballot initiative in Colorado that would have limited where oil wells could be built   Voters rejected the measure in November  Free tradeMr  Hickenlooper supports trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans Pacific Partnership  a position that puts him at odds with both President Trump and some of his more liberal competitors in the Democratic primary  Last year  in the final months of his term as governor  he and John Kasich  then the Republican governor of Ohio  wrote a letter to the Trump administration opposing the tariffs and the adversarial tone of its efforts to renegotiate Nafta The letter emphasized the effects of those policies on rural and blue collar communities  many of which voted for Mr  Trump but have suffered economically as a result of his tariffs 
Calling it a  mere pretext  for sinister intent  Russia vetoed an American resolution in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday for new elections and unhindered distribution of humanitarian aid in Venezuela It was the latest clash in a Cold War style quarrel playing out amid the chaos unfolding in Venezuela  once Latin America s most prosperous country From the outset  there was little hope the American measure would surmount opposition from Russia  which proposed a rival resolution that was roundly rejected by the Security Council China  another permanent member of the council  also opposed the American resolution The Kremlin has aligned closely with President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela even as the United States and about 50 other countries  many of them in Latin America and Europe  have renounced relations with him They have accused Mr  Maduro s government of grossly mismanaging the country and driving the economy to the brink of collapse  causing a humanitarian catastrophe that has forced more than 3 4 million to flee These countries have thrown their support behind Juan Guaidó  the 35 year old leader of the opposition in Venezuela s National Assembly  who declared himself president last month  On Thursday he arrived in Brazil for talks with that country s president  Jair Bolsonaro  a harsh Maduro critic In remarks before the Security Council  Elliott Abrams  the Trump administration s special representative for Venezuela  referred to the  corrupt former Maduro regime   and urged a  peaceful transition to democracy   Regardless of the results of today s vote  this resolution shows that democracies around the world and especially in Latin America are mobilizing behind interim President Guaidó   Mr  Abrams said Nine countries in the 15 member Security Council voted for the American measure  enough for it to have passed had Russia and China not voted against it  Any  no  vote by a permanent member vetoes a resolution Though the American resolution said nothing about possible military intervention  President Trump has said that  all options are open   a sentiment that Mr  Abrams echoed in his remarks Russia and others have accused the United States of plotting to overthrow Mr  Maduro by force  a possibility that even harsh critics of the current regime strongly oppose  Hypocritical concerns about the humanitarian situation in the country is a mere pretext   said Vassily A  Nebenzia  Russia s ambassador to the United Nations  Washington is obstinately seeking to escalate tensions and to implement their scenario for an unconstitutional change of government   he said  He later referenced the role of the United States in the overthrow of Muammar el Qaddafi in Libya in 2011 as an example of why the stated humanitarian goals of American officials cannot be trusted  If the United States were genuinely keen to help the people of Venezuela   Mr  Nebenzia said   then they would operate through official channels  through any of the U N  accredited agencies in that country  But that s not their goal  Mr  Maduro s popularity in Venezuela has plummeted as basic services and institutions buckle under the strain of economic collapse  Food  medicine and fuel have grown increasingly scarce Mr  Maduro and his supporters have blamed the economic crisis on sanctions imposed by the United States  In January  the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Venezuela s state owned oil company and froze  7 billion in assets  cutting off the country s most important source of revenue In his remarks on Thursday  Venezuela s ambassador  Samuel Moncada Acosta  described Venezuela as  completely at peace   but denounced what he described as a  colonial intervention  by the United States 
MOSCOW   President Vladimir V  Putin on Monday formally suspended Russia s observance of a key nuclear arms treaty that the United States withdrew from last month  setting the stage for the return of a long banned class of weapons The Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  signed in 1987 in the waning years of the Cold War  had prohibited land based missiles with relatively short ranges of 300 to 3 400 miles  Because of their quick flight times  such missiles were seen as a hair trigger for nuclear war The United States has for years accused Russia of violating the treaty by understating the range of one of its truck launched missiles  The Obama administration pressed the issue during the crisis over Russia s invasion of Ukraine  and President Trump cited it when he announced the United States  decision to withdraw Mr  Trump also pointed out that China  which was never a party to the treaty  has been free to amass its own arsenal of the missiles Mr  Putin said last month that Russia would respond  symmetrically  to the American move  a decision formalized Monday with a decree posted on the Kremlin s website The decree  said Russia would suspend its observance because of  the need to take urgent measures in connection with the United States  violations of its obligations  under the treaty In announcing the decision in February  Mr  Putin had said Russia would design and build weapons previously banned under the treaty   something the United States says Russia is already doing   but would not deploy them unless America did so first Both Russia and the United States have sea  and air launched missiles that fly within the ranges covered by the treaty  Russia s defense minister has said the country will design and test a land based launcher for its maritime cruise missile  an analogue to the American Tomahawk that Moscow calls the Kalibr  and a new short range ballistic missile Russia s accusation that the United States had violated the treaty was a possible reference to America s decision to suspend observance of it  or to earlier accusations that Russia had leveled against the United States about its military capabilities Russia had maintained that American armed drones fly within ranges banned by the treaty  though this class of weapon did not exist in the 1980s  and that United States missile defense sites in Europe use launchers capable of firing short  and intermediate range missiles 
WASHINGTON   A federal judge on Monday rejected a request that he speed up consideration of a lawsuit filed on behalf of Hoda Muthana  an American born woman who joined the Islamic State group in 2014 and is now stranded in a refugee camp in Syria with her 18 month old son  the child of a slain ISIS fighter But the judge  Reggie Walton of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia  also suggested that he took a positive view of legal arguments that Ms  Muthana may be an American citizen  contrary to the government s declaration that she is not one The fate of Ms  Muthana  whose family lives in Alabama  has raised novel legal issues and become a political flash point since she surrendered to coalition forces fighting ISIS and said last month that she wanted to come home  In response  the Trump administration said she was not a citizen and would not be allowed back The judge s ruling that there are insufficient grounds to expedite the litigation means that her case is unlikely to be resolved until late spring or summer  But his comments also provide a reason to believe that she may ultimately prevail  Charlie Swift  a lawyer hired by her father  said after the hearing that he was  encouraged  by Judge Walton s views and hoped it was  foreshadowing  of the outcome In 2015  Ms  Muthana withdrew from college and used her tuition reimbursement to fund her travel to Syria  Once there  she touted ISIS s ideology on social media  including calling on Muslims in America to carry out terrorist attacks  But she now says she is sorry and wants to come home  Mr  Swift said she had wanted to leave earlier but feared being executed if she tried to leave The State Department canceled her passport in 2016   under the Obama administration   and the Justice Department is taking the position that she does not qualify to be an American citizen under an exception to birthright citizenship in the Constitution for children of foreign diplomats Ms  Muthana s father was a diplomat from Yemen  but was discharged from that post shortly before she was born  The United States government only learned of that change after she was born  raising the question of whether his diplomatic status expired before or after her birth Her father has filed a lawsuit asking for declarations that she remains a citizen and that he may send her money without violating the law  He is also asking Judge Walton to order the government to take steps to take custody of her and his grandson from the Kurdish led Syrian Democratic Forces now holding them and to bring them to American soil On Monday  Mr  Swift argued that Ms  Muthana and her son are in danger  including because other ISIS members now see her as a heretic  He also said Mr  Trump s intention to withdraw troops from Syria means the window of opportunity for the American government to get her out may be closing  And he emphasized that she would likely be prosecuted if she returns Mr  Swift also said the Justice Department s argument that a discharged former diplomat keeps his status until the United States government is notified of the change would produce absurd results  like letting former diplomats remain immune from prosecution for crimes committed during any lag period Foreign adversaries could exploit such a rule  he said  by quietly discharging diplomats while instructing them to commit espionage or sabotage  If such operatives were caught  they would have legal impunity while permitting those foreign governments to deny any responsibility Judge Walton said he had decided to handle the case on the normal timetable because the arguments that Ms  Muthana faced irreparable harm from delay were too speculative  But he also said Mr  Swift had offered good arguments for why it  didn t make sense  to interpret diplomatic status as lingering after a discharge if the American government does not receive notice right away Last month  Senator Doug Jones  Democrat of Alabama  said Ms  Muthana should return to the United States and be prosecuted  Americans who joined ISIS   or were arrested as they tried to travel to Syria   have been routinely charged and convicted of providing material support to terrorism But President Trump said he had directed the government not to allow her back  and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement declaring that she  is not a U S  citizen and will not be admitted into the United States   In an interview with Gray News broadcast Sunday night  Mr  Pompeo reiterated that Ms  Muthana is not welcome back  She has no right to come back to the United States of America   he said   She s not a U S  citizen  She has no claim for U S  citizenship  That s what we ll be telling the court because that s the truth  
To the Editor In  Climate Panel Could Question Scope of Threat   front page  Feb  21   you report that the Trump administration intends to appoint a committee to investigate whether climate change  affects national security   The executive order creating the committee  casts doubt  on multiple government studies of climate change  noting that accepted climate science has not  undergone a rigorous independent and adversarial peer review  The government climate studies in question and dozens of similar studies have already been subjected to rigorous peer review  Perhaps the ultimate aim is to reset the standard for accepted scientific knowledge to that which is proved beyond the shadow of a doubt  with climate change deniers self empowered to act as the judge of whether that standard has been met For decades Republicans have treated science as an arena of partisan bickering rather than as a search for truth  The suggested change in the accepted system of peer review   adding the insidious requirement that it be  adversarial    would bring us one step closer to that future Stephen BurrowTeaneck  N J 
Michael R  White  the Navy veteran imprisoned in Iran since July  was beaten after his arrest  has no money to hire a lawyer and still does not know what charges   if any   have been filed against him  his mother said Monday Joanne White also said that her son  a former cancer patient  had been taken to a court at least twice and that his health was deteriorating A family spokesman  Jonathan Franks  said a GoFundMe page had been started to raise funds for Mr  White s legal representation in Iran Ms  White learned of her son s travails after diplomats from the Swiss Embassy in Tehran visited him on Feb  6 at the prison where he has been held  in the northeast city of Mashhad  The Swiss Embassy represents American interests in Iran It was the first time the Swiss had been able to see Mr  White since he was seized in Mashhad last July and taken to Vakilabad Prison  after having visited a person his family has described as an Iranian girlfriend  He has still not been able to communicate directly with his family Mr  White  47  of Imperial Beach  Calif   served in the Navy for 13 years  He is the first American to be incarcerated in Iran since President Trump took office in 2017  adding a complication to what already was a severely strained relationship between the United States and Iran He is one of at least four Americans known to be held in Iran  where the government has regarded the United States as its top enemy since the Islamic revolution that overthrew the shah 40 years ago  Over the past few weeks   Ms  White said   I ve learned that Mike was badly beaten when he was arrested and that he has been taken to court at least twice for proceedings in Farsi that he couldn t understand  My son is not well  His health is deteriorating  and I want him back so I can get him the care he badly needs  Alireza Miryousefi  a spokesman for Iran s United Nations Mission  confirmed in an email that the Swiss had met with Mr  White and that another meeting was planned in  coming days  Mr  Miryousefi also said that Iran s judiciary had provided medicine needed by Mr  White  despite increased prices caused by American sanctions  We can assuredly say that Mr  White is being treated humanely and in the best possible conditions given the criminal complaint against him   he said   We also hope  along with his family  that his case is speedily adjudicated by the judiciary that is in charge  Iranian officials have previously said Mr  White s imprisonment in Mashhad was a response to a complaint by an  individual plaintiff   whom they have not identified  They have also said he was under investigation for unspecified security charges Ms  White said she was compelled to resort to GoFundMe because her son had no money   Like most military families  it s hard for us to ask for help like this  but I am a widow on a fixed income   she said Mr  Franks  the family spokesman  said money raised would be transmitted to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran through the State Department for use in hiring an Iranian lawyer He said some of the funds might be disbursed  to purchase extra food for Mike and other items  and also to make it possible for him to contact the outside world if and when the restrictions on him doing so are removed  While the Trump administration has successfully extricated Americans held in North Korea  Egypt and   most recently   Yemen  there has been no obvious progress in securing the release of Americans known to be held in Iran They include Siamak and Baquer Namazi  an Iranian American father and son  and Xiyue Wang  a Chinese American graduate student at Princeton University  Another American  Robert Levinson  has been missing in Iran since 2007 Relatives of those Americans and of a Lebanese permanent resident of the United States  Nizar Zakka  who has been held in Iran since 2015  are scheduled to testify on Thursday before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in Washington 
On Wednesday  the Supreme Court once again took on a question that has long confounded it  What qualifies as an impermissible establishment of religion under the Constitution The court has over the years sent mixed signals about when the government may be playing favorites with a particular faith  For instance  in its ruling last year upholding President Trump s executive order imposing an entry ban on people from several Muslim majority countries  the Supreme Court insisted  in a 5 to 4 vote  that the restrictions were  facially neutral toward religion   ignoring the president s long history of antipathy toward Islam and its adherents  And weeks earlier  the justices ruled  in a narrow decision  for a Christian baker who had claimed mistreatment by Colorado s civil rights commission  which penalized him for denying service to a gay couple This week s hearing  in American Legion v  American Humanist Association  involved a 40 foot cross in Bladensburg  Md   that was erected 93 years ago to honor fallen World War I soldiers  The question before the court  Is Maryland in violation of the First Amendment because the memorial is on public property and maintained with public funds Over the years  the justices have tried to come up with rules to assess all kinds of religious emblems and practices carrying the government s imprimatur   sectarian prayers in legislative sessions  war memorials  Ten Commandments and Christmas displays  and mottos on seals or currency Lower court judges are confused about how to apply the Supreme Court s dictates in this area of the law  so more clarity from the high court   if not a definitive  bright line rule   is in order Alas  such clarity doesn t seem to be on the horizon  After Wednesday s hearing  the court seems poised to allow the cross   which otherwise bears no religious inscriptions   to stay  But the justices don t appear to be any closer to consensus on this issue than they ve ever been  I mean  it is the foremost symbol of Christianity  isn t it   Justice Elena Kagan asked at Wednesday s session   It invokes the central theological claim of Christianity  that Jesus Christ  the son of God  died on the cross for humanity s sins and that he rose from the dead  This is why Christians use crosses as a way to memorialize the dead  Justice Stephen Breyer  who in the past has wrestled with the Constitution s religion clauses  pondered whether  history counts  when assessing a monument s legality  Maybe older displays  erected when the nation wasn t nearly as religiously diverse  should be allowed  he suggested   We re a different country   Justice Breyer said   We are a different country now  and there are 50 more different religions  The Trump administration  which isn t a party in the case  has nonetheless weighed in  participating in oral arguments in support of the Maryland monument and other memorial crosses on federal property that could be similarly challenged  In the administration s view  the Maryland cross is secular in context and not an endorsement of any particular faith  and only displays that  coerce  religious belief or adherence ought to be considered unconstitutional  Taking offense at a passive display is not enough Arlington National Cemetery provides a good example of the kind of nondiscrimination the government should be aiming for  Federal rules allow for a wide array of religious and nonreligious symbols on headstones   That s the way this sort of thing is being handled today in a pluralistic society in which ordinary people   are not at each other s throats about religious divisions   Justice Samuel Alito said of Arlington on Wednesday That s fair enough  But with its recent rulings  the Supreme Court has only muddied the separation between church and state by taking seriously religious objections to contraception  civil rights laws and the allocation of public funds  It is hard to fathom the justices being nearly as accommodating with a publicly funded monument to atheism or a Wiccan pentagram  And last month  the court couldn t even agree that a Muslim death row prisoner from Alabama deserved the same rights as Christians in his final moments However the justices resolve this the dispute  they would be wise to not sow more confusion in this area of the law and feed the perception that only certain religions and practices get a fair shake in public life RelatedMore on the Supreme Court and religious freedomSupreme Court Seems Ready to Allow Cross Honoring War DeadFeb  27  2019Opinion   The Editorial BoardIs Religious Freedom for Christians Only Feb  9  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram 
To the Editor Re  What s Green  What s the Deal    editorial  Feb  24  Your excellent editorial lays out the contrast between the promise of a well crafted Green New Deal and the folly of doing nothing to address the central environmental challenge of our time From President Trump and Mitch McConnell on down  Republican leaders are running out of places to hide from their abject failure to protect our people from the rising costs and mounting dangers of climate change First  they said it was all a hoax  As the seas kept rising  the storms kept raging and the wildfires burned out of control  they threw up their hands and whined   We re not scientists   Now they ve got a new talking point  Trying to fight climate change  they say  is socialism  Socialism Nonsense  Pooling the best of American innovation and ideas to confront growing problems and gathering threats plays to our strengths as a democracy  as we ve proved time and again through successful initiatives from Social Security to Medicare Some Republicans seem hellbent on putting polluter profits first  even when it means putting the rest of us at risk  It s time to stand up and say we ve had enough  It s time for assertive and comprehensive action to protect our children from climate catastrophe   while we ve still got time Rhea SuhNew YorkThe writer is president of the Natural Resources Defense Council To the Editor The Green New Deal should be concerning to anyone who actually cares about climate change and supports a serious and urgent solution to the problem  This resolution uses climate change as leverage to push a clear and divisive social welfare agenda  The result is an overly expensive and incomplete solution to the climate crisis  Your editorial acknowledges these possibilities but hangs its hat on the premise that any climate change proposal is good for the cause  Let s stick to celebrating climate change resolutions that at least make an effort at unifying the country around ambitious but workable solutions Jon NevittScarsdale  N Y  To the Editor As young people  we are often told to calm down  to be patient  We have our whole lives ahead of us to figure things out  But when young people look to the future  we see a dark cloud  We see wildfires ravaging the West  We hear of record flooding and ever more powerful storms in the South  We feel the frigid cold brought to us by changing weather patterns  and we are scared In my classes  I study the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the last 70 years  which tells us to brace ourselves for climate conditions our species has never seen  That terrifies me  What keeps me optimistic  though  is the fact that people are working to understand how climate change will affect society and the ecosystems we depend on  But that work means nothing if our government does not pay attention to these findings and act That is why I am writing to voice my support for the Green New Deal  Climate change is a large problem to tackle  but we have to start somewhere  and the Green New Deal does just that  Colleen B  SchmidtNew YorkTo the Editor Re  Dianne Feinstein Lectures Children Who Want Green New Deal  Portraying It as Untenable   nytimes com  Feb  22  In her meeting with schoolchildren  Senator Dianne Feinstein demonstrated how not to approach the Green New Deal  especially with an audience of enthusiastic  idealistic youngsters whose future is at stake While I totally agree that the Green New Deal is not viable as currently formulated  I also believe that   especially with regard to climate change   it is a goal to strive toward  But if we are to avoid a tear within the Democratic Party  and a tear between generations  we must embrace both the goal and the obstacles What Ms  Feinstein should have said was that she will work toward that goal  recognizing both how important it is and how it will be feasible only in more manageable steps Let us not quash the idealism that is needed to make such major changes  But let us also not forget a quote attributed to Voltaire that  the best is the enemy of the good  Zvi J  DoronPittsburghThe writer is a retired nuclear engineer and co author of a book about energy and climate policies To the Editor While the children of the Sunrise Movement  who are working to stop climate change  may not understand how the Senate functions  they do correctly understand that if the world keeps functioning under business as usual rules  their lives will be fraught with one climate catastrophe after the next And it is not just children in states with Democratic senators who know this  Middle and high school students in Kentucky were out in force all week  even camping overnight in front of Mitch McConnell s Senate office for the chance to make their case  The Green New Deal may be expensive  but what would you pay to save your child s life  Multiply that by millions Helena BireckiSan FranciscoTo the Editor American history is replete with what seemed to be  at the time  overly ambitious public policies  Kennedy s pronouncement to put a man on the moon  The Eisenhower administration s Interstate highways  And  of course  Franklin D  Roosevelt s creation of Social Security The Green New Deal should be included in the debate over new public policies and receive scrutiny from experts to ensure that the proposals are judged on their merits Mark M  SpradleyChevy Chase  Md To the Editor  To Cut Emissions Faster  U S  Can Apply These Policies   news article  Feb  21  shamefully fails to include animal agriculture  which is the second leading source of greenhouse gas emissions  Not one of the seven steps to reduce emissions even mentions the problem  The article proposes a step to include electric car incentives  even though emissions from animal agriculture surpass those from the entire transportation sector   cars  trucks  trains  planes and ships combined We cannot continue to ignore the myriad problems with the meat economy  including its huge effect on carbon emissions John SanbonmatsuWorcester  Mass To the Editor Your editorial supporting the Green New Deal despite some of its unrealistic elements is right on the mark  The problem is that it might now be too late given the speed needed to overcome the extreme warming that has already occurred and the significant damage inflicted by the Trump administration on the Obama administration s environmental policies Historians might well focus on the 2016 campaign that resulted in the election of an unqualified climate denier as the death sentence to life on earth as we know it  They might also cast considerable blame on the mainstream media for its entertainment dominated coverage  which resulted in what you refer to as the  hard to believe  fact that not one question about climate change was asked in the presidential debates Mr  Trump proudly referred to climate change as a  hoax  despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary  If the debate moderators had repeatedly asked him for evidence to support this claim and the media had given as much time to this issue as to Hillary Clinton s emails  then perhaps the Obama climate policies would still be intact  some form of the Green New Deal would not appear so unrealistic  and we now might have a fighting chance to save life on earth as we know it Harold J  SmithWhite Plains
SANTIAGO  Chile   What will happen to Venezuela s opposition leader  and the movement he leads  when he returns to Venezuela That question has been asked across South America since Juan Guaidó left his country more than a week ago  defying a travel ban from Venezuela s courts to embark on a largely improvised tour of the continent to shore up support For his followers  the return can t come soon enough  as his continued absence raises questions about the momentum of the movement he began  I think it s confused the people because it s left us without a road map   it risks people losing faith in his project   said María Durán  who works at a nongovernmental organization in Caracas  the Venezuelan capital   There are people who ask  What happened  Originally  Mr  Guaidó had vowed to be back on Feb  23  planning to go in with a humanitarian aid shipment meant to pierce a military blockade of the borders set up by President Nicolás Maduro  But Mr  Maduro parried off the attempt with tear gas and rubber bullets  closing border bridges into Venezuela Then  the opposition floated the idea of a return after Mr  Guaidó met on Feb  25 with Vice President Mike Pence and other regional leaders in Bogotá  Colombia  Mr  Maduro responded with an interview with ABC News saying he could have Mr  Guaidó arrested for breaking the law Now  Mr  Guaidó has set a deadline of Monday morning for his return With each additional day that Mr  Guaidó spends outside the country  he further risks losing the unity of opposition parties  which have a long history of fracturing  said Geoff Ramsey  an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America ImagePresident Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela at a rally in support of his government in Caracas in February CreditReuters At this point  the opposition doesn t need another leader in exile   Mr  Ramsey said   The more time that Guaidó spends away from Caracas  the more the opposition becomes leaderless  Mr  Guaidó has spent most of the past week on a tour of the continent  with stops in Brazil  Paraguay  Argentina and Ecuador  These regional allies are among the 50 countries  including the United States  that have recognized him as president  not Mr  Maduro  who swore himself in in January for a second term after an election widely viewed as undemocratic Yet Mr  Guaidó remains a leader without a state  and any return to Venezuela could land him in prison  They may jail him   said Lawrence Castro  an opposition lawmaker from Mr  Guaidó s political party  who has himself stayed out of Venezuela until Mr  Guaidó returns   But we have to do everything we can to enter  The Trump administration has threatened repercussions for the Maduro government should Mr  Guaidó be jailed  But Mr  Maduro has challenged the United States already with his detentions  which included briefly holding the Mexican American journalist Jorge Ramos during a confrontational interview  The Maduro government has also detained Mr  Guaidó in the past and sent the police to his home Mr  Guaidó s international tour appears to be an effort to ensure that doesn t happen again  He s asking   If I go back and am arrested  then what will you do    said Alejandro Velasco  a historian of Venezuela at New York University The tour of regional capitals has also given the opposition time to regroup after a bruising loss over the aid shipment Mr  Guaidó had raised hopes among his supporters  who have suffered severe food shortages  with promises that an  aid avalanche  would flood the country with food and medicine   and turn Mr  Maduro s military against him  But armed gangs and soldiers loyal to the government easily blocked the aid  and supporters were reduced to throwing stones to express their anger ImageMr  Guaidó  center  with President Sebastián Piñera of Chile  far right  President Iván Duque of Colombia  second from right  and Luis Almagro  head of the Organization of American States  far left  in front of aid trucks in Colombia on Feb  23 CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesThe opposition faced further setbacks when it tried to escalate the dispute  calling for a military intervention by Venezuela s neighbors to oust Mr  Maduro  In a meeting last Monday in Bogotá  most leaders attending rebuffed the call  The Trump administration has ruled out using the military to force aid into the country With Mr  Maduro firmly controlling the borders  and defections from his military so far numbering only in the hundreds  the opposition is being forced to accept that the government s rule appears to be more durable than Mr  Guaidó had painted it Ricardo Reyes  a journalist in Caracas  said that in Venezuela that message had been sinking in   A transition process isn t easy and sometimes drags on more than you thought  especially when your Plan A didn t work out   he said Given Mr  Maduro s continued hold  the international community is considering compromises On Wednesday  the secretary general of the Organization of American States  Luis Almagro  who is one of Mr  Guaidó s chief international supporters  said he would not object to Mr  Maduro s running for office again if a new election was free and fair  Mr  Almagro had previously joined hard liners in demanding that the president step down On his stops abroad  Mr  Guaidó has been greeted as a head of state  a contrast to his secretive  undercover departure from Venezuela to defy a travel ban His trip began in Brazil  where he met the new president  Jair Bolsonaro  a right wing populist who has referred to leftists there as  red outlaws  and threatened to drive them out  Mr  Guaidó also met with Lenín Moreno  Ecuador s center left president  to show that he has support on both sides of the political divide In Argentina  Mr  Guaidó was greeted by large crowds of Venezuelans  many of whom had fled the economic crisis over which Mr  Maduro has presided  There is no turning back   Mr  Guaidó told a crowd gathered at a square in Buenos Aires   The only turning back we will do is when we go back home  And I promise you that will be soon  
A New Zealand native who joined the Islamic State should not lose his citizenship but may face charges if he returns home  the country s prime minister said on Monday  outlining a milder approach than Britain and the United States have taken toward citizens with ties to the group The New Zealander  Mark Taylor  was widely ridiculed when he forgot to turn off Twitter s location tagging function in 2014  and inadvertently gave away the positions of Islamic State fighters in Syria On Monday  the ABC  Australia s public broadcaster  quoted Mr  Taylor as saying that he had fled the Islamic State in December and surrendered to Kurdish forces because living with the terrorist group had become too difficult  The ABC said he was being held in a Kurdish prison Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters on Monday that New Zealand had plans in place for any Islamic State fighters who try to return  Mr  Taylor only holds New Zealand citizenship  and the government has an obligation not to make people stateless   she said  adding that Mr  Taylor was among a small number of New Zealanders who had joined the Islamic State   She declined to say precisely how many  Ms  Ardern said that joining the group was illegal and that Mr  Taylor  who officials say does not appear to have a valid passport or travel documents  could face charges if he returns to New Zealand  To return  he would first have to travel to a country where New Zealand has a diplomatic presence and request an emergency travel document  she said Britain and the United States have recently taken a harsher line on citizens trying to return after stints with the Islamic State President Trump has said the United States will not readmit Hoda Muthana  an American born woman who traveled to Syria to join the group and now wants to come home  His administration has also signaled that former Islamic State fighters could be sent to the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay  Cuba Britain s home secretary  Sajid Javid  who is in charge of citizenship and immigration  has rebuffed pleas to return from Shamima Begum  a 19 year old woman who traveled to Syria four years ago to marry an Islamic State fighter Ms  Begum has asked to return for the sake of her newborn son  and British law prevents the government from stripping someone s citizenship if doing so would render the person stateless  But British news outlets have reported that the Home Office decided it could revoke Ms  Begum s citizenship because her mother has a passport from Bangladesh  which would typically qualify the daughter for citizenship there The Home Office said last month that while it could not comment on individual cases  Mr  Javid has the power to deprive a British national of his or her citizenship  in order to protect this country   so long as doing so does not render the person stateless Mr  Taylor  the New Zealander   who is known by his Twitter alias   Kiwi Jihadi    traveled to Syria in 2014  He told the ABC that he had worked as a guard on the border between territory controlled by the Islamic State and the Syrian government  There s a difference between fighting and guarding   he said   Guarding  you don t need to plan anything  attacking  you need to make preparations  Mr  Taylor appeared in an Islamic State promotional video that called for attacks on celebrations in Australia and New Zealand for Anzac Day  a holiday that commemorates those countries  citizens who died in overseas wars  He told the ABC that he had witnessed several beheadings and executions during his time with the group He also said he that expected New Zealand to eventually take him back  but that he would probably need to spend  a couple of years  in prison  I m sorry for causing too much trouble and being a bit hotheaded and flamboyant in my approach   said Mr  Taylor  who also goes by the names Muhammad Daniel and Abu Abdul Rahman Mr  Taylor said that he regretted not being able to afford a female slave from the Yazidi ethnic minority Islamic State fighters enslaved  raped and killed thousands of Yazidis after storming their communities in Iraq s Sinjar region in 2014  The systematic rape of Yazidi women and girls eventually became deeply enmeshed in the group s radical theology 
While he was the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida in 2007  Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta oversaw a plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein  the New York financier accused of sexually abusing more than 80 underage girls  Rich and well connected   his friends and acquaintances included Prince Andrew  Bill Clinton  Kevin Spacey  Woody Allen and Donald Trump   Mr  Epstein faced a 53 page federal indictment that could have put him in prison for life  according to The Miami Herald  which ran a blockbuster expose in November  The F B I  was also investigating him on suspicion of masterminding an international sex trafficking operation But Mr  Acosta s office  working closely with Mr  Epstein s high priced defense team   stocked with legal stars such as Alan Dershowitz  Kenneth Starr  Jay Lefkowitz and Roy Black   put together a non prosecution agreement that let Mr  Epstein avoid federal charges  plead guilty to two state counts of felony prostitution  and serve less than 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach County jail  with most days spent on work release in his office in West Palm Beach  Mr  Epstein was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to some of the young women  but the agreement shut down the F B I  investigation and gave immunity to all  potential co conspirators    including any of Mr  Epstein s rich and powerful buddies who may have taken a turn with his victims  It was a deal so sweet it would rot your teeth  It also turned out to be illegal Last Thursday  after a decade long court battle begun by two of Mr  Epstein s accusers  a federal judge ruled that Mr  Acosta and his team violated the federal Crime Victims  Rights Act by hiding the details of Mr  Epstein s deal from his victims   many of whom didn t know a deal had been in the works until they heard about it on the news  This denied the young women an opportunity to appear at Mr  Epstein s sentencing hearing  The victims were also led to believe that the F B I  investigation would continue  It was a betrayal of countless young women   the full tally of Mr  Epstein s victims remains unknown   who d already had their bodies violated and their innocence destroyed If even a fraction of the accusations against him are true  Mr  Epstein was no ordinary predator   Those with a weak stomach may want to skip ahead   For years  he allegedly turned his Palm Beach mansion into a sex den  luring in teenagers whom he paid and coerced into an array of sexual behavior  Mr  Epstein reportedly groomed some of the teenagers to recruit even younger  fresher victims  He was said to like his girls white and prepubescent looking  One victim has recalled that Mr  Epstein praised her as  pure    she was 14 at the time   before molesting her  Like many predators  he preferred his victims troubled  making them easier to manipulate and less likely to be believed if they reported him Mr  Epstein reportedly had victims brought in up to three times a day  some from out of state  others from out of the country  More grotesque still  he was suspected of loaning girls out to his friends  hosting sex parties at his homes in the Caribbean  Manhattan  and New Mexico  In New York  a lawsuit is pending that accuses Mr  Epstein of employing a modeling agency to import girls as young as 13 from Europe and South America In response to The Herald s expose  congressional lawmakers urged the Department of Justice to look into federal prosecutors  handling of Mr  Epstein s case  The Office of Professional Responsibility opened a misconduct investigation last month  Its findings will be reported back to lawmakers In last week s ruling  Judge Kenneth Marra noted that the Crime Victims  Rights Act  authorizes the rescission or  reopening  of a prosecutorial agreement  including a non prosecution agreement  reached in violation of a prosecutor s conferral obligations under the statute   Senator Ben Sasse  Republican of Nebraska  is agitating for such action   Jeffrey Epstein is a monster  and his victims deserve justice   the senator has charged  calling on the Justice Department to  reopen its non prosecution agreement so that Epstein and anyone else who abused these children are held accountable  Accountability would be a refreshing change in this horror story  While Mr  Acosta was coddling a credibly accused monster  Mr  Epstein s victims were being misled and stripped of their rights by the very people whose job it was to deliver them justice  In a 2011 letter to the media  Mr  Acosta defensively whined that he d faced  a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors  from Mr  Epstein s intimidating legal team  His capitulation suggests he lacks the spine and moral decency to continue as labor secretary During his 2017 confirmation hearings  Mr  Acosta brushed back questions about Mr  Epstein  insisting that he had done his best  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  opposed his nomination  contending that Mr  Acosta s handling of the case   suggests he won t put the interests of workers and everyday people ahead of the powerful and well connected  Ms  Feinstein was being generous  The Epstein case shows that under Mr  Acosta  the rich and powerful got away with the most vile offenses  Both Congress and the administration must demand answers  both for Mr  Epstein s victims and the American public  RelatedLabor Secretary Faces Heat Over Plea Deal for Financier Accused of Serial Sex AbuseFeb  25  2019Opinion   Michelle GoldbergWhy Does Alex

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  Recently Mayor Bill de Blasio went to Iowa  not for the first time  presumably to vision board a bid for the presidency despite his public equivocations  Over the course of two stops  one in Sioux City and another in Des Moines  roughly 65 people came out to see him  a number that might disappoint even organizers of a municipal town hall on new concepts in recycling  Never one to be deterred by absurdly long odds  he is on his way to Florida this weekend Let s take it as a matter of certainty that with a 43 percent approval rating in the city he runs and no reality television franchise to explode his fan base  Mr  de Blasio has little chance of becoming the next president of the United States  Delusion often protects us from acknowledging life s unsettling ironies  Six years ago  when he was elected the mayor of New York  in a landslide of the kind not seen since 1985  he was poised to become the country s most prominent voice of the progressive left It is easy to forget how concisely he delivered his message on the corrosive effects of inequality and how much it resonated when he campaigned in 2013  a moment when few politicians of his stature were branding themselves so definitively this way And yet by the time of the Democratic National Convention in 2016  Mr  de Blasio was relegated to a minor speaking slot scheduled during rush hour on the East Coast  This was partly retribution for his slow reflex to endorse the Democratic nominee  but it made clear how little currency he actually had with a new and growing movement he was so crucial in fomenting Now  even if he were to serve merely as a traveling salesman for a particular strain of liberal problem solving  something he seems compelled to do  Mr  de Blasio could easily be a liability to Democrats in the 2020 election cycle On the one hand  a new wave of progressives shares little of his comfort with real estate and other moneyed interests  This was clear when his initial support of Amazon s expansion in New York was met with a fury he did not anticipate  He could not see that his relentless focus on the 25 000 jobs Amazon promised was misguided given low unemployment rates and the increasing number of technology jobs that have already come to New York  Good jobs are available to New Yorkers  what they don t have is affordable housing  and that is a problem Amazon wasn t going to solve Beyond that  the mayor is especially vulnerable to attacks from the right that would  predictably  suggest that his administration has embodied the failure of so called big government  It is hard to defend his disastrous handling of the New York City Housing Authority  which has been troubled and underfunded for decades but reached peak crisis during his tenure  with lies and obfuscations about lead paint inspections and the increasing debilitation of the buildings themselves Just this week at a panel discussion on the future of Brooklyn  the urban planner and Yale professor Alexander Garvin  who oversaw the development of Lower Manhattan after the attacks of Sept  11  argued that the city has passively and pointlessly waited for federal money to repair public housing   money that was never going to come   instead of pursuing innovative means of financing those repairs itself  through bond issues The troubled subway system and Mr  de Blasio s unsuccessful Renewal schools initiative simply provide more bait for privatization hawks to discredit the viability of a liberal approach to accomplishing fundamental problems with infrastructure and education that plague the whole country While blame for the dysfunctional transit system can largely be laid at the feet of Gov  Andrew Cuomo  the mayor s inability to work with him as a grown up has only made things worse  It took Mr  de Blasio until the last possible minute to get behind a congestion pricing plan that could divert revenue to subway repairs The mayor is increasingly oblivious  This week he rode the subway and seemed surprised to discover just how exasperated New Yorkers are with their inability to get to where they are going without delays and hassles and endless anxiety  What I gleaned is people really depend on their subways   Mr  de Blasio said at a news conference later  sounding as if he were a tourist from Havana with limited access to the tens of thousands of words that have been devoted to this subject by the local press during the past few years   Some days I get to work on time  some days I m a half hour late  45 minutes late    Mr  de Blasio continued  recounting the conversations he had on the train   You can hear the frustration   That frustration has been within audible range for a very long time Mr  de Blasio s style seems particularly ill suited to a moment when personality politics have entered a new and hypercharged phase  when the ability to create an obsession both among one s own constituents and the opposition seems so essential to getting ahead  Mr  de Blasio has always dismissed the criticisms that he is too earnest  too arrogant  too unlikable  too aloof  But how does he plan to compete in a world of Donald Trump rage tweets and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez talking to voters as she sings in her kitchen or chops squash Somewhere he may have the knives to cut through  but they all lack the edge 
BEIJING   China is poised to approve a sweeping rewrite of the country s laws on foreign investment that it hopes will help pacify the United States and ease a rancorous trade dispute  The new rules would respond to some concerns among foreign governments and businesses but disregard many other worries China has been locked in a bruising struggle with the United States over the Trump administration s contentions that Beijing has repeatedly forced foreign companies to hand over technological secrets as a condition of doing business in China  and has failed to protect American companies  products from counterfeiting and other illegal copying  Beijing has denied any shortcomings in its existing practices  and the new law does call for tighter enforcement But the new law is made up of many single sentence pronouncements on complex issues  with no details on how those rules would be carried out  This is good  but it s not enough   said Carlo Diego D Andrea  the chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in China There are some signs that a settlement of the trade war may be coming soon  Still  the new foreign investment law  if passed  would bar local and provincial officials from requiring that foreign companies transfer technology to Chinese companies The most recent published draft  issued in late December  made no mention of preventing national government regulators from demanding technology transfers The National People s Congress said on Monday that it will debate the draft law on Friday and vote on it a week later at the close of the session  Approval is essentially automatic in the 2 975 member congress  which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party  although there is some room for last minute amendments  The congress s 11 day annual session opens on Tuesday Zhang Yesui  the spokesman for the congress  said the law would  improve the openness  transparency and predictability of the investment environment  and provide more effective legal protection for the formation of a new  open system  Chinese experts say the legislation would be a big improvement over the current environment in which foreign investment is regulated by three separate laws Foreign experts are less sure  The European Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement last week that the language used in the law was overly broad The 2015 draft of the same law  which the legislature never approved  had 170 articles  But the final draft released for public comment in late December had just 39 articles  a third of which are a single sentence each ImageZhang Yesui  right  a National People s Congress spokesman  said the new law would  provide more effective legal protection for the formation of a new  open system  CreditNg Han Guan Associated PressOver the last several years  as Chinese officials mused publicly about the possibility of a new law  there were some calls from foreign and domestic businesses for the laws on foreign investment to be merged with the laws for Chinese investors Foreign businesses contended that they should be allowed to compete based on the same rules as local businesses  Some Chinese businesses also favored merging the domestic and foreign investment laws in the hope that they would be given more protection  For example  the draft foreign investment law requires that companies be fairly compensated if their assets are seized by the state   a rule that might benefit Chinese companies if they were in a similar situation The European Chamber criticized the government for retaining separate rules for foreign investors  And Ker Gibbs  the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai  said that  foreign businesses should receive equal treatment and only be restricted from investing in areas that truly impact national security interests  Western business groups are also particularly concerned that the law would require foreign companies to share detailed information about their operations under a new reporting system  That system would be used to keep score of how well foreign companies  subsidiaries complied with local and national regulations  including areas like pollution  head count and labor disputes Business groups wanted the law to include a ban on the sharing of information from the reporting system with Chinese competitors  But the most recently released draft does not include such a provision Foreign business groups and business leaders have also been caught off guard by the way that China has fast tracked the process of reviewing the new law In China  draft laws often go through reviews that take several years  In this case  the law looked set to be voted on less than three months after being introduced  although a different  more comprehensive draft had been circulated by China s Commerce Ministry in 2015 The standing committee of the legislature held an initial review of the new law on Dec  26 and then issued the draft for public comment  It then held a second review at the end of January  just before the start of Chinese New Year celebrations and nearly a month before the deadline for public comments Many foreign executives were out of town on vacation during both reviews  so there has been little discussion of the new law s impact  The European Union criticized the government for moving faster on the legislation than China s own rules for public comment normally allow The draft law would establish a complaints procedure for foreign companies  But it indicates that such cases may be heard in Chinese courts  which are under the tight control of the Communist Party  Many judges in China have limited legal training and are chosen for political loyalty James Zimmerman  a partner in the Beijing office of the Perkins Coie law firm  said that if the final version of the legislation next week called for cases to be heard in Chinese courts  practically no Western businesses would want to use the process Western companies have been afraid of antagonizing Chinese regulators  who have broad powers to retaliate  They have also been reluctant even to tell their home countries  international trade offices about cases in which they believe Beijing is violating its commitments to the World Trade Organization So it is far from clear that they will start suing the Chinese government in its own courts  Why would someone want to involve themselves in a politically driven process like that   Mr  Zimmerman asked 
Democrats and Republicans are working together to help poor people get training for better jobs  That might seem hard to believe these days  but it s true The Jobs Act  introduced by Senator Tim Kaine  Democrat of Virginia  and Senator Rob Portman  Republican of Ohio  attracted 12 bipartisan co sponsors  including three Democrats who are running for president  Similar legislation was introduced in the House  It could very well become law Unfortunately  a raft of research suggests this well meaning bill may actually hurt the students it is designed to help Currently  low income students can use Pell grants to pay for bachelor s degrees  associate s degrees and shorter certificate programs that last at least 15 weeks  The Jobs Act would drop the minimum to eight weeks for any  job training program  offered by an accredited college  Eligible students would receive up to about  3 000   half a Pell grant   to pay tuition The intent is to modernize the college financial aid system to help students get jobs quickly   We ve perpetrated a myth that post high school has to be college   Mr  Kaine  the son of an iron worker and welder  said at a Senate Education Committee hearing   There are all kinds of career and technical programs where there is significant need in the work force  Mr  Kaine and Mr  Portman promised they would allow the abridged Pell grants to support only  high quality and rigorous  programs  But the bill doesn t have an effective mechanism for ensuring quality  As written  it could touch off a new wave of exploitation by the same for profit colleges that have already wasted billions of taxpayer dollars and left some vulnerable students with mountains of debt When it comes to quality  the existing Pell grant system largely lets colleges police themselves  There is no accountability for whether students get jobs after they graduate or how much they earn  That s less of a problem for bachelor s degree programs because there is much evidence on the long term economic benefit of a B A   especially for low income students  Even much maligned liberal arts degrees tend to pay off in the end Short term training programs have only one purpose  If they don t lead to better jobs and wages  they have failed  And study after study finds that too many such programs are  in fact  failing The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that while certificate programs increase earnings on average   there are many certificates   especially in fields of study with high concentrations of women   that do not confer a substantial wage premium over a high school degree  Who offers these failing programs  Often  for profit colleges that enroll large numbers of students  An analysis from the left leaning Center for American Progress found that  of the 15 certificate programs with the most graduates  10 have typical earnings of  18 000 or less  for students two to four years after they leave school   This includes the two largest program types   medical assisting and cosmetology   which have typical earnings of  15 309 and  12 272  respectively   In many states  cosmetology is dominated by for profit schools  The same is true for medical assisting  with duties like checking vital signs and scheduling appointments   And these dismal results are for programs that last at least 15 weeks  Smaller programs could be even less effective In addition to shortchanging women  the limitations of short term certificates are also stratified by race  Georgetown researchers found that one in six African Americans report their highest level of education as a certificate  compared with one in nine among Hispanic  Asian  and white Americans  Yet African Americans get the smallest earnings boost for their short term credentials Nothing in the Jobs Act would change these dynamics  The bill says job training programs must  meet the hiring requirements of potential employers   But it allows individual colleges  including for profits  to decide whether their own programs qualify  That laissez faire approach to regulation recently led to widespread fraud and abuse  saddling hundreds of thousands of students with bad loans In response  the Obama administration cracked down on the for profit industry  The Trump administration is in the process of dismantling the Obama rules Columbia University researchers have found that the positive benefits of short term certificates  may fade out within a few years post college   The benefits of longer term credentials  by contrast  persist  Yet only about one in four students whose first credential is a short term certificate go on to earn an associate s or bachelor s degree within six years  For those over 24  it s closer to one in five There are other ways to lift workers who need better jobs  Services like career advising and job search assistance have been shown to help  On the job learning can also be effective  But the Jobs Act doesn t fund such assistance  because the Pell grant program wasn t designed to fund job training  Instead  the bill leaves students at the mercy of a higher education market that routinely fails them  The students buy training that  especially for women and students of color  often doesn t work All of these issues are likely to play out on a larger stage as Democrats vying for the presidency propose large new federal investments in higher learning  and Congress begins the once a decade task of reauthorizing the federal Higher Education Act It s appealing to think that for just  3 000  and just eight weeks  students could get enough training to begin better careers  That s probably why so many politicians from both sides of the aisle have signed onto the Jobs Act  But short training programs of wildly uneven quality are already contributing to a growing wealth gap along race and gender lines  Making them even shorter could make that disparity even worse Kevin Carey directs the education policy

DOHA  Qatar   American negotiators and Taliban officials set to resume negotiations in the Qatari capital on Saturday expressed guarded optimism that they are getting closer to an agreement that could help end 17 years of conflict  America s longest war During a two day break from direct negotiations at a holiday resort in Doha  a series of small meetings continued around town to bridge the gap on core issues  such as withdrawal of American troops and prohibiting international terror groups from using Afghan soil  according to several current and former officials from all sides involved in the talks  There is progress   Sohail Shaheen  a spokesman for the Taliban s negotiating team  said in an interview on Friday   The technical groups are working on the details of a draft agreement about troop pullout from Afghanistan  and also that Afghanistan s soil must not be a haven for anyone to use it against other countries  We have moved the agreement forward  but we have not completed it  But a host of complications remain  including the continued violence  as neither side has given up making attacks  Even as negotiators were sounding hopeful in Doha  Taliban fighters assaulted a large Afghan Army base in Helmand Province where United States Marines are present  killing at least two dozen Afghan soldiers Nevertheless  officials on both sides described a growing rapport between Zalmay Khalilzad  the American special envoy leading the negotiations  and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar  the Taliban s deputy leader  who is for the first time taking a more direct role in negotiations Mullah Baradar met twice with Mr  Khalilzad and Gen  Austin S  Miller  the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan  joined by Qatar s foreign minister in the second of those meetings ImageAmerican envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said   We continue to take slow  steady steps toward understanding and eventually peace  CreditJim Huylebroek for The New York TimesIn the two full days of negotiations before the sides took a break  the main negotiating teams  led by Mr  Khalilzad for the United States and Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai for the Taliban  were supported by technical teams in side rooms off the conference hall  In the Taliban s technical room  many delegation members scribbled in notebooks  while one had a single MacBook at the table  Mullah Baradar occasionally came in to the technical room to consult  We continue to take slow  steady steps toward understanding and eventually peace   Mr  Khalilzad said Other conflicts in the region  however  are complicating the peace effort  Enmity between Qatar and Saudi Arabia has been an issue hanging over the direct talks since they started late last year  And the conflict in recent days between Pakistan and India over Kashmir has also injected uncertainty  officials said There is also a large gap between the American and Taliban delegations over the Americans  insistence that the Taliban agree to talk with the Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani about the political future of the country before any troop withdrawal can be finalized The Taliban have refused  angering Mr  Ghani  who has repeatedly expressed concern that the current talks  bypassing of his administration is further destabilizing the already fragile Afghan state  Mr  Ghani s government was excluded from talks between Afghan political opposition leaders and the Taliban in Moscow last month Officials here said that part of the smaller sessions over the past two days have focused on what it would take to reach a cease fire   another core American demand on the Taliban  Some officials said that one thing being discussed is whether to start with region specific cease fires   rather than a nationwide truce   that would coincide with an American troop pullout in those regions Officials suggested that even on the issue of future talks that could include the Afghan government there were hopeful signs  One possibility floated for reaching a compromise is that an Afghan negotiating team including government officials and other political leaders would come to Doha as part of a bigger group of Afghans  It remains to be seen how acceptable that is to President Ghani ImageThe Taliban have so far refused to meet with the Afghan government  angering Afghan President Ashraf Ghani CreditMohammad Ismail ReutersMr  Shaheen  the Taliban delegation s spokesman  said the insurgents  position remained the same  They will continue speaking to Afghans  such as the gathering in Moscow  but not negotiate with Mr  Ghani s representatives if  they are participating as a government   There are two different aspects   one is with the Americans  Once that is finalized  then we will come to the internal side   Mr  Shaheen said   If we recognize it as a government  there is no justification for fighting  Adding to the complexity are the conflicts between other nations in the broader region Qatar  the host of the talks  is isolated by a blockade against it by Saudi Arabia and its gulf allies  A recent Saudi push to become part of American peace efforts frustrated the Qataris  who had long hosted the Taliban at the request of the Americans during the Obama administration But Mr  Khalizad  entrusted last year by the Trump administration to move urgently to engage the Taliban in talks  had his doubts about just how authoritative the Taliban representatives in Doha were  according to two senior officials who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations  So Mr  Khalizad also engaged Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in his efforts  Both countries are influential with Pakistan  where the Taliban s most senior leaders still have sanctuary But that effort angered Qatari officials  And the regional rivalries also became too much for the Taliban  which for the most part preferred to work through its office in Qatar on a smaller negotiating agenda Another conflict has been the flare up between Pakistan and India As the two nuclear states shot at each other across the border and conducted airstrikes in recent days  the foreign minister of Pakistan came out to remind the Americans that any chaos between India and Pakistan could affect the Taliban talks  The regional dimension has to be handled in a way that builds support among the regional actors without importing their separate conflicts into Afghanistan   said Laurel Miller  a former senior American diplomat now leading the Asia program at the International Crisis Group 
Nobody knows for sure who the real president of Venezuela is at the moment  Nicolás Maduro  who was sworn in on Jan  10  or Juan Guaidó  who shortly afterward assumed the powers of the presidency  on behalf of the legislature Mr  Guaidó has captured the heart of the nation  A vast majority of Venezuelans support him  All political parties in Venezuela other than the ruling party accept his legal argument   that Mr  Maduro s 2018 re election was fraudulent  He returned to his homeland today   once again challenging a travel ban imposed on him by Maduro s regime   after touring five Latin American countries to shore up support for democracy in Venezuela Mr  Maduro has the heart of only one institution  the military  This was evidenced on Feb  23  when he used brute military force to successfully block the entry of humanitarian aid  killing civilians  and in Nero like fashion  set some delivery trucks on fire  while he danced salsa on national television The question is how to confront Mr  Maduro s military assault without turning to military action  This is Venezuela s predicament  As a peaceful resolution appears increasingly unlikely  Mr  Guaidó has called on the opposition allies to mediate or intervene Most analysts  including me  agree that foreign intervention is too risky  The logistics are too complicated  and the enterprise would put the duplicitous Trump administration in the driver s seat  which would calm no one s nerves However  a few alternatives exist short of militarizing the conflict  even though they still would involve some degree of militarization  To understand this  we must first understand how Mr  Maduro s military operates In every authoritarian regime  military support is the sine qua non of regime survival  Remove the support of the military and the dictator falls  In that sense  the Maduro regime fits the conventional model of authoritarian politics  Democratization requires decoupling the military from Maduro But the politics of decoupling the military from Maduro has proved complicated because Mr  Maduro s military alliance  in many respects  is more unconventional than not  His military is not a single  professional  vertical organization  It comprises multiple elements  each with its own interest in supporting the regime  A strategy to divorce it from Mr  Maduro requires deploying policies to address each of those groups There s the standard military establishment  which in Venezuela consists of professional career soldiers  Then there are nonstandard groups  They include ideologized soldiers  working together with Cuban military and intelligence officials to crack down on dissent  They also include bureaucrat generals who support Mr  Maduro because they have good jobs running state owned corporations  and profit seeking soldiers  who are making a fortune trafficking in illicit markets  including the drug trade  Finally  there are Maduro s killing agents  in charge of repressing Before the 2000s  the possibility of this type of diversity within the military was hardly discussed in military politics textbooks  Today  this diversity  or what political scientists are calling the new oligopoly of state violence  is what undemocratic regimes and failed states prefer  And in Venezuela  this oligopoly is dominated by the criminal minded soldiers and killing agents Killing agents in particular have become the hallmark of Mr  Maduro s rule  They comprise two groups  the Special Actions Forces  or FAES  created in 2017 to combat crime but in reality charged with conducting politically motivated killings in poor neighborhoods  and the so called colectivos  armed civilians paid by the government  In the early 2000s  colectivos were community organized reservists  Today they consist mostly of delinquents  thugs and even former inmates  They show up on motorcycles at protests  gun in hand and with their faces covered  to terrorize participants  Colectivos spare professional soldiers from the need to repress The problem with Mr  Guaidó s strategy   in fact  any peaceful and democratic strategy to demilitarize a regime   is that it cannot easily address the concerns of these disparate military groups Some can be addressed with policies already offered by the interim president  For instance  Mr  Guaidó s offer of transitional justice  amnesty  with fair elections has enormous appeal to scared soldiers and many professional soldiers  This is why we are seeing defections by many of these soldiers But there is little in Mr  Guaidó s policies that would appeal to hard core ideologues  for profit and criminal soldiers  and colectivos  Hard core ideologues are likely to stand with Mr  Maduro unconditionally  The for profit generals will gain little from transitional justice  They will be left without status and profits even if their transgressions are forgiven  And the colectivos are especially hard to deal with because they are the least controllable group   they are too decentralized and have no corporate interest to defend Transitioning to democracy in Venezuela will require putting order to this fragmented military  The darkest groups within this institution cannot be invited to join a democratic movement   that would produce an instant conflict of interest  Instead  these groups need to be neutralized somehow A civilian alone cannot do it  Only actors from within the military establishment   those who know the identities of the armed actors within their ranks  their businesses and deals   can do the revamping of the military that is needed Mr  Guaidó and his international allies may have no option but to entertain an interim civilian military partnership under some form of international tutelage  They need to continue to reach out to some of the more honest military officers  those interested in the integrity of the institution  to turn against not just Mr  Maduro but also the disparate groups across the military  The mission  Bring the military institution back to order This will of course require applying a combination of force and some concessions to the least professional groups within the military  Smart witness protection programs along with an expansion of amnesty provisions will need to be offered  Economic opportunities will need to be found for both profit seeking soldiers and colectivos The transition to democracy  given the fragmented and dark nature of Venezuela s military  will therefore never be a clean  overnight transition from military rule to civilian rule  It will require a transition period that no doubt will be unpleasant for Venezuelan democrats  But it is better than the war based stalemate that the country is in or the United States led intervention that many are increasingly calling for  RelatedMore from Opinion on Venezuela Opinion   Juan GuaidóJuan Guaidó  Venezuelans  Strength Is in UnityJan  30  2019Opinion   Michael ShifterCan Venezuela Have a

Good morning  If you don t already get California Today emailed to you  here s the sign up  Over the weekend  District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert announced that the Sacramento police officers who killed Stephon Clark would not face criminal charges Mr  Clark  a 22 year old  unarmed black man  was shot last year in his grandmother s backyard  Police officers fired their weapons 20 times in Mr  Clark s direction within seconds of turning a blind corner  A Times analysis of video of the shooting found that the gunfire continued after Mr  Clark had fallen to his hands and knees  Was a crime committed  There s no question that a human being died   Ms  Schubert said on Saturday in Sacramento   But when we look at the facts and the law  and we follow our ethical responsibilities  the answer to that question is no  The announcement led to a new round of protests in the city  as well as renewed calls for justice from Mr  Clark s family  including from his brother  Stevante Clark  I would like for the attorney general to prosecute the officers   Mr  Clark said at a news conference   I want justice and accountability  Attorney General Xavier Becerra is expected to release the results of his own investigation into the shooting soon and has previously said his office has the authority to bring charges  regardless of Ms  Schubert s decision  according to The Sacramento Bee Mr  Becerra s office has recently been involved in a range of high profile issues He s positioned his office at the forefront of California s resistance against President Trump s policies  suing the administration more than 45 times And the tenure of his predecessor  Senator Kamala Harris  has been scrutinized as she runs for president It s a big job   and a clear launchpad for leaders with big political ambitions   Ms  Harris s predecessor  Jerry Brown  But what are the limits of the attorney general s power  And does the office have a core mandate I asked David A  Carrillo  executive director of U C  Berkeley s California Constitution Center  about the job Essentially  he said  its charge is very broad  The office has a wide array of responsibilities under two broad categories  acting as the state s lawyer  and as its highest law enforcement official   Mr  Carrillo said in an email  The latter gives the attorney general some power over local prosecutors  sheriffs and police chiefs While he wouldn t comment on any specific attorney general  Mr  Carrillo said that breadth of responsibility means whoever s in the role sets his or her own legal priorities during the term In the case of PG E s bankruptcy  for instance  the attorney general has the power to file lawsuits or intervene in existing actions  including appearing on California s behalf in a federal bankruptcy proceeding  Mr  Carrillo said If the attorney general believes it s necessary  they can also take on any criminal investigations  refer matters to county prosecutors or convene a grand jury to consider any criminal matters  In the event of a conflict of interest  the attorney general could employ a special counsel to handle a prosecution Finally  Mr  Carrillo said  the sheer volume of issues the attorney general s office deals with means that while battles with the federal government might be more attention grabbing  they re actually a sliver of the office s caseload  In fact  he said  it was recently estimated that federal cases absorb about 1 percent of the departmental budget Nevertheless  Mr  Carrillo said it s important for states to occasionally push back against the federal government  These conflicts happen frequently  across the nation  regardless of the party in power or era   he said   States should advance their citizens  interests  and doing so is essential to maintaining the balance of power between the states and the federal government  Here s what else we re following today We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers  We appreciate your reading Times

The new AT T is coming into focus On Monday the company took a step closer to becoming something never before seen on the American corporate landscape   part telecommunications behemoth and part media entertainment giant The transformation started in earnest last June when AT T  based in Dallas  ventured beyond its core business and muscled into New York and Los Angeles with its  85 4 billion acquisition of Time Warner  the former home of HBO  the Warner Bros  movie studio  CNN and cable channels like TBS and TNT  Last week  the deal was set in stone when the Justice Department  after losing a hard fought appeal to block it  said it would no longer try to undo the merger With this final green light  AT T has in recent days altered its leadership team with an eye toward reinvention On Monday  the company named Robert Greenblatt  the former head of entertainment at NBC and Showtime  as the new chairman at Warner Media  a job that will give him oversight of Time Warner properties like HBO  TBS and TNT  His hiring followed the resignations of Richard Plepler  the longtime chief executive of HBO  and David Levy  the president of Turner Broadcasting  the division that includes TBS and TNT As part of its executive shake up  AT T   which gained 26 000 employees in the merger  giving it 268 000 worldwide   also promoted the CNN chief Jeff Zucker and the Warner Bros  studio head Kevin Tsujihara  both of whom will oversee bigger portfolios John Stankey  an AT T veteran who was put in charge of Warner Media at the time of the acquisition  is the executive behind the moves  which show that the company is serious about tearing up old ways and putting its own stamp on its new properties  The company s two core businesses are both facing upheaval as tech companies like Amazon  Netflix  Apple  Google and Facebook have become dominant players in both entertainment and distribution  If you don t make a change  you re not going to get any change in the product   Mr  Stankey said in an interview on Monday Mr  Stankey s assignment is to help AT T beat out its traditional rivals Verizon  T Mobile and Sprint by offering not only service plans but also  Game of Thrones  and 24 hour news  At the same time  AT T s entry into the media sphere will eventually allow it to compete in the streaming business against companies it has rarely done battle with before  including the Walt Disney Company  Comcast  Netflix  Amazon and others He emphasized that AT T didn t want to muddy the brands within Warner Media  a group comprising HBO  CNN  TNT  Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros  film and TV studios  We just needed to get them to sing and dance differently and have them take different approaches   he added With the hiring of Mr  Greenblatt   who has experience as a mainstream broadcaster at NBC and as a programmer of prestige cable fare at Showtime   Mr  Stankey believes he has someone who can make Warner Media s offerings broadly popular  without losing their distinctive identities  There aren t that many people who have both   Mr  Stankey said   He s got the right track record  Mr  Greenblatt  who goes by Bob  took over as chairman of NBC in 2011  when the network was in dire straits  Over his seven years  he brought NBC back from the dead with series like  The Voice   Dick Wolf s fleet of Chicago shows and  This Is Us   NBC  which he left in September  now regularly finishes No  1 among the advertiser prized group of 18 to 49 year old viewers In a statement  Mr  Greenblatt said   I m honored to be joining Warner Media during such an exciting time for the company and the industry as a whole  and I look forward to working alongside the many talented executives and team members across the company  While overseeing HBO and the like  Mr  Greenblatt will also manage the product that may be the most important of all  from AT T s perspective  Warner Media s streaming service  which is scheduled to debut this year Managing New MediaAT T on Monday announced a set of sweeping management changes at WarnerMedia as the carrier prepares to debut a streaming service later this year        g 0305 biz web ATT box  g artboard

for family and kids programming including Cartoon Network  Adult Swim  Boomerang  Otter Media  Turner Classic Movies and licensed consumer products          By The New York TimesOnline video has become crucial to every media business as customers cut their cable cords and go to the movies mainly for big spectacle blockbusters  Netflix and Hulu are signing up millions of new customers every quarter  and entertainment giants like Disney and Comcast plan to start their own services by the end of the year  Amazon is spending more on original shows  and Apple plans to unveil its streaming effort  with new programming  this year The appointment of Mr  Greenblatt allows Warner Media to speed up its plans for a streaming business  a process that was hampered under the older structure  Mr  Stankey said  We had to put a bit of a Band Aid organization on top of things before we made this change   he said   Still  I think we ve done a remarkable job with what we had  The new combined WarnerMedia will be much more successful filling in the gaps  AT T was handcuffed until recently as it fought a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration s Justice Department to block the merger  The company agreed to take a hands off approach to its Turner division  which includes CNN and TNT  until the appeal was concluded  AT T beat back that challenge last week  giving the company free rein Concerning the resignations of Mr  Plepler  who had been at HBO for 27 years  and Mr  Levy  who had spent 32 years at Turner Broadcasting  Mr  Stankey said   I was disappointed but I don t know that I was completely surprised   He added   When you have someone who had a tremendous amount of autonomy  they tend to covet that  Mr  Stankey plans to be a much more active steward of Warner Media than its executives had anticipated  three people familiar with the new AT T said  He has started to consolidate advertising  distribution and production departments across Turner and HBO  as well as some of the back end functions like human resources  accounting and technology  Those moves effectively took away large chunks of matters once overseen by Mr  Plepler and Mr  Levy  the people said In Mr  Stankey s view  Warner Media needed to reorganize the TV networks in a way  where they could cooperate more together   he said  which meant that some top executives would have reduced roles  He said his discussions with Mr  Plepler and Mr  Levy  which took place separately  never got far enough to explore what roles they each might accept Going up against Netflix and Disney will be tough  Mr  Stankey acknowledged that a household is likely to pay for just four or five of these services  and that AT T will have to prove its worth to consumers At a company presentation in November  he outlined three tiers of online video services that have been in the works  an entry level option centered on films  a  premium  service that includes original television programming and films  and a final product that includes both of those tiers plus classic movies  comedy and children s content  Under the plan  HBO would still be available as a stand alone service But it is unclear which Warner Media brands will be part of each tier or how each will be priced  Even the names of the video services remain a mystery  No news on that today   Mr  Stankey said on Monday The lack of hard information on the streaming strategy has frustrated executives within Warner Media  several people familiar with the internal operations have said  But some have wondered if the lack of communication was the result of the Justice Department s court challenge Mr  Stankey acknowledged that his sometimes laconic approach might have baffled those inside the organization   I ve read articles out there saying that I m not prone to flap my gums  and that may not be inaccurate   he said  But Hollywood  not used to such a reserved manner  might require him to open up more   I m trying to find a middle ground on it   he said  adding that with the lawsuit behind them  he ll be able to talk more frequently As part of the reorganization  Mr  Zucker  the head of CNN  will also begin to oversee Turner s sports operations  That includes the website Bleacher Report  as well as Turner s deals with the National Basketball Association  Major League Baseball and the National Collegiate Athletic Association  With the job  Mr  Zucker gets a new title  chairman of news and sports Mr  Tsujihara  the chief executive of the Warner Bros  movie studio  will continue in his position and also take on what Warner Media described as a  new global kids and young adults business   Children s content is likely to be a critical part of the streaming service and represents a big part of Mr  Tsujihara s portfolio  As the economics change  it s becoming more and more important to align content value  consumer products and ad sales   Mr  Tsujihara said in an interview   It takes a real need for deeper level of coordination across the different divisions  
When Paine Field  about 25 miles north of Seattle in Everett  Wash   was born in the 1930s as a New Deal project  it was envisioned as a major commercial airport for the region  But that never happened  Instead  it became known as the place where Boeing offers  North America s only publicly available commercial jet assembly plant tour  That is about to change  Thanks to private investment  Paine Field is finally set to offer air service to the public  A sleek  new   40 million  two gate terminal was built by Propeller Airports  a Seattle company  and commercial flights are set to begin this month Brett Smith  Propeller s founder and chief executive  expects that travelers will be attracted by the convenience of avoiding traffic jams near Seattle Tacoma International Airport   No reason why tax dollars should be used to build passenger travel while there s private sector money ready and willing to do it   he said As governments reduce spending on infrastructure  private companies are moving into airports big and small  paying for private terminals with new types of services and teaming up with local agencies to renovate existing terminals  The so called public private partnerships  or P3s  have created new possibilities for airports  which have struggled for years to find the money to improve terminals and accommodate an increase in passengers and cargo  An Airport Council International report released in 2017 estimated that airports would need almost  100 billion for capital projects over the next five years  but would only be able to finance about half that amount The Paine Field Passenger Terminal  which will serve Alaska Airlines starting early this month  and United Airlines later in March  is just one example of how private money is affecting airport offerings Through a subsidiary  the Schiphol Group of the Netherlands owns Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport  American Airlines owns the airport s Terminal 8  The Private Suite at Los Angeles International Airport opened nearly two years ago  offering those who can afford it a luxurious respite from the crowds at the main terminals  And Denver International Airport is updating the ticket counters  security screening areas  restaurants and shops at Jeppesen Terminal with the help of private money The flow of private money into airports may mean more dining and shopping options for passengers  but it can have downsides  Since private operators try to maximize non aeronautical revenue  some creature comforts may be lacking  We re not at the level of pay toilets  but operators may make it intentionally difficult to find a water fountain   said Henry Harteveldt  founder of Atmosphere Research Group  a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco ImageThe interior of the new terminal  Brett Smith  the founder and chief executive of Propeller  is anticipating that travelers will be attracted by the convenience of avoiding traffic jams near Seattle Tacoma International Airport CreditRodolfo MartinezThe issue of government support for public projects was thrown into sharp relief recently  when Gov  Gavin Newsom of California  a Democrat  announced that he was scaling back a  77 billion project for a high speed bullet train and the Trump administration said it was considering legal options for recovering  2 5 billion in federal money that has already been spent on the project Airport financing works somewhat differently than investment in public works projects  A government covers construction and some maintenance costs  but airports are expected to be self sufficient otherwise and to find other sources of revenue As many as a third of the airports in the United States were privately owned before the Great Depression and the infusion of New Deal spending  according to Deborah Douglas  the curator of science and technology at the M I T  Museum who has studied airports between the world wars Wartime needs changed the dynamic  The underlying principle of airport operations  beginning with World War II  was that local governments should own and operate the airports  and the federal government should provide the capital for construction and some maintenance costs   said Peter Kirsch  a partner at the law firm Kaplan  Kirsch and Rockwell who specializes in transportation Since then  Mr  Kirsch said  there has been an antipathy toward private ownership of  and investment in  public infrastructure  Local governments or airport authorities borrowed to pay for construction  But changes in the economy and in tax laws  he added  meant that  the advantage of public sector borrowing over private sector borrowing has narrowed   Because two major government sources of financing for airports   facility fees and Airport Improvement Program grants   have remained at the same levels for years  the money does not go as far as it once did Short term appropriations from Congress make it difficult for airport officials to plan long term projects  Revenue from restaurants  stores  taxis  rental cars and parking is subject to less oversight  And when third parties maintain private terminals  airports and passengers reap benefits without incurring additional expense Prospective users of Paine Field Passenger Terminal approve of the arrangement  Minda Zetlin  a writer who lives about 15 miles northeast of the airport and nearly 50 miles north of Sea Tac  said that traveling to the larger airport usually required her to use a car service  at an additional cost of  110 each way She said some of her neighbors traveled 65 miles to the airport in Bellingham  Wash   20 miles from the Canadian border  rather than fight traffic into Seattle   Sure  when there s commercial service out of Everett we ll look at that as an attractive alternative   she wrote in an email Yves Junqueira  the founder and chief executive of a Seattle start up  said he traveled at least once a month to San Francisco and San Jose  Calif  He said he alternated between Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines   I have to go to a different terminal  check in on different machines  go to a different gate  go through T S A  on a different line   he wrote in an email  referring to Transportation Security Administration checkpoints  Traveling from Paine Field  he said  might be more efficient The Private Suite  which opened at Los Angeles International Airport in 2017 and is owned and operated by Gavin de Becker and Associates  a private security company  offers a less egalitarian  membership based approach ImageAs governments pull back from spending on infrastructure  private companies are moving into airports big and small  paying for private terminals with new types of services as well as joining local agencies in renovating existing terminalsCreditPropeller AirportsFor an annual  fee of  4 500  with additional charges for each flight  a member and up to three immediate relatives have access to a private lounge  an on call physician  complimentary manicures and massages  free meals and valet parking and other perks  There is a dedicated T S A  security line and a separate area for clearing customs  Passengers are chauffeured directly to their aircraft along the tarmac in a BMW 7 sedan Since May  United Airlines passengers have also been able to use the service  although the prices are different  We don t pay attention to what price ticket you buy   said Anthony Toth  managing director of digital sales for United Airlines  The service is open to any United Airlines passenger departing from Los Angeles at a cost of  375 for domestic flights and  500 for international flights  Private Suite expedites the checking of bags  accepting them up to 45 minutes before domestic flights and an hour before international flights Private Suite expects to generate more than  35 million dollars for Los Angeles World Airports  which operates Los Angeles International  during its 10 year lease   Our service improves security and congestion for all of LAX s passengers  and it s fully funded by those who create the most congestion issues  high risk travelers   said Amina Belouizdad  Private Suite s chief commercial officer At Denver International Airport  construction began in July at Jeppesen Terminal  where the Spanish company Ferrovial is working with JLC Infrastructure and Saunders Concessions on various upgrades  including improved security and new shopping and dining options  The consortium expects to choose  oversee and maintain the terminal s roughly 50 stores and restaurants  for three decades The arrangement allows the airport  to shift the risk for cost and schedule for the very complicated construction  to the public private partnership  Alex Renteria  an airport spokeswoman  said in an email Eliot Lees  vice president and managing director of aviation for ICF  a professional consulting  technology and marketing firm  said that attracting new air service was a major priority for airports  That might mean extra revenue for airports from additional flights and an increase in spending by passengers Still  private terminals require the same level of maintenance as their publicly owned counterparts  Passengers at Terminal 4 at Kennedy Airport discovered that in January 2018 after a snowstorm caused bottlenecks and delayed flights  A water main break at the terminal prolonged the recovery Roel Huinink  the president and chief executive of the Schiphol Group subsidiary that owns the terminal  said the water main had been repaired  The terminal also did a full risk analysis to make sure the problem did not reoccur  Mr  Huinink said Still  a private terminal cannot expect a public bailout if things do not work out financially  And because it is so difficult to leave and re enter the concourse  a passenger is hostage to the airport and whoever is running it  said Mr  Harteveldt  the industry analyst 
BEAUREGARD  Ala    As search and rescue workers raced on Monday to help the rural Alabama communities that had been ravaged by tornadoes  officials said that at least three children were among the 23 people killed by the storms Houses lay shredded and entire neighborhoods flattened in the wake of Sunday s storms in Lee County  Ala   where the deaths occurred  Sheriff Jay Jones of Lee County said it was as if someone  took a giant knife and just scraped the ground  Read  As Tornadoes Roared Across Alabama   There Wasn t Even Time to Be Afraid Sheriff Jones said that several people were still unaccounted for  and that crews were sorting through the debris in hopes of finding survivors Bill Harris  the Lee County coroner  said the three children among the dead were a 6 year old  a 9 year old who died at the hospital and a 10 year old  He said he had been told that in at least one case multiple members of the same family had died Here are the latest developments   Sheriff Jones said on Monday afternoon that the death toll remained at 23  with no new victims found since Sunday    Several people   a number in the double digits   were still unaccounted for  he said  without giving the exact figure   Dozens of people were sent to hospitals on Sunday with injuries  with at least two in intensive care   The National Weather Service said Monday that it believed the tornado that raced through Lee County had been an EF 4 storm  with winds of 170 miles an hour   Chris Darden  the meteorologist in charge for the weather service s Birmingham office  said the track of the  monster tornado  appeared to have been at least 24 miles long  and that the storm had been nearly a mile wide   Gov  Kay Ivey of Alabama said she had spoken with President Trump and received assurances of federal support A 10 year old girl is among the victimsTaylor Thornton  10  had been camping with her best friend for several days and was at the friend s father s mobile home in Beauregard when the storm hit on Sunday Taylor s mother  Ashley Thornton  said in a telephone interview that she got a call around 2 p m  Sunday from the friend s mother  who is divorced from the father  The mother had had no luck reaching the father by phone  could Ms  Thornton try When she couldn t get through either  her husband  David Thornton  drove toward the home  and then got out and walked when snapped trees blocked the way  When he arrived   there was no house left   he told his wife by phone  he recognized the place only by a motorcycle parked outside Ms  Thornton said her husband persuaded a sheriff s deputy to let him onto the property  where he saw Taylor s body  The deputy let him carry her to a waiting vehicle  The few times I ve talked to him  all he s told me was that she looked like she was sleeping   Ms  Thornton said  When the identity of the body was confirmed  she said  family and friends  just kind of crumbled  As of Monday afternoon  Ms  Thornton said  she had not been told exactly how Taylor died  other than that  the tornado had gone through and destroyed everything  Ms  Thornton said her daughter was a smiling  well behaved girl who loved horses and God and spending time with her best friend   Just the sweetest  kindest little thing in the whole world   she said The friend was injured in the storm but survived  Ms  Thornton said  the friend s father and one of his friends were killed Mr  Thornton  she said   is still trying to process this   he s having a hard time right now  The search for survivors continuesSheriff Jones said on Monday afternoon that search and rescue teams were not yet finished sweeping the hardest hit area  a square mile of land in Beauregard  an unincorporated community of 8 000 to 10 000 people south of Opelika More than 100 people had joined the search  supported by drones with infrared sensors that can detect heat signatures of trapped survivors  Most of the residences in the area are mobile or manufactured homes  and dozens had been destroyed  Some debris appeared to have been thrown more than a half mile by the winds  the sheriff said Kathrine Carson  the emergency management director for Lee County  said the tornado was  the worst natural disaster that has ever occurred in Lee County  Mr  Darden  the meteorologist  said that the tornado was the deadliest in the United States since 2013  when a tornado in Moore  Okla   killed 24 people Mr  Harris  the Lee County coroner  said it would be necessary to fingerprint six of the victims in Alabama to identify them ImageDamage in Beauregard  Ala   on Monday after a tornado touched down the day before CreditAudra Melton for The New York Times It s been a long  long night   Mr  Harris said   These families  some of them have lost just about the entire family  Apart from the EF 4 storm in Lee County  the Weather Service also assessed two other tornado tracks to the south in Macon County and Barbour County  Ala   and rated the tornadoes that touched down there as EF 1 storms  with wind speeds of at least 86 miles an hour A family huddled together to ride out the stormAs the tornado pulverized the small brick house in Opelika in which three generations of Evony Lashawn Wilson s family cowered together in a bathroom  Ms  Wilson s 15 year old son looked at her and said   Mom  I don t want to die  Ms  Wilson said that her son  Qumran  had long feared the weather  growing up in the shadow of the tornadoes that killed more than 230 people across Alabama in 2011  Now  his nightmares were coming true The tornado stripped away their roof  The bathroom walls collapsed around Ms  Wilson  44  her son  husband and her 72 year old mother  The wind crushed them against one another  When Ms  Wilson looked up  she saw trees and debris swirling overhead Her husband urged their son to hang on  Ms  Wilson pushed Qumran s head down and told him to keep praying  Just the sound   it was something you never forget   Ms  Wilson said in a telephone interview on Monday morning   You could hear everything coming apart  When the tornado passed  Ms  Wilson s son and husband managed to wriggle out of the debris and went to look for help through their neighborhood of trailer homes and one story houses that had been all but reduced to pulp  Ms  Wilson stayed behind with her mother  who has severe health problems and cannot walk far As they huddled in the wreckage of the bathroom  now exposed to the elements  Ms  Wilson s phone buzzed with another tornado alert  She lay across her mother on the floor and tried to shelter both of them with a fallen bathroom cabinet as another wave of wind roared over them Ms  Wilson s mother fractured her hip in the storm  and Ms  Wilson fractured her ankle  The brick house  which had belonged to Ms  Wilson s mother  was destroyed  and so was the mobile home next door  where Ms  Wilson and her family lived There were more tornado deaths on Sunday than in all of 2018There has been a relative lull in deadly tornadoes in the United States lately  especially in 2018  when only nine deadly tornadoes were reported  causing 10 deaths  A more typical year might see 15 to 20 deadly tornadoes  according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration statistics ImageA piece of metal wrapped around a tree in Beauregard CreditSocial Media ReutersContrast that with 2011  the most ferocious year for tornadoes in decades  when 59 deadly storms claimed 553 lives  Nearly all struck in a three month period from late February to late May  including one tornado in Missouri that left 158 people dead  Science writers for The New York Times answered questions about why that season had been so brutal  and other facts and fictions about tornadoes After the 2011 outbreak  which killed more than 230 people in Alabama alone  some communities ordered upgrades to storm shelters  and residents became extraordinarily sensitive about even the threat of poor weather Tornadoes can strike nearly anywhere in the country when conditions are right  but they are most common in the southern Plains and the South  especially in a broad area called Dixie Alley stretching from Kansas and Oklahoma to Georgia Sunday s weather was a  fairly classic  pattern for March  where colder air mixes with warmer air  said James Spann  the chief meteorologist for WBMA television  the local ABC affiliate  This is clearly the biggest loss of life we ve had in my state in a while   he said   In fact  we had more deaths in Lee County  Ala   today than the entire United States last year  The Places in the U S  Where Disaster Strikes Again and AgainIn the last 16 years  most of the damages caused by catastrophes like wildfires and hurricanes have been concentrated in just a few areas An outpouring of help as a church prepares for evacueesScores of volunteers converged on Providence Baptist Church in Opelika on Monday and began sorting supplies  which were soon stacked high on folding tables There were piles of clothes and pyramids of blankets  Beneath one table  a cardboard box held Ziploc bags of essentials  toilet paper  toothpaste  soap and the like  Cases of bottled water lined one wall  This is how things work in a small community  When help is needed  everyone gets together and gets it done   said Scarlett Baker  who was serving as the de facto mayor of the relief operation at Providence By midmorning  her wish list was becoming clearer  Children s Motrin and Tylenol  so those with mild fevers could avoid crowded hospitals  Baby wipes  Ointments The church was preparing for a possible influx of evacuees after sundown on Monday  During the day  volunteers said  they expected that many people were out trying to salvage what remained of their homes Here s how you can helpIf you re outside the affected area  sending money to established charities is the best way to help  The American Red Cross can be reached by phone at  334  749 9981 or online  The Alabama Governor s Relief

Good Wednesday morning  Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today                        On Oct  18  2017  President Trump took the time to sign a  35 000 check to Michael D  Cohen  his longtime lawyer and fixer who had made hush payments to prevent alleged sexual misconduct by Mr  Trump from being exposed before the 2016 presidential election  It was one of 11 occasions that Mr  Trump or his trust cut such checks  six of which were provided this week to the The Times   Mr  Trump signaled that he did not intend to cooperate with the 81 document requests sent out by House lawmakers scrutinizing whether the president obstructed justice  and he called the investigation a  disgrace to our country    The House s Democratic leadership  responding to statements by Representative Ilhan Omar characterized as hurtful to Jews  will put to a vote a resolution condemning anti Semitism  The resolution has started a furious generational debate between older House Democrats and their young  liberal counterparts   More than 76 000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February  an 11 year high and a sign that the Trump administration s aggressive policies have not discouraged new migration   Michael R  Bloomberg  the former mayor of New York  says he will not run for president in 2020  Instead  he plans to use his considerable wealth to finance the opposition to Mr  Trump  and to support causes like gun control and climate change   Jeff Merkley  a two term senator from Oregon  has also opted out of running for the 2020 presidential nomination  forgoing what would have been a long shot bid against some of the most famous names in Democratic politics   Mr  Trump often accuses China of destroying American jobs  But the president s appointments at the Federal Trade Commission have done little to crack down on four companies that falsely marketed products from China as American made   Mr  Trump has decided to strip India of a special status that exempts billions of dollars  worth of Indian exports from American tariffs  raising new trade tensions with the world s second most populous country   Scott Gottlieb  the Food and Drug Administration commissioner known for his aggressive efforts to regulate the tobacco and e cigarette industries in the pro business Trump administration  resigned Tuesday                      Today s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York Were you forwarded this newsletter  Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox Is there anything you think we re missing  Anything you want to see more of  We d love to hear from you  Email us at onpolitics nytimes com 
What WAS Said President Obama  from what they tell me  was under a similar kind of a thing  didn t give one letter  They didn t do anything  They didn t give one letter of the request  Many requests were made  They didn t give a letter    President Trump  at the White House on TuesdayFalse Republicans took control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections and opened a number of investigations into the Obama administration  While Mr  Obama did invoke executive privilege in at least one instance  Mr  Trump is wrong that his predecessor did not turn over any documents at all One of the first controversies that drew scrutiny from Republicans in Congress was Operation Fast and Furious  a botched federal gun trafficking case  Mr  Trump may have been referring to Mr  Obama s assertion of executive privilege over some 1 300 pages of documents related to the case  A federal judge ruled against the Obama administration in 2016  Beyond the batch of documents covered by the court ruling  congressional investigators obtained more than 10 000 pages of additional material  including nearly 7 000 from the Justice Department after subpoenas From February 2011 to August 2012  a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee investigated Solyndra  a solar power company that received  527 million in government loans and declared bankruptcy  The final report faulted the Obama administration for delaying the document gathering process  but still obtained over 300 000 pages of documents from the White House  federal agencies and Solyndra and its counsel Congress opened more than half a dozen investigations into the State Department s handling of the attacks on American facilities in Benghazi  Libya  on Sept  11  2012  The House Select Committee on Benghazi  which conducted the longest lasting inquiry  said in its December 2016 final report that it began with 50 000 pages of documents   though it said half of them were useless   and obtained an additional 75 000 pages of new material  including 1 450 pages from the White House The House Oversight Committee and the Senate Finance Committee both looked into claims that the Internal Revenue Service improperly targeted conservative groups seeking tax exempt status  A bipartisan report from the Senate committee  released in 2015  said that the White House provided a  limited number of documents  sent to or from the I R S  official at the center of the inquiry  Lois Lerner  while the tax agency provided 1 3 million pages of material None of those inquiries scrutinized Mr  Obama s personal finances or business interests  as Democrats have sought to do with their document request targeting Mr  Trump  But unlike Mr  Trump  Mr  Obama had voluntarily released his tax returns  And Mr  Obama did not have business holdings that raised possible conflict of interest issues Curious about the accuracy of a claim  Email factcheck nytimes com  
WILMINGTON  Del    Tom Vari s lighting suppliers began mailing him warnings about tariffs last fall  They varied a bit in dates and percentages  but they all said the same thing  Very soon  your prices are going up Mr  Vari owns Brandywine Lighting Gallery  a 2 000 square foot independent showroom on a busy highway north of Wilmington  Almost everything he sells is made in China  meaning that since September  his products have been subject to a 10 percent tax on Chinese imports levied by the Trump administration  So far  Mr  Vari has largely absorbed those costs  by accepting lower profits  But he   and his suppliers   say they won t be able to shield customers from dramatic price increases much longer President Trump insists that his trade war will make America better off and that until it s resolved  China is paying billions of dollars in tariffs to the United States  But it is small business owners like Mr  Vari  and his customers  who are largely footing the bill for Mr  Trump s tariffs  As the trade war reaches into its second year  companies and consumers across the United States are growing weary  Small businesses like Brandywine Lighting have been forced to adapt to new economic realities brought about by Mr  Trump s trade fight with China  Europe  Canada and Mexico and those companies are now beginning to chafe as the fight drags on  putting their profitability at risk The United States and China are moving closer to a deal that would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific  while requiring the Chinese to buy more American goods and make some changes to its trade practices  While details are still being discussed  the agreement does not appear to require the sweeping changes to China s economy that prompted Mr  Trump to begin the trade war For Mr  Vari  a resolution could not come soon enough  If no deal is reached  he is worried that he will be priced out of the market by bigger competitors who can more easily absorb the tariffs costs and not pass them along to customers  I have to make a decision  if I am going to raise my prices  or I m going to hold my prices  so people realize I m trying to help them   Mr  Vari said   Help only goes so far  when you re a mom and pop store like this  Mr  Trump initially imposed tariffs on  50 billion in Chinese imports last spring  in retaliation for trade practices that Mr  Trump said hurt American jobs and industries  He added tariffs on an additional  200 billion worth of goods in late September  including on many home goods such as lighting supplies  The president initially threatened to raise tariffs on that second tranche to 25 percent from 10 percent on March 2  but much to Mr  Vari s relief  the president agreed last month to delay that increase  citing progress in the talks So far  the tariffs on Chinese goods have yet to translate into large price increases across the United States economy  Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimated  that China tariffs have added 0 1 percent to inflation for consumers and 0 3 percent for business investment goods But there are signs that the tariffs have raised prices for Americans who buy imported lighting  The Labor Department reports monthly inflation statistics for  clocks  lamps and decorator items  in the United States  Like many consumer goods  those items have experienced steady deflation over the last decade   meaning they re either getting cheaper  or they are improving in value  or both  From 2008 to 2018  the Consumer Price Index for those goods fell by an average of 6 percent a year That trend reversed once tariffs took effect  From September of 2018 to January this year  the price index rose by 2 7 percent A much sharper increase could be on the way  if the letters from Mr  Vari s suppliers are an indication ImageMany of the products at Brandywine Lighting Gallery are imported from China  Since September  those imports have been subject to a 10 percent tariff CreditRyan Collerd for The New York TimesHe has been collecting them for months here at his store  which employs four full timers and one part timer  The showroom is packed with hundreds of chandeliers  floor lamps  bath fixtures  bed fixtures and glowing guides for outdoor walkways  There is no warehouse attached  which means he stocks one  maybe two  of everything customers see here  He has stacks of catalogs they can order from if they d like more options In an industry increasingly dominated by online retailers and big box stores  Brandywine s business model is customer service  Employees here will spend hours  if needed  helping customers decide on the right fixture  Those on the fence can take a light home to try it out  no obligation to buy Still  Mr  Vari must keep his prices competitive   and his margins healthy enough to pay his bills  That s why the letters from suppliers concerned him this fall   Price increase announcement   one read  explaining that the September wave of tariffs would push up costs of several brands by 6 percent   I can only hope that the trade war ceases before another 15 percent tariff increase goes into effect   another said  Some of his invoices began breaking out a  tariff per unit  so Mr  Vari could see what the trade war was already costing him In the early letters  suppliers said they were absorbing some of the tariff costs themselves  But they have increasingly warned store owners to stock up on inventory ahead of any further escalation  which the letters say will be almost entirely passed on as price increases  Big box retailers have the money and the shelf space to stock up  Mr  Vari does not He has shielded some  but not all  customers from price increases so far  The decision is all about margins  Mr  Vari said he couldn t afford to absorb tariff costs on everyday home lighting  where industry competition is higher and profit margins are already low  Their prices have risen in his showroom  so that every sale does not actually cost him money Mr  Vari s bigger margins come from large scale lighting projects  like kitchen renovations and landscaping  He has not raised prices there yet  because he does not want to drive away customers  viewing it as a trade off between lower profits today for a larger clientele in the long run  If the tariffs rise again  however  he will have to raise those prices  We ll still be O K    Mr  Vari said   because I won t be a pig about it  But he worries  he said  about  customers never pulling the trigger  if a large project suddenly costs  1 000 more than it would have Mr  Vari has been in the lighting business  in one way or another  for 40 years  He recalls when a large share of the products he sold were made in the United States  That was the 1980s  before the industry migrated to China What is left of the domestic lighting industry today  he said  is so high end that he cannot afford to stock it   Great products   Mr  Vari said   But the whole idea of bringing the industry back here  That s what it will be  High paid people  High paid producers  And only the rich will be able to afford them  Mr  Trump s promises to bring that type of manufacturing back to the United States are  political bullcrap   Mr  Vari said   Some people believe that just because Trump s pressuring China  we re going to be an industrial powerhouse again  It s not going to happen  Mr  Vari recently warned customers about the impact of tariffs in a social media post  where he said Mr  Trump s actions were going to make lighting more expensive  It drew immediate criticism from Mr  Trump s supporters   The haters came like that   Mr  Vari said   I ll never do a post like that again  Instead  he is spreading the word about price increases in traditional small business fashion  owner to customer  one person at a time 
Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  Larry Hogan is a guy who has spent a whole lot of time talking about running for president But none of it  he says  is his idea In recent weeks  Mr  Hogan  the Republican governor of deeply blue Maryland  has become the avatar of the G O P  s  Never Trump  faction  carefully positioning himself as the reluctant savior ready to step in for his party should a big bombshell drop Mr  Hogan is a popular politician with an interesting   and perhaps prescient   personal story  His father  as a member of the House Judiciary Committee  was the very first Republican to come out for President Richard M  Nixon s impeachment  and was the only congressional Republican to vote for all three articles of impeachment Mr  Hogan says he had never given much thought to being president before he was approached by prominent Trump critics like William Kristol  a leader of the motley crew of moderate Republicans  libertarians and foreign policy hawks who make up the Never Trump movement   No interest  no thought  no desire  no plans   he told me and my colleague Alex Burns in an interview last week  I guess I just left the door open  saying   You never say never    he said   I don t know what s going to happen in the next several months  He was in Iowa today for a National Governors Association event  A trip to New Hampshire later this spring is being considered Mr  Hogan is right  A lot can happen in the next few months  particularly given the news today that the House Judiciary Committee requested documents from 81 agencies  individuals and companies tied to the president  including his sons and son in law  Jared Kushner Former Gov  John Kasich and former Senator Jeff Flake have talked about challenging the president  and at least one potential opponent is nearly in the race already   former Gov  William F  Weld of Massachusetts  who started  an exploratory committee last month But there are a few key facts to remember when you hear Republicans floating the idea 1  No sitting president in the modern era has been successfully unseated in a primary 2  Mr  Trump is still really  really popular among Republicans  An NBC News Wall Street Journal poll released over the weekend found that nearly 90 percent of Republicans approve of the president 3  Despite the best efforts of the Never Trump movement  the party establishment   the national committee  members of Congress and party activists   is firmly behind Mr  Trump  They have the right to jump in and lose  They ll lose horribly   said the Republican National Committee chairwoman  Ronna Romney McDaniel  at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference this past weekend   Have at it  Go ahead  Waste your money  waste your time and go ahead and lose  That s not to say a primary race would have no effect on Mr  Trump  Strong primary challenges contributed to the general election defeats of Presidents Gerald Ford  Jimmy Carter and George Bush But a strong challenge   meaning one that has a chance of actual success   is pretty unlikely Irrespective of the president  both Mr  Hogan and Mr  Weld would most likely face a serious uphill climb to win over Republican voters  given their differences with much of the base  Mr  Kasich failed to win any state but his own when he ran for president in 2016 as a more moderate voice In our interview  Mr  Hogan criticized Republicans in Congress for having tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act without proposing a suitable alternative  He said that he believed Roe v  Wade  which made abortion legal nationwide  had been correctly decided  And he declined to express any personal view of whether the Senate had been right to confirm Justice Brett M  Kavanaugh  a vote that awarded Republicans control of the Supreme Court for a generation For his part  Mr  Hogan  a popular governor who won with cross party support  says he fears the current administration is  shrinking  the party s base  leaving Republicans at a serious disadvantage in their efforts to  reach a wider audience and to not alienate people and not to be as divisive  He may be right  But that s not an argument likely to win over Republican voters Just ask Mr  Kasich                     Drop us a line ImageWe want to hear

who is a woman    as a way of testing voter biases The results held some good news for the historically diverse Democratic field  Only 10 percent expressed reservations with an African American candidate and 14 percent with a female candidate  Comfort with a gay or lesbian candidate surged to 68 percent  up from 43 percent in 2006 But the biggest takeaway could be bad news for a candidate

WASHINGTON   President Trump has decided to strip India of a special status that exempts billions of dollars worth of Indian exports from American tariffs  raising new trade tensions with the world s second most populous country The Office of the United States Trade Representative said on Monday night that  India and Turkey would no longer be eligible for preferential market access to the United States  While the decision to terminate Turkey s status stemmed from that country s economic development  the move against India was retaliatory  It came after a year of failed efforts by the Trump administration to compel India to lower its trade barriers  including the tariffs it charges on American goods Mr  Trump s decision to confront India over its trade practices ratchets up trade tensions at a moment when the administration has been trying to ease frictions with China  which have rattled global financial markets and unsettled businesses But India s high tariff rates have been a major source of frustration for Mr  Trump  who has repeatedly assailed India for charging steep tariffs on American motorcycles  The president routinely criticizes India s  unfair  trade practices and highlighted the disparity between how the United States and India treat imports in sharply worded remarks during last weekend s Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington  India is a very  very high tariff nation  and they charge tremendous  tremendous numbers   Mr  Trump said  adding that he wanted to impose a  reciprocal tax  on India Mr  Trump frequently cites Harley Davidson when complaining about India s trade practices  criticizing the country for charging 50 percent duties on Harleys and other motorcycles  While Harley Davidson does sell motorcycles in India  it has moved much of that production abroad to avoid tariffs and has opened a factory outside New Delhi  Most of the 3 000 Harleys sold in India last year avoided the tariffs Beyond motorcycles  India has angered American medical device makers with price caps on items such as cardiac stents and knee implants  New policies restricting Visa  Mastercard and American Express also kicked in last year  and Walmart and Amazon have been upset about the new e commerce policies recently imposed in India The United States and India engaged in  126 2 billion worth of trade in 2017  according to United States trade representative  with the United States running a goods and services deficit of  27 3 billion  About  5 billion of Indian exports to the United States were eligible for reduced tariffs under the Generalized System of Preferences program  or G S P  According to India s Ministry of Commerce and Industry  the program has allowed for  190 million per year in duty reduction  It s survivable  but painful nonetheless   said Richard Rossow  an expert in United States India relations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Mr  Rossow noted that the tariffs could be enough to encourage American importers to buy some products from Mexico or Vietnam instead of India  The program covered imports of items such as automobile parts  agricultural products  jewelry and handicrafts For its part  India has been upset by the steel and aluminum tariffs that the United States imposed last year as well as restrictions on H 1B visas for foreign workers and spouses of H 1B visa holders The Trump administration initiated a review of India s preferential trade status in 2018  and in recent months there have been increasing signs that negotiations were going poorly  Last year  Robert Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  was expected to travel to India but ended up not going  In February Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  backed out of a planned trip and blamed bad weather Mr  Lighthizer s office said this week that  despite  intensive engagement   India had failed to take the necessary steps to keep its tariff exemptions  The United States has been particularly concerned about market access for dairy and medical devices  India has implemented a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on United States commerce   the agency said in a statement India pushed back against such accusations on Tuesday  arguing that it was willing to work with the United States but that some of the demands were unreasonable  India was able to offer a very meaningful way forward on almost all the U S  requests   the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement   In a few instances  specific U S  requests were not found reasonable and doable at this time by the departments concerned  in light of public welfare concerns reflective of India s developing country status and its national interest  The change to India s trade status will take place in 60 days  Lawmakers and business groups expressed hope on Tuesday that a deal could still be worked out  The Indian government hasn t engaged enough to address market access issues   said Senator Charles E  Grassley of Iowa  the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee   For the sake of the many Americans and Indians who relied on G S P  benefits  I hope that India will work to quickly address these legitimate concerns  
WASHINGTON   America s trade deficit in goods with the rest of the world rose to its highest level in history last year as the United States imported a record number of products  including from China  widening the deficit to  891 3 billion and delivering a setback to President Trump s goal of narrowing that gap The increase was driven by some factors outside Mr  Trump s control  like a global economic slowdown and the relative strength of the United States dollar  both of which weakened overseas demand for American goods  But the widening gap was also exacerbated by Mr  Trump s  1 5 trillion tax cut  which has been largely financed by government borrowing  and the trade war he escalated last year It is a case of textbook economics catching up with some of Mr  Trump s unorthodox economic policies  Economists have long warned that Mr  Trump s tax cuts would ultimately exacerbate a trade deficit he has vowed to reduce  as Americans  flush with extra cash  bought more imported goods His trade war with Beijing also widened the gap  Stiff tariffs on Chinese goods helped slow China s economy  crimping American exports  which declined nearly 50 percent in December from the same month a year before  All countries run trade deficits whenever they consume more than they produce   said Kimberly Clausing  an economist at Reed College in Oregon   And when we borrow to finance tax cuts  like we did with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  we make these imbalances worse  The trade deficit is the difference between how much a country sells to its trading partners and how much it buys  It generally includes both goods and services  though Mr  Trump has focused almost exclusively on the deficit in goods  He has long boasted that his trade policies would reduce that gap  which he views as a measure of whether partners like China and the European Union are taking advantage of the United States  a diagnosis few economists share Instead  in a year in which Mr  Trump imposed tariffs on steel  aluminum  washing machines  solar panels and a variety of Chinese goods  the overall trade deficit grew 12 5 percent from 2017  or nearly  70 billion  to  621 billion  the Commerce Department said Wednesday  Although the United States recorded a trade surplus in services  the trade deficit in goods with the European Union and Mexico grew more than 10 percent as imports rose faster than exports In December  the overall deficit in goods and services  which includes everything from computers and washing machines to tourism and intellectual property  rose 19 percent from the previous month  to  59 8 billion  It was the highest monthly trade deficit since 2008  when the American economy was mired in recession Several global economic factors explain the widening of the deficit last year  China s slowdown has reduced consumer appetite for American goods  as has slowing growth in Europe  The strength of the dollar in global currency markets has made it cheaper for American consumers to buy foreign made goods  and more difficult for foreign customers to buy American made ones That helped fuel a record number of Chinese goods imported into the United States  The trade gap in goods between the United States and China hit  419 billion in 2018  deepening a bilateral deficit that has been a particular source of anger for Mr  Trump         g trade deficits box  g artboard

seasonally adjusted   Source  The United States Bureau of Economic AnalysisBy The New York TimesWhile Mr  Trump sees the trade deficit as a sort of economic scorecard for which country is on top  most economists disagree with this perspective  viewing trade deficits not as a sign of economic strength or weakness  but as a function of macroeconomic factors like investment flows  fluctuations in the value of currency and relative growth rates And as the trade deficit widens  Mr  Trump s focus on it has resulted in a particular irony  By his own metric  the president is failing to right America s global trading relationships  Yet many of the president s critics do not blame him for this  saying some fluctuations in the trade deficit are largely beyond his control  The stronger trade deficit in the short run is telling you we re importing more  so it s not a particular alarming development   said Lawrence H  Summers  a Harvard economist who directed the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama   The president notwithstanding  I d rather live in a country that capital is trying to get into  rather than get out of  The reason we have a trade deficit is people are investing in America  Mr  Trump has aimed tariffs at China  Europe  Canada and Mexico to help reset the trade balance with other countries that he says engage in unfair practices to gain a competitive edge in global trade That is particularly true with China  which Mr  Trump and many business groups say tilts the balance of power by providing state subsidies  blocking foreign competition and engaging in other tactics  His top advisers are pressing Beijing to commit to a specific target for reducing the bilateral trade imbalance between the countries  While the Chinese have offered to make large purchases of American products  including soybeans and liquefied natural gas  they have resisted setting a specific dollar target for the trade balance  arguing that such a metric is largely beyond their control In a congressional hearing last week  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  held up a chart that showed a steadily rising trade deficit with China  Also marked on the chart were various negotiations past administrations had held with China  which Mr  Lighthizer said had failed to stem the deficit s rise  He called the deficit with China  along with China s unfair trade practices   major threats to our economy  The value of China s currency  which is determined partly by the market and partly by the government  weakened against the dollar last year  blunting the effect of Mr  Trump s tariffs by making Chinese goods even cheaper  The currency began rising again in the fall  as President Xi Jinping of China met Mr  Trump in Argentina late last year to begin hammering out a trade pact  said Brad Setser  a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations  China certainly allowed the market to push the value of the yuan down against the dollar over the summer   Mr  Setser said As part of the trade deal in the works  the United States has secured a commitment from Beijing not to artificially weaken its currency  according to administration officials The relative strength of the United States economy is also a large factor in the widening deficit  along with the  1 5 trillion tax cut Mr  Trump signed in 2017  which accelerated growth last year Money from the tax cuts helped Americans buy more imported goods than ever in 2018  And to finance the tax cuts  the government needed to borrow more dollars  some of which came from foreign investors  Foreigners primarily get those dollars by selling more goods and services to Americans  which will necessarily widen the trade gap  an effect that many economists predicted at the time Mr  Trump signed the tax cuts The tax cuts are also helping to swell the federal budget deficit  which Mr  Trump similarly pledged to reduce   and  in fact  eliminate   as a candidate  On Tuesday  Treasury Department figures showed the budget deficit widening  and it is on track to top  1 trillion this fiscal year  Revenue from personal and corporate income taxes was down by 9 percent in January  compared with the same month a year ago As with the trade deficit  many economists are growing less alarmed by the budget deficit than in previous years  However  Federal Reserve officials and some economists warn that federal borrowing is growing too quickly and will ultimately swamp the American economy  with the United States paying huge sums of interest on the debt  diverting funds from social safety net programs like Medicare and Social Security  The Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  warned lawmakers at a House hearing last week that the federal debt was on an  unsustainable  path Mr  Powell was asked during the hearing if he would also say that the trade deficit was unsustainable   I don t think I would say that   he replied

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Wednesday weakened a rule that required the government to annually make public its estimates of civilian bystanders killed in airstrikes outside conventional war zones   increasing the secrecy that cloaks one of the most contentious aspects of the fight against terrorists In an executive order  Mr  Trump revoked a disclosure requirement that President Barack Obama  imposed in July 2016  The change was the latest in a series of ways that Mr  Trump has dismantled the architecture that Mr  Obama built over time to constrain the use of drone strikes and commando raids targeting Islamist militants in places like tribal Pakistan and rural Yemen But Mr  Trump s executive order noted that since 2016  Congress has enacted a law that separately requires the Pentagon to issue annual reports about bystander deaths from all of its operations  including in conventional war zones like Afghanistan and Syria Citing that law  the National Security Council said in a statement that the Obama era rule amounted to  superfluous reporting requirements  requirements that do not improve government transparency  but rather distract our intelligence professionals from their primary mission  Still  the law requiring disclosure of bystander deaths covers only the Defense Department s operations  It does not extend to airstrikes by the C I A   which has carried out its own drone campaign targeting terrorism suspects in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen Rita Siemion  the international legal counsel at Human Rights First  a nonprofit advocacy group  criticized the Trump administration s move  It s a major step backwards that s out of touch with what the D O D  is doing and what Congress has been focused on   she said  referring to the Defense Department The revocation of the disclosure rule joins other steps Mr  Trump has taken since becoming president to dismantle constraints Mr  Obama had imposed on counterterrorism operations Soon after taking office  Mr  Trump quietly deemed large sections of Yemen and Somalia to be  areas of active hostilities  subject to war zone rules  In battle  it can be lawful to carry out a strike at a military target  knowing that some nearby civilians may die  so long as the collateral damage is deemed to be necessary and proportionate And later in 2017  Mr  Trump rescinded a set of rules  known as the Presidential Policy Guidance  that the Obama administration had imposed on counterterrorism operations away from hot battlefields  Those limits included a requirement that targets of kill missions by the military and the C I A  be limited to high level militants rather than foot soldier jihadists without any special training or leadership role  and a requirement for high level  interagency vetting of proposed attacks Still  Mr  Trump s changes in 2017 left in place a requirement that strikes away from conventional war zones take place only when military officers had  near certainty  that no civilians would be killed  Similarly  his executive order on Wednesday left in place other aspects of Mr  Obama s directive that require the government to make a priority of preventing civilian casualties  The United States government is fully committed to complying with its obligations under the law of armed conflict  minimizing  to the greatest extent possible  civilian casualties  and acknowledging responsibility when they unfortunately occur during military operations   the National Security Council statement said In a sense  Mr  Trump s revocation of the disclosure rule amounted to a belated acknowledgment that his administration had already changed the Obama policy in practice  The director of national intelligence never put out a report about bystander casualties in 2017  even though the Obama era order requiring one remained on the books last year  when the report was due out Several other factors somewhat lowered the stakes of Mr  Trump s move  First  the C I A  appears to be carrying out fewer drone strikes than it did during the height of the Obama administration s counterterrorism operations The last drone strike was reported more than a year ago in the tribal area of Pakistan  where the C I A  took the lead in handling airstrikes  according to Bill Roggio  a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies  who has tracked airstrikes for more than a decade on his Long War Journal  While Yemen is still being bombed  it is hard to determine whether the American government or the Saudi Emirati coalition battling the Houthis  an Iran allied rebel faction  are conducting the strikes  he said Moreover  even when the Obama administration revealed the official assessment of how many civilians had died  those numbers were merely a vague range and lower than estimates by outsiders like the Long War Journal  the Washington based security policy organization New America and the London based Bureau of Investigative Journalism The Obama administration estimated that from its start in 2009 until mid 2016  64 to 116 civilian bystanders were killed in such strikes  Outside groups  estimates ranged from roughly 200 to 800  But because the official statistics did not break numbers down by location and date  it was difficult to make sense of the discrepancy  I think we will never truly know the number of civilians killed in airstrikes in these areas away from active battlefields   Mr  Roggio said   The reality is that these strikes take place where the government  news organizations and human rights groups have limited visibility  and the enemy has shown a propensity to attempt to manipulate the information  Joshua Geltzer  who served as the senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council from 2015 to 2017  acknowledged that the disclosure rule did not go as far as human rights groups wanted  But he said it was nevertheless a major step forward whose loss may create security risks  not just increase secrecy  This is a bad move not just for transparency  but also for those who believe that tools like drone strikes need to remain available to the government for countering terrorism   he said   The continued availability of that tool rests in part in confidence in how it is being used  and this was an important step in giving the public some insight into that  
The Democratic National Committee said on Wednesday that it had barred Fox News from hosting or televising a candidate debate for the party s 2020 primary election  an unusually pointed rebuke of a cable news channel whose star pundits are closely aligned with President Trump The committee s chairman  Tom Perez  said in a statement that Fox News  is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates   Mr  Perez cited an article published this week by The New Yorker that reported on ties between the president and the network  which he deemed an  inappropriate relationship  Fox News  which devotes its prime time hours to pro Trump commentary  was seen in broadcast circles as a long shot to sponsor a gathering of Democratic candidates  But the network had made an aggressive pitch to party officials  noting  for instance  that the  Fox News Sunday  anchor  Chris Wallace  had won plaudits after moderating the third general election debate in 2016  We hope the D N C  will reconsider its decision to bar Chris Wallace  Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum  all of whom embody the ultimate journalistic integrity and professionalism  from moderating a Democratic presidential debate   Bill Sammon  managing editor of Fox News s Washington bureau  said in a statement   They offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest TV news audience in America  which includes many persuadable voters  Mr  Trump weighed in Wednesday evening  sarcastically praising the Democrats  decision   Good  then I think I ll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates   he wrote on Twitter The president often tweets idle threats  But his message raised the prospect that Mr  Trump could boycott a debate in the 2020 race if he took issue with the network affiliation of a chosen moderator  General election debates are not sponsored by individual networks  they are overseen by an independent commission and typically aired on all major stations In early 2016  Mr  Trump did boycott a primary debate   which was sponsored by Fox News  He had objected to the inclusion of the anchor Megyn Kelly as a moderator Televised debates are a relatively new innovation in the presidential primary process  but they have become sought after events for networks eager to score high ratings and serve as gatekeepers in the early months of the nominating cycle  when viewers are forming their initial impressions of the candidates Democratic officials had signaled some openness to collaborating with Fox News on a debate in 2019 or 2020  saying they were trying to reach a broad national audience But the party came under pressure this week after the report in The New Yorker  by the veteran journalist Jane Mayer  which laid out the sometimes symbiotic relationship between Mr  Trump and the network he follows closely Network stars like Sean Hannity regularly advise the president  and Mr  Hannity spoke at a Trump campaign rally last year  high fiving the president s deputy chief of staff  Bill Shine  himself a former Fox News president  Other Fox News alumni  like Heather Nauert and Kimberly Guilfoyle  have joined the administration or Mr  Trump s inner circle Ms  Mayer stated that Fox News had buried a damaging story about Mr  Trump ahead of the 2016 election  the Fox executive involved said he blocked the reporting because he did not think it was journalistically sound  Ms  Mayer also cited unnamed sources who said they were told by a witness that Mr  Trump was fed questions ahead of a Fox sponsored primary debate in 2015  The network strongly denied that charge  and Ms  Kelly  who served as a debate moderator  has said she does not believe that her questions were leaked Mr  Perez said on Wednesday that Ms  Mayer s article  led me to conclude  that Fox News was not fit to sponsor an official candidate forum So far  the Democrats have announced two primary debates for their candidates  which will air in June on NBC News and in July on CNN  The decision to exclude Fox News was first reported by The Washington Post Executives at Fox News say they are open to sponsoring another televised town hall   albeit one without the imprimatur of the Democratic Party   in the coming months  The network is free to invite candidates to appear  and candidates are free to accept  Mr  Wallace  Mr  Baier and Ms  MacCallum have each interviewed Mr  Trump during his tenure Fox News did not sponsor a formal debate during the 2016 Democratic nominating process  but it did host a town hall featuring Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in March 2016  Mr  Baier served as moderator Relations between political parties and news networks are not always smooth  In 2016  Republican officials stripped a debate from NBC News after alleging that a previous event  conducted by the network s corporate sibling CNBC  was  petty and meanspirited in tone   according to the party s then chairman  Reince Priebus 
The Trump re election campaign s wireless open access proposal was a poorly vetted scheme possibly intended to score political points  It was squelched almost immediately after it became public  as shocked White House staff members complained that it contradicted the administration s support for competing wireless networks  The twist  Open access wireless is actually a terrific idea  Some forward thinking Democrats and public interest advocates have been pushing it for decades The concept  promoted by Republican operatives such as Newt Gingrich and Karl Rove  is for a network supporting fifth generation  5G  wireless technology to operate on a wholesale basis  Carriers such as AT T  Comcast and Verizon could buy capacity  So could anyone else  Apple  Amazon  Walmart  Uber or small operators serving rural areas  No company could use exclusive control over spectrum to block competition Last year  a leaked National Security Council presentation called for nationalization of 5G networks to improve cybersecurity and better compete against China  The proposal was ignominiously killed and its author left the White House  The Trump re election campaign s proposal wisely dropped the government takeover  It shifted the focus to wholesale access  which could be overseen by an independent nonprofit organization  like the independent system operators that manage electricity markets  Today s cellphones use fourth generation wireless technology  or 4G  5G  a set of standards under development  promises higher speeds  improved coverage and better support for new technologies such as augmented reality  autonomous vehicles and connected sensors in all types of devices  5G networks require denser construction of towers  reducing the distance between a tower and each device  To make 5G a reality  companies and consumers around the world will have to invest hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to upgrade hardware  phones and networks  The countries leading the way could reap huge economic benefits The December arrest in Canada of a top official of Huawei  China s biggest communications hardware provider  raised the stakes considerably  Meng Wanzhou is accused of committing fraud to help Huawei evade sanctions against Iran  The United States is pressuring its allies to ban Huawei from building their 5G networks on national security grounds Those moves will not  however  accelerate 5G deployment in the United States  The Chinese government aggressively coordinates and promotes 5G activity  which is proceeding at a breakneck pace  China Tower  for example  added 460 wireless tower sites per day in 2017  more than ten times the rate of American companies  according to a report by Deloitte relatedMore on 5GOpinion   Tim Wu  Should Trump Nationalize a 5G Network Jan  31  2018What 5G Will Mean for YouFeb  21  2016Opinion   Tom Wheeler  If 5G Is So Important  Why Isn t It Secure Jan  21  2019The view of American policymakers  which has been consistent through at least four administrations  is that competition among wireless operators is superior to heavy handed government initiatives  Nevermind that while American wireless providers have a strong track record on innovation  prices for consumers are high by global standards  and the so called free market is actually an oligopoly of four major carriers that could soon fall to three  Way back in 1995  a Columbia University economist  Eli Noam  proposed an alternative  a wholesale spectrum provider that sold capacity to all  Over the next few years  some progressives  myself included  argued that cable broadband networks should be subject to a similar open access mandate  And in 2010  as the Federal Communications Commission developed the National Broadband Plan  a team led by the Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler made a detailed case for wholesale sharing  The idea was shot down each time amid furious industry opposition  Why would the Trump campaign endorse open access  Rivada Networks  a politically connected firm that counts Peter Thiel  a prominent Trump donor  among its investors  appears to be positioning itself for the lucrative contract to provide the technology for such a system  Mr  Trump s political advisers see the open access plan as a way to improve wireless service in rural areas  a gift to the president s base These motivations should not obscure the value of open access  The communications industry has already shown that a competitive open market sometimes can t develop without government action  The F C C  had to prevent phone companies from squelching internet service providers  and many companies that develop online applications face potential blocking of their services and discrimination by broadband operators  The primary way the government makes wireless spectrum available today is through exclusive licensing to the highest bidder  That can make it difficult for companies that provide niche services such as telemedicine and smart electric grids  or that serve less populous areas  which the big national carriers often ignore Even some architects of the current system are reconsidering  Peter Cramton  for example  helped more than a dozen countries design spectrum auctions  He s now Rivada s chief economist  As Mr  Cramton and his co author  Linda Doyle  wrote in 2017  wholesale open access offers the best hope to break the wireless oligopoly while also using spectrum more efficiently They were right  Making capacity available in real time at market prices limits hoarding and encourages innovation  Unleashing our brilliant start up ecosystem through such market mechanisms  along with opportunities for unlicensed access to wireless capacity  is America s best hope to beat China in 5G But a poorly managed implementation could create a greedy wholesale monopolist  or turn wireless access into a political football  as is the disastrous fate of Australia s open access fiber network  And the details of implementation are not this administration s strong suit There is also no guarantee that rural wireless providers will rush in to take advantage of the opportunity  A wholesale system will require careful oversight and a long term commitment by the government  The political campaign s rapid walk back does not inspire confidence Nonetheless  tech savvy Democrats should welcome the embrace of their open access vision  Even if it means being more supportive of a Trump campaign position than the White House  Kevin Werbach  a professor at the

If you thought the past two years of inquiries into possible misbehavior by Trumpworld were brutal  brace yourself  Phase 2 is about to heat up On Monday  the Democratic led House Judiciary Committee announced a wide ranging inquiry into  the alleged obstruction of justice  public corruption and other abuses of power by President Trump  his associates and members of his administration  Citing two years of  near daily attacks on our basic legal  ethical and constitutional rules and norms  by the president  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the committee s chairman  asserted that  while it was important to respect the continuing criminal investigations  Congress  cannot rely on others to do the investigative work for us   With Republican lawmakers having abdicated their oversight duties when they controlled the House  Mr  Nadler said  Democrats must now  begin building the public record  As its opening move  Mr  Nadler s committee has sent requests for documents to 81 individuals and entities associated with Mr  Trump  including Donald Trump Jr   Eric Trump  Jared Kushner  Jeff Sessions  Hope Hicks  Paul Manafort  Steve Bannon and Roger Stone  The now defunct Trump Foundation is on the list  as is the Trump Organization  the Trump campaign  the White House and the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee  Also  David Pecker  the president s close friend and chairman of the parent company of The National Enquirer Look for the next several months to be a nonstop pageant of subpoenas  hearings and court challenges Mr  Nadler s panel is not alone in looking to impose accountability on a devious and dishonest president  But his investigation is special in at least one regard  As students of Congress   or of presidential scandals   can tell you  the House Judiciary Committee is where impeachment proceedings are born  And the areas on which Mr  Nadler will focus   obstruction of justice  public corruption and abuse of power   are precisely the sorts of high crimes and misdemeanors on which such cases are built Not that Mr  Nadler is raring to impeach  Many Democrats worry that an attempt to remove the president could prompt a political backlash  and no one wants to repeat what happened in 1998  when House Republicans  obsessive pursuit of President Bill Clinton contributed to the party taking an electoral beating Even as he prepared to start this investigation  Mr  Nadler sought to tamp down expectations   Impeachment is a long way down the road   he said Sunday in an ABC News interview  Political investigations tend to be marathons rather than sprints  requiring the slow  meticulous accretion of evidential layers  It s easy to forget how slowly and painfully the Watergate investigation unfolded  It was more than a year after John Dean s congressional testimony that President Richard Nixon resigned  With his investigation  Mr  Nadler is looking to build a case for impeachment so compelling that it will have enough bipartisan support to survive the Republican controlled Senate  Barring that  his investigation will serve to keep the heat on Mr  Trump  and perhaps keep the Democratic base at least somewhat placated  as the next election approaches  Mr  Nadler is right to telegraph restraint  This weekend  Kevin McCarthy  the top Republican in the House  said of Mr  Nadler s inquiry   I think Congressman Nadler decided to impeach the president the day the president won the election  Mr  Trump cavalierly dismissed the sweeping document request at a White House luncheon with the North Dakota State Bison football team on Monday   I cooperate all the time with everybody   he said   You know the beautiful thing   no collusion  It s all a hoax  Saturday  in a two hour speech before the Conservative Political Action Conference  Mr  Trump offered a more pungent take on his tormentors  using a vulgarity to describe the special counsel inquiry and calling the investigations  collusion delusion  But his core message remains the same  The president is perfectly content to burn down the nation to save his own hide It is unclear what new crimes or abuses Mr  Nadler s investigation might reveal  No matter how determined  Democrats in Congress lag far behind both the special counsel s office and the prosecutors of the Southern District of New York  Yet the House still has a vital role to play in educating the public on the legal and ethical questions spiraling around this president And there is much to illuminate  despite Mr  Trump s repeated assertion that  absent hard evidence of his having directly colluded with Russia to subvert an American election  he can declare vindication  Just last week  in his testimony about Mr  Trump before the House Oversight Committee  Michael Cohen  the president s longtime fixer and personal lawyer  detailed accusations of sleaziness and potential criminality that included tax fraud  bank fraud  wire fraud and conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws  Little of what Mr  Cohen shared was new  but it was important nonetheless  allowing the public its first opportunity to hear someone with intimate knowledge run through the catalog of the president s shameless and lawless behavior Look for Mr  Nadler s effort to bring many more such brutal spectacles as he seeks to build his case  This is what oversight looks like  It is not for the faint of heart

President Trump has tried to halt the arrival of undocumented migrants by beefing up border security  limiting who qualifies for asylum and  for a while  separating migrant children from their parents at the border  However  figures released on Tuesday suggest that those measures are failing to deter tens of thousands of migrants from journeying over land to the United States Indeed  after shriveling to the smallest total in five decades  the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border   the best indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the United States   is soaring again Border authorities detained nearly twice as many migrants   268 044   in the first five months of the fiscal year that started in October than were detained in the same period the previous year To understand what s happening  it s important to look at who is coming  what is driving them and how the answers to those questions have changed over the years   Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  It used to be about Mexico  But no more In the past  undocumented immigrants were overwhelmingly single men from Mexico who slipped into the country undetected to find work and send money home  But immigration from Mexico has plummeted in recent years  In fact  more Mexicans are leaving than arriving in the United States  Mexicans are less compelled to come because there are more opportunities in their own country and they have smaller families to support Central American families have become the new face of undocumented immigration In the first five months of the fiscal year that began in October  the Border Patrol detained 136 150 people traveling in families with children  compared with 107 212 during all of fiscal 2018 A trend toward family migration from Central America that began when Barack Obama was president has endured  after temporarily dipping during Mr  Trump s first year in office   More than 76 000 migrants cross in a month  Read about the  breaking points   Poverty is driving much of the latest migrationMany Central Americans live in fear  El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala have among the world s highest homicide rates  Arriving migrants report that they have faced extortion  and want to prevent their children from being recruited by street gangs But murder rates in the Northern Triangle countries have been declining in recent years  and economic imperatives are believed to be the most important push factor for the majority of recent arrivals  More than 90 percent of the most recent migrants are from Guatemala  according to the newly released data  The majority hail from impoverished regions  including the Western highlands  where conflicts over land rights  environmental changes and depressed prices for crops like maize and coffee are undermining the ability of farmers to make a living  Read about the treatment of detainees with medical conditions  Traveling with children is helping migrants avoid detentionMigrants generally lack understanding of United States immigration law  But they appear to be informed about the basics The majority know to request asylum at the border  either at an official port of entry or when they surrender to border agents shortly after sneaking into the country from Mexico They know that they are unlikely to remain detained if they travel with a child and that they have a better shot at fending off deportation when they come with a child By law  the government cannot keep migrant families in holding facilities at the border for more than 72 hours  It must either transfer them to an immigration detention facility suitable for children or release them  The government has been letting thousands of detained migrants go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention facilities  Immigration and Customs Enforcement s three residential family centers   two in southern Texas and one in Pennsylvania   can accommodate 3 326 parents and children The largest share of migrants arrive in Texas  but there appears to be a growing number who are entering through remote areas of Arizona and New Mexico Zero tolerance didn t workIn the spring of 2018  the Trump administration tried to discourage parents from traveling with a child by prosecuting everyone who crossed the border illegally  even those who were traveling with children   a policy known as zero tolerance  This resulted in children being removed from their parents and placed in shelters across the country The policy drew widespread condemnation  prompting the president to halt the practice in late June  But Customs and Border Protection officials believe that the various legal rulings preventing families from being detained have helped solidify the message to smugglers  who roam villages offering to guide people to the United States  that adults who come with a child are protected from deportation It s not that easy to get asylum  thoughWhether they sneak into the country in remote areas or enter the country through a port of entry  most migrants are trying to petition for asylum In 2008  just under 5 000 applicants claimed they had a credible fear of persecution  the first legal step toward obtaining asylum  to avoid being returned to their homeland  Last year  nearly 100 000 claimed a credible fear The Trump administration contends that people are flooding the asylum system with invalid claims  In recent years  immigration judges have granted less than 20 percent of asylum requests  a proportion that is even lower for Central Americans Many asylum seekers from Central America claim they have been victims of gangs  which is harder to prove than political and other types of persecution  Poverty is not among the grounds for receiving asylum If they are denied  asylum seekers can be deported  But since many are released while their case is pending  some never return to court and evade deportation  
WASHINGTON   Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  on Wednesday tersely defended a now defunct Trump administration practice of separating migrant children from their families at the border  sidestepping whether she supported it as a way to deter illegal immigration In tense exchanges with House Democrats  Ms  Nielsen instead implored Congress to confront what she called a  humanitarian catastrophe  on the southern border by changing laws to crack down on illegal border crossings She also said the Trump administration s family separation practice was similar to those of previous presidents   even if only sporadically enforced in earlier cases  It was a policy by this administration that only ended when there were pictures of little kids in cages that had been ripped away from their parents   Representative Kathleen Rice  Democrat of New York  told Ms  Nielsen during a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee Ms  Nielsen replied that Ms  Rice mischaracterized the administration s enforcement  That s a policy   Ms  Rice said   You should admit it  Ms  Nielsen noted that parents are generally separated from their children when they go to jail for illegal activities  But  that wasn t the point  of the immigration policy  she said  The point was to increase prosecutions for those breaking the law   she added  Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  The hearing was Ms  Nielsen s first since Democrats took control of the House this year  She backed President Trump s request to declare a national emergency at the border   which would give him access to funding to build a border wall   and cited new data from her department showing that the number of immigrants entering the United States illegally had doubled from a year ago Immigration officials are on track to apprehend one million people crossing the southern border this year  Ms  Nielsen said  This is not a manufactured crisis   Ms  Nielsen said   This is truly an emergency  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  later accused Democrats of refusing to acknowledge a crisis at the border  She also chastised Senate Republicans who did not support the president s emergency declaration  If you had done what you were elected to do on the front end  then the president would not have to fix the problem on his own through a national emergency   Ms  Sanders said Some Republicans at the House hearing said they supported building a wall along the border Representative Daniel Crenshaw  Republican of Texas  acknowledged the concerns about family separations but said physical barriers were crucial to securing the long stretches of land between ports of entry Mr  Crenshaw said he now doubted that  we all value the rule of law and value the ability to manage our border effectively    a view he admitted was cynical The Department of Homeland Security has opened three investigations into the Trump administration s immigration policies  the agency s acting inspector general  John V  Kelly  said in a separate hearing on Wednesday Mr  Kelly said one investigation is looking into the department s systems for tracking migrant children separated from their families  another is examining whether asylum seeking families are being separated at the border Department investigators were also reviewing whether parents facing deportation were given the option of bringing their children back home with them  In the hearing with Ms  Nielsen  Ms  Rice asked whether every relative facing deportation was  in fact  allowed to do so  To the best of my knowledge  every parent was afforded that option   Ms  Nielsen said In the past  most undocumented immigrants entering the United States from Mexico were single men looking for work  But over the past year  the number of migrants traveling together as a family has soared   a point that Ms  Nielsen sought to underscore Officials have said migrants   and the smugglers who exploit them   know they are unlikely to be detained if they travel with a child Under a court order  the government is prohibited from keeping children in holding facilities at the border for more than 72 hours  Children must either be transferred to immigration detention facilities suitable for minors  or be released The government has allowed thousands of detained migrants to go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention facilities  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  a branch of Ms  Nielsen s department  can accommodate only 3 326 parents and children in its three residential family centers Democrats also criticized Ms  Nielsen for not adequately keeping track of migrant children who were separated from their parents last year  You let kids be separated without tracking them  Do you know how outrageous that is  Madam Secretary   said Representative Nanette Barragán  Democrat of California   You have no feeling  no compassion  no empathy here  Ms  Nielsen did not respond The practice  part of a  zero tolerance  immigration policy that drew swift condemnation after it was publicly announced last spring  quickly became a symbol of the president s crackdown on illegal immigration  At the time  Ms  Nielsen repeatedly denied that her department had a policy of routinely separating migrant children from their parents at the border  despite mounting evidence that thousands of families had been broken apart During a news conference in June at the White House  she said she was offended by accusations that she would authorize separating children from their parents to send a message of deterrence  But the department continued to separate families until Mr  Trump  facing enormous public pressure  signed an executive order meant to end the policy Representative Bennie Thompson  Democrat of Mississippi and the committee s chairman  said he had requested documents on the treatment of asylum seekers at the border and family separations  After Wednesday s hearing  Mr  Thompson told reporters that he expected that information within a week and was prepared to use subpoena powers as a  last resort   The secretary can choose whether to be complicit in this administration s misinformation campaign   Mr  Thompson said   or she can correct the record  For much of her tenure  Ms  Nielsen has been the subject of Mr  Trump s ire over illegal immigration and border security Mr  Trump berated her privately for not doing enough to stop illegal immigration and accelerate construction of a wall along the border with Mexico  The president grew repeatedly angry with Ms  Nielsen for telling him that his ideas to stop immigration would be illegal or improper By year s end  reports were rampant that Mr  Trump wanted to fire Ms  Nielsen  but her credibility with the president has since improved  During the government s 35 day shutdown over funding for the president s border wall  Ms  Nielsen was a fierce advocate for the wall And on Wednesday morning  Ms  Nielsen made clear she would not stray far from the president s anti immigrant language  We face a crisis   a real  serious and sustained crisis at our borders   Ms  Nielsen said 
WASHINGTON   After a White House meeting last July  President Trump and Jean Claude Juncker  the European Commission president  stepped into the Rose Garden and proclaimed they had a trade deal or  at the very least  the makings of a future pact Eight months later  it is increasingly obvious that the two leaders had nothing close to that level of agreement American and European negotiators are at odds over what to include in a prospective trade deal  ratcheting up trans Atlantic tensions and jeopardizing talks before they even begin  Trump administration officials insist that any deal must address the agricultural trade barriers that the president says put American farmers at a disadvantage  in part because such an agreement would be more likely to win congressional approval  European officials counter that agriculture was never on the table   not last July  and not now  It should cover industrial goods  and that s it   Cecilia Malmstrom  the European trade commissioner  said in Bucharest  Romania  last month   We are not talking about agriculture  The United States disagrees  Top Trump administration officials say agriculture was always going to be part of the trade equation  even if that is not what the president and Mr  Juncker initially agreed to in their meeting  We were aware of that issue from Day 1   Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  said in an interview last week  The United States always assumed agriculture would be included in any deal  he said  adding   You re not going to have a far reaching E U  trade deal without agriculture  The competing narratives of what European and American officials agreed to cover in trade talks are the latest spat between traditional allies whose relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades  Mr  Trump has imposed stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union  prompting Europe to retaliate with levies on American orange juice  motorcycles and tobacco  The president has taken to criticizing the European Union s trade practices and its treatment of American farmers as being  even worse  than China s  And Mr  Trump continues to threaten Europe with tariffs on imported autos and auto parts The threat of auto tariffs is what got Mr  Juncker to the negotiating table  according to Mr  Trump  The president views the tariffs   which would be particularly harmful for German automakers   as his key to unlocking what he wants from Europe  namely more access for American beef  chicken  dairy and wine  We re trying to make a deal   Mr  Trump said at the White House last month   They re very tough to make a deal with  the E U  If we don t make the deal  we ll do the tariffs  But while Mr  Trump sees the car tariffs as leverage  the Europeans see them as a bomb that could shatter negotiations  If there ever were to be the unilateral imposition of tariffs  the talks would be ended   David O Sullivan  the departing European Union ambassador to the United States  said late last month The two sides are trying to move forward  Ms  Malmstrom met with Robert Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  on Wednesday  while Mr  Kudlow and Martin Selmayr  the European Commission s secretary general  will convene on Thursday Mr  Trump technically has until mid May to make a decision on the auto tariffs  though legal experts say he could continue to delay as long as talks continue  The Commerce Department  which has been studying the tariffs  sent a report with its findings to the White House on Feb  17 The details have not been made public  but a draft that circulated in early February determined that auto imports threatened the United States  national security  according to one person who viewed it  Such a finding would pave the way for Mr  Trump to impose across the board tariffs  The report also presented other actions the president could take to stem imports  including trade barriers focused exclusively on autonomous vehicles and parts  according to several people familiar with the findings Mr  Trump had prioritized restarting trade talks with the Europeans as part of his global push to negotiate deals on his own terms  But as the president dangled the threat of tariffs last July  the Americans and the Europeans were not sure they could even reach an agreement to begin negotiating The night before the July 25 Rose Garden ceremony  Mr  Kudlow and Mr  Selmayr met over Diet Cokes at the Hay Adams hotel near the White House  Mr  Kudlow had been encouraged by common interests between the United States and Europe  particularly a European offer to import large volumes of natural gas and soybeans The next day  the two sides worked furiously to iron out a statement outlining the scope of a trade deal  Mr  Kudlow shuffled drafts of the joint statement back and forth between the Americans and the Europeans  who were holed up in separate rooms in the White House  The Americans inserted agriculture into the draft  only to watch the Europeans take it out  according to one person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly  The two sides finally settled on the phrase  open markets for farmers and workers   which the Europeans say referred only to the bloc s offer to buy American soybeans Image You re not going to have a far reaching E U  trade deal without agriculture   said Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesMr  Trump had raised the issue of agriculture in his meeting with Mr  Juncker  according to people present  who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly  But when Mr  Juncker made clear that a negotiation that included agriculture would also include other hard to resolve issues  the president acquiesced  I m a results man   Mr  Trump said  arguing for a quicker turnaround The scope of the deal was announced but  almost immediately  American negotiators began lobbying to get agriculture back into the mix The day after the announcement  Mr  Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  told a Senate committee that he would not recommend negotiating a trade deal with the European Union without agriculture   Our view is that we are negotiating about agriculture  period   Mr  Lighthizer said   That s part of the process  Mr  Trump s advisers now say the initial announcement was an attempt to reap what they call an  early harvest   and circle back later for a more comprehensive deal  But some analysts say Mr  Trump s penchant for announcing victory before the details are finalized is now coming back to haunt him  It clearly frustrated the president s advisers  who apparently did not expect him to give that one away   wrote William Reinsch  the Scholl chair in international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington Mr  Kudlow said that American negotiators knew what they were trading and that they were just hoping to get the talks restarted  We decided to take what we could get   in effect reopening E U  trade talks   Mr  Kudlow said   And don t forget  looming in the background was the issue of auto tariffs  Agriculture accounts for less than 2 percent of the European Union s gross domestic product  but the sector is heavily subsidized  It also reliably stirs emotions among European voters and mobilizes public opposition Farmers are a powerful and militant constituency  especially in France  which is Europe s biggest producer of agricultural products and the biggest recipient of European Union subsidies Emmanuel Macron  the French president  is struggling with mass protests against his plans to overhaul the French economy  and farmers are already restive  Last week  they rumbled through cities like Bordeaux and Nantes in convoys of tractors and blocked a highway interchange near Lyon  They were protesting a trade deal being negotiated with several South American countries that  according to some reports  would allow more beef imports Even Europeans who live in cities are often sympathetic to farmers  who are seen as custodians of a rural way of life  In many countries  food is closely linked with national identity Parmesan cheese from Italy  Ibérico ham from Spain and many other products are protected by trademarks reserved exclusively for the regions that produce them  Farmers and consumers fear an influx of American products  which suffer generally from the perception  often false  that they contain more pesticides  hormones or artificial ingredients than European products The European Union and the United States have long recognized the need to present a united front on global trade practices  especially as China s power and influence have grown But despite deep cultural and historic ties  the American European trade partnership has not been easy  The two sides have squabbled for decades over differences in farm subsidies  food safety standards  government procurement practices and retaliatory tariffs   including the United States  25 percent tariff on foreign trucks  a legacy of a 1960s trade fight Those differences slowed talks over the Trans Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  a prospective Obama era trade deal that was scrapped when Mr  Trump came into office The experience of negotiating that pact taught the two sides a valuable lesson  A deal that involved agriculture and other thorny issues would be time consuming  while one focused on industrial goods could be done quickly  Mr  O Sullivan said  This is not an accident   he said of the agreement reached last summer European political leaders and legislators are expected within weeks to give Ms  Malmstrom a formal mandate to negotiate with the United States  Europe has already more than doubled its imports of American soybeans since Mr  Trump and Mr  Juncker met in July But many European political leaders are livid at Mr  Trump for  in their view  undermining the trans Atlantic alliance and damaging the European economy when it is already vulnerable  They are not in a mood to give Mr  Trump a victory  The current U S  attitude is   We want this  this and this  and if not  beware of the consequences    said Marietje Schaake  a member of the European Parliament s delegation for relations with the United States 
ISLAMABAD  Pakistan   Pakistan said on Tuesday that it would take new steps to seize and freeze the assets of people and militant groups who are on the United Nations  list of designated terrorists  after months of international criticism The announcement came as India and Pakistan were still on edge after a suicide bombing in Kashmir last month led to a military clash between the two  And last month  a financial watchdog group  the Paris based Financial Action Task Force  said Pakistan was still not taking enough concrete steps to curb financing and money laundering by terrorist groups Pakistan risks being blacklisted by the task force  which would open the door to international sanctions that would be devastating to the country s already teetering economy Pakistan s military has long been accused by its neighbors and Western countries of cultivating militant groups to use as proxies  including the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar e Taiba  which was widely accused of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed more than 160 people The financial task force demanded more action in particular against Lashkar e Taiba and against Jaish e Muhammad  a militant group that claimed responsibility for the Feb  14 bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers  There is a total consensus across all state institutions that these religious militias of all kinds represent a liability from the 1990s  a baggage of the past   Moeed Pirzada  an analyst and television news host who has been briefed by civilian and military officials  said in an interview on Tuesday   They don t serve any purpose and need to be absorbed into mainstream society through alternate job creation  Mr  Pirzada said the main challenge was to make inroads against such groups by taking over the religious schools  hospitals and relief organizations that they operate as fronts  Prime Minister Imran Khan s government made some budgetary allowances for those actions in December  he said India Pakistan Crisis  Why They Keep Fighting Over KashmirA simple guide to the roots of the conflict and what could happen next  An American cricket club carries on despite India Pakistan tensions  On Tuesday  Pakistani officials promised to take stronger action in the coming weeks against militant groups that operate inside Pakistani territory Pakistan has made those promises before  including when it was put on the financial task force s so called gray list early last year  at the request of the Trump administration But Pakistani officials say that there is greater urgency now  and that Mr  Khan s administration is worried about becoming an international pariah if it fails to act  On Monday evening  Mr  Khan gave a rare background briefing to news show hosts in which he reportedly emphasized that the time had come to do more to crack down on militant groups Pakistani officials say they plan to freeze the assets of more groups  and to take control of religious seminaries that are affiliated with them  The officials said that more travel restrictions would also be imposed on militant leaders In an initial sign of a crackdown  the Pakistani authorities have detained 44 people  including the brother and son of Masood Azhar  the chief of Jaish e Muhammad  Shehryar Afridi  the state minister for interior  who announced the move during a news conference in Islamabad  did not specify any charges and said the detentions were meant for investigations Mr  Afridi said the names of Mufti Abdur Raoof  the brother of Mr  Azhar  and Hammad Azhar  the son of Mr  Azhar  were included in a dossier that Indian authorities handed to Pakistan for investigations into the Feb  14 Kashmir attack Azam Suleman Khan  the interior secretary  said those detained would be freed if found innocent   In case we don t find any evidence against them  we will release them   Mr  Khan said As Pakistan continued to extend gestures that it wanted normalization of ties  its Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Sohail Mehmood  the country s ambassador to India  would return to New Delhi to resume his duties  The ambassador was recalled to Islamabad last month after tensions erupted over the Kashmir attack Pakistan also said on Tuesday that a delegation would visit India on March 14 to discuss a draft agreement on a Sikh pilgrimage corridor between the estranged neighbors  The Pakistani visit will be followed by a reciprocal Indian visit  officials said 
The number of migrant families crossing the southwest border has once again broken records  with unauthorized entries nearly double what they were a year ago  suggesting that the Trump administration s aggressive policies have not discouraged new migration to the United States More than 76 000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February  an 11 year high and a strong sign that stepped up prosecutions  new controls on asylum and harsher detention policies have not reversed what remains a powerful lure for thousands of families fleeing violence and poverty  The system is well beyond capacity  and remains at the breaking point   Kevin K  McAleenan  commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  told reporters in announcing the new data on Tuesday The nation s top border enforcement officer painted a picture of processing centers filled to capacity  border agents struggling to meet medical needs and thousands of exhausted members of migrant families crammed into a detention system that was not built to house them   all while newcomers continue to arrive  sometimes by the busload  at the rate of 2 200 a day  This is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis   Mr  McAleenan said  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border   a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next

but a humanitarian challenge created as thousands of migrant families surge into remote areas where the administration has so far failed to devote sufficient resources to care for them  as is required under the law The latest numbers stung an administration that has over the past two years introduced a rash of aggressive policies intended to deter migrants from journeying to the United States  including separating families  limiting entries at official ports and requiring some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico through the duration of their immigration cases More than 50 000 adults are currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody  the highest number ever Despite targeted successes in certain areas   about 2 000 migrants who traveled in a caravan from Central America last year appeared to have given up their cause as of last month after being discouraged by long delays in Tijuana   migrants seem only to have adjusted their routes rather than turn back  Indeed  they are traveling in even larger numbers than before  Read more about why more migrants are crossing the border  Arrests along the southern border have increased 97 percent since last year  the Border Patrol said  with a 434 percent increase in the El Paso sector  which covers the state of New Mexico and the two westernmost counties of Texas  Families  mainly from Central America  continue to arrive in ever larger groups in remote parts of the southwest At least 70 such groups of 100 or more people have turned themselves in at Border Patrol stations that typically are staffed by only a handful of agents  often hours away from civilization  By comparison  only 13 such groups arrived in the last fiscal year  and two in the year before Understanding what is happening on the border is difficult because  while the numbers are currently higher than they have been in several years  they are nowhere near the historic levels of migration seen across the southwest border  Arrests for illegally crossing the border reached up to 1 64 million in 2000  under President Clinton  In the 2018 fiscal year  they reached 396 579  For the first five months of the current fiscal year  268 044 have been apprehended ImageMigrants from Central America turned themselves in to Border Patrol agents in Penitas  Tex   last month CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe difference is that the nature of immigration has changed  and the demographics of those arriving now are proving more taxing for border officials to accommodate  Most of those entering the country in earlier years were single men  most of them from Mexico  coming to look for work  If they were arrested  they could quickly be deported Now  the majority of border crossers are not single men but families   fathers from Honduras with adolescent boys they are pulling away from gang violence  mothers with toddlers from Guatemala whose farms have been lost to drought  While they may not have a good case to remain in the United States permanently  it is not so easy to speedily deport them if they arrive with children and claim protection under the asylum laws Families with children can be held in detention for no longer than 20 days  under a much debated court ruling  and since there are a limited number of detention centers certified to hold families  the practical effect is that most families are released into the country to await their hearings in immigration court  The courts are so backlogged that it could take months or years for cases to be decided  Some people never show up for court at all Finally  detaining families even for the first few days after their arrival in the United States  while they are undergoing initial processing  is also a challenging job Often arriving exhausted  dehydrated  and some of them requiring urgent medical care  the families need food  diapers  infant formula and space to play  They can often spend days inside cramped concrete cells that were built to house the previous generation of border crossers   young  single men who would likely be there only a few hours As part of the announcements on Tuesday  Mr  McAleenan also said the agency is making sweeping changes to procedures for guaranteeing adequate medical care for migrants   an overhaul brought on by the deaths of two migrant children in the agency s custody in December  The measures  which include comprehensive health screenings for all migrant children and a new processing center in El Paso that would help provide better shelter and medical care for migrant families  are an attempt to fix years of health care inadequacies that have left many at risk The agency will also expand medical contracts to place health care practitioners   largely registered nurses and nurse practitioners   in  high risk  and high traffic locations along the border  It will also dedicate more money for translation services to meet increasing demand from Central Americans  many of whom speak indigenous languages and dialects and may not be able to communicate their needs in English or Spanish ImageA migrant child from Honduras at a shelter in El Paso  Tex  As of March 3  237 327 migrants had been apprehended along the southwest border since the fiscal year began in October  a 97 percent increase from the previous year CreditSara Naomi Lewkowicz for The New York Times Read  Border Patrol Facilities Put Detainees With Medical Conditions at Risk  These solutions are temporary and this situation is not sustainable   Mr  McAleenan said Mr  McAleenan said the authorities believe that the large numbers of families are coming because smugglers have effectively communicated across Central America that adults who travel with children will be allowed to enter and stay in the United States Brian Hastings  the agency s chief of law enforcement operations  said that since April 2018  border agents had detected nearly 2 400  false families   including cases in which migrants had falsely claimed to be related when they were not  or untruthfully claimed to be younger than 18 The throngs of new families are also affecting communities on the American side of the border  In El Paso  a volunteer network that temporarily houses the migrants after they are released from custody has had to expand to 20 facilities  compared with only three during the same period last year  Migrants are now being housed in churches  a converted nursing home and about 125 hotel rooms that are being paid for with donations  We had never seen these kinds of numbers   said Ruben Garcia  the director of the organization  called Annunciation House  He said that during one week in February  immigration authorities had released more than 3 600 migrants to his organization  the highest number in any single week since the group s founding in 1978 For the most part  Mr  Garcia said that his staff and volunteer workers had been able to keep up with the surge  often making frantic calls to churches to request access to more space for housing families on short notice  But sometimes their best efforts were upended  he said  including on one day last week  when the authorities dropped off 150 more migrants than planned  We just didn t have the space   Mr  Garcia said 
Yemen s deputy culture minister  Abdulhadi al Azazi  remembers standing two years ago amid the rubble of a national museum in his war torn hometown  Taiz Objects he had admired as a youngster   ancient limestone carvings  gilded Torah scrolls  bejeweled Islamic daggers  a spindly 2 500 year old mummy   were missing amid the charred debris and shattered display cases  The museum was wrecked and everything was stolen   he said in a telephone interview   Everywhere in our country we see the same thing happening now  Some four years into a civil war in which members of a Northern Yemeni faction known as Houthis have fought Saudi backed Yemeni forces to a stalemate  the extent of the human suffering has drawn global attention  Less noticed have been the cultural institutions and archaeological relics lost or ravaged during the conflict  including thousands of antiquities taken from Yemen s museums  Read more about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen  In an effort to recover some of the items  Yemeni officials visited Washington and New York in recent days to ask the Trump administration and the United Nations to help them forestall the scattering of a heritage that stretches back nearly 4 000 years  Their central request is that the United States issue an emergency order that would bar the import of Yemeni artifacts that did not carry special documentation Typically  antiquities from abroad cannot enter the country without documentation mandated in one on one agreements between the nation of origin and the United States  Because Yemen is not party to any such agreement  its artifacts simply need to be declared at customs in a routine way The Saudi backed Yemeni government hopes the United States will impose new rules requiring importers to show proof that the objects had been legally obtained  That proof could be in the form of a government authorization or documents proving that the items had a well established provenance trail dating from before the civil war  Yemen was a cradle to many civilizations and a home to multiple faiths  particularly Judaism  Christianity and Islam  which all thrived here   Yemen s culture minister  Marwan Dammaj  said in New York on Wednesday  He denounced the pillaging as  a gross affront to humanity at large  ImageMarwan Dammaj  the culture minister of Yemen  at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Wednesday CreditJohannes BergRestrictions on antiquity imports are usually painstakingly negotiated and require a petitioning nation to show proof of ongoing thefts  illegal excavations and illicit exports  Care is taken not to disrupt any legal trade in a country s cultural heritage objects  or to interfere with museum loans and educational exchanges  Nations seeking the curbs must show they are working to crack down on black markets and safeguard their relics Nonetheless  the United States has in recent years issued emergency orders on behalf of Iraq  Syria  Libya and Mali  In the case of Syria  for example  Congress voted to impose the restrictions in 2016 after terrorist groups were found to be profiteering from the country s antiquities to pay for weapons and recruitment The Yemenis say they have strong evidence that their artifacts are being sold off by Houthi fighters and by terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State  which infiltrated the country during its current turmoil  To bolster those claims  Mr  Dammaj circulated a 290 page report in Arabic and English that details the looting at the Aden National Museum  the Taiz National Museum and the National Museum of Zinjibar ImageThe marble head of a horse  thought to have been created between 1 000 B C  and 800 B C   that was taken from the Zinjibar Museum in Yemen CreditYemen Culture MinistryAccompanying it is a catalog of 1 631 objects missing from the museums  The list includes items that stretch back into the depths of civilization in a region known as a vital early trading crossroads  including ivory figurines from the ancient Kingdom of Saba  the mythic realm of the Queen of Sheba   Roman era golden coins and marble statuettes  and brass finials and Hebrew manuscripts from the many centuries when Jews populated what is now southern Arabia  It is clear that violent extremists are plundering our treasures and smuggling them overseas   said Mr  Dammaj  who met with State and Treasury Department officials  American law enforcement authorities and United Nations representatives State Department officials said the agency is studying the request  It is important that we take steps now to prevent the further degradation of invaluable cultural property and heritage sites in Yemen   the department said in a statement   We want to help prevent malign actors from profiting from the looting  theft and sale of conflict antiquities  ImageAlso reported stolen from the Zinjibar Museum  this limestone sculpture is thought to date from 1000 to 800 B C   during the time of the Kingdom of Saba CreditYemen Culture MinistryMr  Dammaj said Houthis have been arrested several times in the act of smuggling antiquities and have been seen ransacking cultural sites Although it is impossible to corroborate every allegation  independent groups that follow Yemen s plight have also cited a Houthi role in the sacking of some cultural sites  Mwatana  an independent Yemeni human rights group  has cited those forces in the looting of several museums  though it has also accused Saudi air forces of bombing cultural sites where they believed Houthi combatants had taken shelter Last month  the Malaysia based Islamic Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization assailed the Houthis for plundering manuscripts  historical texts and Islamic relics from the library of Zabid  Yemen s capital during the 13th and 15th centuries Deborah Lehr  the chairwoman of the Antiquities Coalition  a Washington group that combats cultural racketeering and helped Yemen assemble and publish the English language version of its report  said her group had been in contact with foreign archaeologists on the ground in Yemen who reported evidence of looting by the Houthi faction 
A prominent Iranian lawyer who defended women arrested when they defied Iran s head covering rule has been convicted of security related crimes in a secret trial and could face a  very lengthy sentence   a human rights monitoring group reported Wednesday The group  the Center for Human Rights in Iran  said it had learned of the conviction of the lawyer  Nasrin Sotoudeh  from her husband  She was seized at her home by security agents last June and placed in Evin Prison in Tehran Ms  Sotoudeh  55  who has been in and out of Iranian prisons several times  is an international symbol of defiance to the limits on personal and political freedoms imposed by the Islamic Republic s religious hierarchy  She won Europe s most prestigious human rights award  the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought  in 2012 The Iranian authorities have never specified why they seized her in June  but at the time Ms  Sotoudeh was defending women arrested when they removed their hijabs  or Islamic head scarves  in public protests Ms  Sotoudeh may also have angered the judicial authorities by publicly criticizing their decision to limit legal representation for defendants in political cases to a list of 20 state approved lawyers  Ms  Sotoudeh was not on that list  No amount of spin will be able to conceal the fact that Sotoudeh is being persecuted for her peaceful defense of human rights in Iran  including a woman s right to choose whether to wear a hijab   said Hadi Ghaemi  the executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran  which is based in New York Last September  Ms  Sotoudeh was tried in a Revolutionary Court in Tehran but refused to appear because she could not choose her lawyer  according to an account posted on the website of Mr  Ghaemi s group Her husband  Reza Khandan  was sentenced to six years in January for illicitly posting updates about his wife s case on Facebook  but he has yet to be imprisoned on that charge  Mr  Ghaemi said  The couple have two young children Mr  Ghaemi said Mr  Khandan had told him his wife recently requested from prison that a lawyer of her own choosing be allowed to examine the case file against her  The request was denied  Mr  Ghaemi quoted him as saying  because  the verdict has been issued and the case is closed  While the details have not been disclosed  Mr  Ghaemi said  at least seven charges are believed to have been lodged against Ms  Sotoudeh  They included collusion against national security  anti state propaganda  membership in illicit groups  appearing before the judiciary without the required head covering  disturbing the peace  publishing falsehoods to disturb public opinion  and  encouraging corruption and prostitution   Each charge has many years   Mr  Ghaemi said   It could be a very lengthy sentence  Ms  Sotoudeh s conviction has not been reported in official Iranian news media  There was no immediate response to a request for comment from Iran s United Nations mission in New York The prosecution of Ms  Sotoudeh has come against the backdrop of a resurgence of influence by the most hard line elements of Iran s leadership  particularly since the Trump administration took office two years ago President Trump has moved aggressively to ostracize Iran  renouncing the nuclear agreement it reached with the Obama administration and five other world powers  and reimposing sanctions that the accord had eased in return for Iran s peaceful nuclear development Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  Iran s supreme leader  has said the Trump administration s policies proved his longstanding suspicion that the United States could not be trusted   a view that may have emboldened the hard liners in the government and weakened President Hassan Rouhani  who is considered a relative moderate The National Iranian American Council  a Washington based group that advocates for improved relations with Iran but is highly critical of the country s human rights record  said it was appalled by news of Ms  Sotoudeh s conviction and called for her immediate release Jamal Abdi  the council s president  said in a statement that responsibility for Ms  Sotoudeh s incarceration  lies squarely with the Iranian authorities   But he also pointed a finger at the Trump administration  As hard liners seek to match Trump s bellicosity and undermine moderates and the will of the Iranian people   Mr  Abdi said   human rights proponents like Sotoudeh often become the first victims  
WASHINGTON   Patriot Puck  a New York based company  wrapped its hockey pucks in American flags  declaring them  The Only American Made Hockey Puck  The mattress firm Nectar Sleep  founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs  promoted its mattresses as  designed and assembled in the U S A  Two California based manufacturers of deployment bags  tactical gear and other merchandise marketed to active and retired American military personnel sold the products online as  MadeInUSA  and inserted  American Made  tags into its products In reality  most of the products were manufactured entirely in China  according to the Federal Trade Commission Last fall  the F T C  determined that all four companies had violated federal law by engaging in  unfair or deceptive acts  and falsely marketing their goods as American made But while President Trump has accused China of destroying American jobs and prioritized strengthening United States manufacturing  his appointees at the F T C  did little to punish the firms  The companies faced no fines and were not required to admit any wrongdoing or to notify customers of their false marketing  The trade commission entered into proposed consent agreements with each firm barring them from falsely marketing their products with the threat of fines if they violated the agreement  A final decision on the penalties is expected in the coming weeks after a public comment period ends The trade commission s treatment of the companies has angered Democratic lawmakers  who are urging the Trump administration to pursue tougher punishments for companies that profit by producing products in China and falsely labeling them as American made ImageA Nectar Sleep mattress  The company had labeled its products as  designed and assembled in the U S A   In reality they are mostly made in China CreditNectar Sleep We call on the commission to do more to protect American manufacturers and consumers   a group of senators wrote to the F T C  last month  Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut  Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin asked the agency to  provide specific insights about the commission s decision to seek no consequences in these brazen instances of fraudulently labeling goods as  Made in the USA   From the campaign trail to the White House  Mr  Trump has directed much of his focus to rebuilding American jobs and industries  In April 2017  Mr  Trump signed a  Buy American and Hire American  executive order  with the goal of promoting the use of  American made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job  Mr  Trump has put a particular focus on revitalizing American manufacturing  which he says has been decimated by cheap Chinese labor and materials That has Democrats questioning why the agency is not being more aggressive in going after American companies that manufacture their goods in China  Many companies that manufacture at home are already treading water   Rohit Chopra  a Democratic F T C  commissioner who disagreed with the decision  said in an interview   American companies shouldn t lose out to corporate cheaters who lie on their labels  Mr  Brown  who is considering running for president  said the agency s penalty did not match the severity of the companies  behavior  If companies that break our laws do not face financial penalties  then our American manufacturers are severely undermined   Mr  Brown said   We need stronger enforcement by the F T C  and greater transparency when it comes to the commission s actions to crack down on these violators  Some agency officials  including one of its two Democratic commissioners  defended the settlement  saying that the threat of future penalties was a strong deterrent  The companies face a  40 000 penalty per violation if they are caught making false claims again  And officials said the agency did not seek monetary relief  in part  because there was no  price premium   meaning the goods were not more expensive than similar products sold by competitors  who also imported their products but did not falsely label them as American made ImageMr  Trump focused on revitalizing American manufacturing and held a  Made in America  event at the White House last year CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times In our view  a thoughtful review and forward looking plan is a more effective and efficient use of commission resources than reopening and relitigating the cases before us today   Joseph J  Simons  the F T C  chairman  and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter  a Democratic commissioner  wrote in a statement in September But at least one company has complained to the commission  alleging in a letter that the backpack manufacturer s misleading claim cost it lucrative contracts  Sandpiper caused confusion to at least one organizational buyer at the Army and Air Force Exchange Service looking for  Made in the USA  products   Alan Watts  a lawyer representing a competing company  Advantus  wrote to the commission in October   This caused a very real unfair competitive disadvantage to Advantus whose compliance with the law caused it to lose sales  The F T C  has a long history of weak enforcement in  Made in America  cases that preceded Mr  Trump s tenure  The commission lists on its website 26  Made in America  cases it has reviewed since 1999  In some of those cases  companies have agreed to a monetary settlement  In 2016  for instance  Chemence  a specialty chemical company  agreed to pay  220 000 to resolve an agency lawsuit  But in many other cases  the settlements required only record keeping and reporting requirements to make sure companies did not violate the law again The commission first found out about the false  Made in America  claims made by the four companies in question now through a dedicated complaint line  according to James Kohm  associate director of the enforcement division for the Bureau of Consumer Protection Mr  Kohm  in an interview  noted that Patriot Pucks went out of business shortly after the F T C  s first ruling in September  and that Sandpiper  one of the tactical gear manufacturers  was sold to a new owner last fall while the company was involved in litigation with the commission  We ve reached a preliminary agreement  whereby the company has not been required to admit any liability   said a lawyer representing Piper Gear  the second tactical gear maker  He said he could not comment further because the settlement was not final After a public comment period  which included the questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill  the commission is expected to issue a final notice on the cases in the coming weeks  The senators  along with Mr  Chopra  are pressing to change the settlement to further penalize the wrongdoers  The commission should consider remedies tailored to the individual circumstances of the fraud  including redress and notice for consumers  disgorgement of ill gotten gains  opt in return programs  or admissions of wrongdoing   Mr  Chopra wrote in a dissenting statement 
Call them the announcements that weren t Over the past two days  Michael R  Bloomberg  the former New York City mayor  Eric H  Holder Jr   the former United States attorney general  and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon officially declared   drumroll  please   that they would not be running for president in 2020  A fourth Democrat  Hillary Clinton  also said  I m not running  to a New York City television station Such is the state of Democratic fervor to challenge President Trump that the party now has a subset of politicians  the almost rans Mr  Bloomberg said he felt his time and personal fortune would be better used promoting immigration reform and gun control and fighting climate change  Mr  Holder wants to continue focusing on ending gerrymandering  Mrs  Clinton  who never seriously pursued a third primary bid  said she would keep  standing up for what I believe   And Mr  Merkley will seek a third term in the Senate in 2020  after the State Legislature rejected his request to allow him to run for both positions simultaneously  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter   I have felt like I m sitting on a fence  and I m getting really uncomfortable sitting on those pickets   said Mr  Merkley in an interview   At some point  you just have to say   O K   I ve weighed it and reweighed and here s the right thing to do   But there are also other challenges and obstacles facing potential 2020 candidates right now The Oxygen ProblemThere are already 14 Democrats running for president  and there is a good chance that a 15th one could enter in the coming weeks  former Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   who would take up a significant share of the ever thinning oxygen in the packed race  Another big name  former Representative Beto O Rourke  is also expected to announce his presidential intentions soon Image I m not running   Hillary Clinton told a New York City television station   But I m going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe  CreditChang W  Lee The New York TimesMr  Biden and Mr  O Rourke would add enormous pressure to the competition among the candidates for aides  donations  volunteers  media attention and voter support  The primary race has already created at least one star  with Senator Kamala Harris  of California  attracting enthusiastic admirers who regularly express the hope that they are witnessing the party s  next Obama   While the four Democrats who just said no to 2020 did not appear intimidated by a Harris  Biden or O Rourke candidacy  building an organization and commanding attention only gets harder amid multiple star candidates There s also the looming deadline of March 31  when candidates must report their first quarter finances to the Federal Election Commission  Those returns will be scrutinized as an early show of relative strength   or weakness   in the race  There is a sense that if you re going to build a presidential team  if you re going to build the fund raising base  you re going to have to work night and day  and you can t wait forever to do that   said Mr  Merkley   There s a compelling sense of many people feeling like you ve got to decide by the end of the first quarter  Candidates who can self finance their campaigns  like Mr  Bloomberg  would still face a fierce competition to be heard  not only among others in the race but amid intensifying efforts by Democrats on Capitol Hill to investigate the Trump administration Even the first Democratic debate in June doesn t hold the promise of much airtime  Depending on how many candidates qualify  the event could become a two night affair  with candidates assigned a spot based on a random drawing The Billionaire ProblemIt didn t go unnoticed by Mr  Bloomberg that he was the last billionaire considering a bid for the Democratic nomination  Tom Steyer  the California liberal activist  opted against running earlier this year  and if the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz runs  he has said he would do so as an independent ImageEric H  Holder Jr   the former attorney general  said he wants to focus on his efforts to end gerrymandering CreditKrista Schlueter for The New York Times I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election   Mr  Bloomberg wrote in a column published Tuesday   But I am cleareyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field  Populist progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have made combating the influence of money in politics a core message of their presidential candidacies   arguments that might have proved challenging for Mr  Bloomberg  whose aides said he would spend at least  500 million of his own fortune to defeat President Trump in 2020 Mr  Bloomberg s moderate  pro business record and generally favorable view of Wall Street would likely also have posed problems in a party that has shifted left on economic issues like taxing the rich and regulating big banks  Some of those arguments could have posed challenges for Mrs  Clinton  too  who spent decades cultivating a network of high dollar donors and close relationships with Wall Street to fund her campaigns The Party ProblemDemocrats lost more than 1 000 seats in state legislatures and governorships during President Barack Obama s two terms in the Oval Office  and those defeats found increased scrutiny once Mr  Trump ascended into the presidency and the Democrats held diminished political power In the three years since  grass roots organizations and Democratic Party leaders have pledged to take recruitment and support for nonpresidential races more seriously  leading some candidates who had considered a run for president to look further down the ticket  In Mr  Merkley s video announcing that he would not run  he said   We need both strong leadership in the Oval Office and strong leadership in the Senate   a sentiment that was met with applause on social media  Stacey Abrams  the Georgia Democrat who lost her bid for governor in 2018  is being heavily recruited for another statewide race in Georgia    Mr  O Rourke  the charismatic Texas Democrat who is expected to run for president after losing a Senate bid in 2018  has also faced several calls to focus his energy at home  Who s in  Who s out  Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  Jeff Hauser  of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington  tweeted that other Democrats should take a page from Mr  Merkley s  principled and realistic playbook  and run for Senate   We need to address the climate crisis  confirm judges   Justices  and in general begin the process of De Trumpification   he wrote ImageSenator Jeff Merkley will run for re election in 2020  Oregon s State Legislature rejected his request to allow him to run for both president and Senate simultaneously CreditJose Luis Magana Associated PressMr  Bloomberg s non announcement announcement included plans to invest further in climate activism  which is another way Democrats are choosing to focus on the party s overall health  Mr  Steyer decided he would instead put his money behind efforts to impeach Mr  Trump Both Mr  Steyer and Mr  Bloomberg said that  unlike Mr  Schultz  they would not consider a third party run  which could risk helping Mr  Trump win re election by siphoning votes from the Democratic candidate The Newness ProblemAnother thing the four non candidates have in common  They all represent the back end of a rapidly changing Democratic Party After their defeat in the 2016 presidential election  a more liberal  more uncompromising wing of the party begin to emerge  desperate to throw off the institutional connections to more centrist figures like the Clintons and Mr  Obama  It was this wing that has helped move presidential candidates further to the left  pushing them to embrace policies like  Medicare for all   the Green New Deal and the rejection of corporate PAC money The new crop of Democrats are also more keen to talk about the importance of a candidate s identity  particularly millennials and nonwhite activists who are driving grass roots changes among Democrats    Anybody But a White Guy 2020   reads a popular sign at presidential rallies  And youth led social movements about sexual harassment  racial justice  and gun control in recent years have forced Democrats to answer uncomfortable questions about the lack of equitable representation among their caucus in terms of race  gender  and class Figures such as Mrs  Clinton  Mr  Bloomberg and Mr  Holder would have been an ideological mismatch for this emerging leftist voice  Mrs  Clinton already struggled to appease the party s left flank during her 2016 run  and the litmus test issues have only moved further from her core policy center since  Social justice activists were raring to challenge Mr  Holder on his record on police reform as head of Department of Justice Even Mr  Sanders seemed caught off guard during a recent appearance on The Breakfast Club  the urban radio show targeted to millennials  when a host asked him   Do we need another white guy as president

on the private sector and giving markets a bigger role  Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley of the NYT write 2019 is a  crucial year  for China s economy  Premier Li Keqiang  the second ranking official in the country after President Xi Jinping  said at the opening of the National People s Congress in Beijing this morning  He said the trade war with America had  had an adverse effect   adding   We must be fully prepared for a tough struggle   China has lowered its growth target for this year  Mr  Li said that the nation was now aiming for gross domestic product growth of 6 to 6 5 percent  down from a target of 6 5 percent over the past two years Other policy changes include a reduction in value added tax  which is expected to boost corporate earnings  And Mr  Li said the government would  act with resolve to hand matters it shouldn t manage over to the market  But Mr  Li s speech  did not go as far as domestic or foreign critics would have liked   Mr  Bradsher and Mr  Buckley write

with the U S Ghosn is finally granted bailA Tokyo court ruled today that the former auto industry leader Carlos Ghosn could post bail  months after he was charged with financial misconduct  The court set the bail at 1 billion yen  or about  9 million It was Mr  Ghosn s third bail request  but the first led by his new legal team  including the high profile defense lawyer Junichiro Hironaka  Prosecutors previously argued that Mr  Ghosn was a flight risk and might tamper with evidence The court imposed strict limits on Mr  Ghosn  including a ban on leaving Japan  surveillance outside his Tokyo residence and a pledge not to contact people beyond his legal team   The bail conditions are severe  but we will make sure to comply   Mr  Hironaka said The battle for bail highlighted Japan s use of what critics call  hostage justice   The FT writes that it  prolongs the detainment of defendants who  like Mr  Ghosn  assert their innocence and refuse to make a confession  Mr  Ghosn isn t

Trump investigations reach wideThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  Representative Jerry Nadler  issued a flurry of document requests yesterday to all corners of President Trump s world  It s the most sweeping effort yet by Democratic lawmakers to investigate the president for alleged misdeeds Mr  Nadler requested information from 81 people and agencies  including the Trump Organization  the Trump campaign  the Trump Foundation  the inaugural committee  the White House  and family members and aides  Other House committee chairs have requested documents related to Mr  Trump s communications with President Vladimir Putin of Russia Democrats are looking into possible violations of campaign finance law and use of office for personal gain  particularly where it might violate a

new ones  like Netflix  Who s in  Bob Greenblatt  the former head of NBC and Showtime  will be chairman of Warner Media Entertainment  Jeff Zucker  the current CNN chief  will oversee news and sports  And Kevin Tsujihara will continue to lead the Warner Bros  movie studio  along with a new division for family and kids  programming The battle has two fronts  AT T hopes 24 hour news and content like  Game of Thrones  will help it fend off telecom competitors  But it also wants to compete in streaming against giants like Netflix and Amazon  John Stankey  the head of Warner Media  told the NYT that the reorganization would speed the development of a new online video service The man in the hot seat is Mr  Greenblatt  who as HBO s new boss replaces Richard Plepler  the much admired former C E O  who resisted AT T s desire to make the network more like Netflix  Mr  Greenblatt defended AT T s approach  telling Vanity Fair that HBO would have to increase its output  because now we live in a

would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information   a Glass Steagall for the international  tech companies  Mr  Cicilline told the FT

that some companies could be forced to  spin off  previous acquisitions Defending share buybacksLawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to limit companies  ability to buy back their shares  But Josh Bolten  the C E O  of the Business Roundtable  and Ken Bertsch  the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors  write in an NYT Op Ed that such efforts could hurt the economy   Restricting buybacks and dividends  the two write  could force companies  to sit on cash or waste it on projects with a low potential for success     Some critics of buybacks miss this point  Money returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends does not disappear from the economy   Mr  Bolten and Mr  Bertsch add  citing individuals making big purchases  angel investments in new businesses and loans as potential uses of such cash    While there was a substantial increase in buybacks and dividends last year  business investment also increased substantially and grew at the fastest rate since 2011     Not only do buybacks and dividends support a stronger and more dynamic economy  they also contribute to Americans  retirement security   Mr  Bolten and Mr  Bertsch write  citing widespread stock ownership in American households   The two concede that buybacks could be abused and advocate companies having strong corporate governance  But they argue federal limitations

WASHINGTON   Federal regulators moved on Wednesday to ease oversight of the country s largest banks and other financial firms  continuing a push by the Trump administration to reverse rules that were put in place following the 2008 financial crisis The Federal Reserve said it would adjust the structure of its annual  stress tests   which measure the ability of leading banks to withstand a potential economic or financial storm  The changes are likely to make it easier for banks to get regulatory approval to pay higher dividends or buy back their own shares Separately  a federal oversight panel announced that it planned to no longer designate big  non bank financial institutions   insurers  asset managers and the like   as  systemically important   The classification subjected such firms to more intrusive government regulation Taken together  the announcements on Wednesday represented a big win for the financial industry  which has been arguing since the Obama administration that a flurry of regulations imposed following the financial crisis were onerous and made it harder for banks to make loans and support economic growth  Bank executives also argue that because the industry is much financially stronger than it was a decade ago many recent regulations are now unnecessary  Today s actions reflect the stability of the financial system and the Fed s growing experience with stress testing   said Jeff Sigmund  a spokesman for the American Bankers Association  which represents the nation s largest banks Critics  however  argued that the relaxation of the rules  while financially beneficial to bank shareholders and executives  will lead to a less safe  less transparent financial system that is more vulnerable to a repeat of last decade s devastating crisis  It s like if we all had to go to gym class and we all had to do the same things  now they re saying half of you don t even have to go  and the other half that have to go can do something easier   said Christopher Wolfe  a managing director at Fitch Ratings  which evaluates the creditworthiness of big companies   It s just another data point that reinforces the view that there s been a regulatory easing  The Trump administration has said that deregulation is a top priority  along with tax cuts and overhauling trade agreements  in its efforts to accelerate economic growth Soon after taking office  President Trump directed the Treasury Department to produce a series of reports with recommendations for regulatory changes  including watering down the 2010 Dodd Frank Act and the Volcker Rule  which barred banks from making trades with their own money In recent months  Fed officials have signaled growing interest in reassessing and lightening the regulatory burdens faced by big banks Jerome H  Powell  the Fed chairman  said during his Senate confirmation hearings that regulations on Wall Street banks were  tough enough  and suggested an appetite for streamlining post crisis rules  Late last year  Randal K  Quarles  the Fed s vice chairman for supervision  called for a more tailored approach to regulating financial institutions and suggested that the Fed might loosen rules governing the safety of their balance sheets The move on Wednesday by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to no longer treat non banks as systemically important is largely symbolic Only four financial institutions  including American International Group and MetLife  previously had that  too big to fail  designation  All of them argued successfully for the labels to be removed  Prudential Financial was the final firm to escape from the tougher regulation  after the oversight council concluded last fall that it no longer represented a threat to financial stability Going forward  the oversight panel said it would introduce a new system for identifying activities and products that could pose broad risks  The council said it would only designate a firm as  systemically important  if there was no other way to curb the risk it poses to the financial system by addressing its activities  Today s proposal would make significant improvements to how the council identifies  assesses  and responds to potential risks to U S  financial stability   Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  said in a statement The bigger change is the Fed s adjustments to how it conducts its stress tests of 11 of the biggest banks that received government bailouts in 2008 The Fed said on Wednesday that it would end its practice of awarding  pass  or  fail  grades to banks on a portion of the stress tests that measured the capacity of banks to keep lending during a financial crisis or economic downturn  This so called qualitative section of the test also measured the strength of their risk management and anti money laundering systems The stress tests will still have a pass fail component when it comes to gauging whether they have enough capital to keep functioning properly during a simulated financial emergency Bank executives have been exasperated by the stress tests  complaining that the qualitative section in particular relies on regulators  subjective judgment The Fed s planned changes are  an attempt to be sensitive to how time consuming and resource oriented these regulatory testing processes are   said Evan Stewart  a partner at the law firm Cohen   Gresser The stress tests have tripped up a number of big banks  The Fed in 2014 shot down Citigroup s plans to return money to shareholders after it failed the qualitative section  The following year  Deutsche Bank and the Spanish bank Santander failed  while Bank of America barely eked out a passing grade The end of the pass fail grades  reduces transparency and deprives the

VANCOUVER  British Columbia   When the Chinese tech executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested by the Canadian authorities in the Vancouver airport while changing flights  she suddenly became one of the world s most famous detainees Her December arrest   made at the United States  request for her extradition on fraud charges   provoked a storm of recriminations from China  landed Ms  Meng in legal limbo  and put Canada in the middle of a fight between two world powers that are both rivals and trading partners Since then  relations between China and Canada have become increasingly strained  and China has arrested two Canadians  accusing them of espionage  and sentenced a third to death on a drug charge On Wednesday  the next chapter in Ms  Meng s case opened with an extradition proceeding at the Supreme Court of British Columbia  A hearing was set for May 8 to discuss next steps in the case  Chief among them will be setting a date for an extradition hearing to decide whether she should be sent to face fraud charges in the United States Ms  Meng  dressed casually in a sweatshirt with a simple clip in her hair  appeared composed as she sat in the courtroom next to an interpreter  She joined the large group of journalists  supporters and curious members of the public assembled in the courtroom as they bowed to the judge as the proceeding began Highlighting what he called the extraordinary context of the case  Richard Peck  a member of Ms  Meng s defense team  said there were concerns about its  political character   alluding to comments by President Trump that he was willing to intercede in the proceedings As the case moves forward  here s what you need to know Who is Meng Wanzhou A polished executive  Ms  Meng  46  is the chief financial officer of the Chinese tech giant Huawei  and the eldest daughter of its founder  Ren Zhengfei Ms  Meng  who also uses the names Sabrina and Cathy  was born in the western city of Chengdu  A high school dropout  she went on to get a master s degree  began at Huawei as a secretary and eventually rose to become a public face of the company ImageMeng Wanzhou  Huawei s chief financial officer  was arrested by Canadian authorities in December CreditAlexander Bibik ReutersMs  Meng was an important figure at Huawei as it rapidly expanded  Her job included announcing its financial results and speaking at public events around the world She was arrested  on Dec  1 at the request of the United States  which asked for her extradition and accused her of fraud She has been  awaiting her extradition hearing in Vancouver  where she and her husband own two expensive homes  She was released on bail of  10 million Canadian dollars  and is relatively free to roam about the city  although under 24 hour surveillance and wearing a GPS tracker on her ankle During her bail hearing  her lawyer told the court that  during her detention  she was considering studying for a doctorate in business administration and hoped to spend time with her family Her detainment has prompted an outpouring of support in China  where many people see her as a hostage What is the case against her Huawei has become the world s largest supplier of the equipment that underlies the world s wireless networks  The United States  however  has repeatedly accused the company of stealing technology from its Western rivals and believes its close ties to the Chinese government make it a threat to national security In January  the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment that  among other things  accuses Ms  Meng of fraudulently deceiving four banks so that Huawei could evade American sanctions against Iran It also accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and obstructing a criminal investigation into what it said was the company s effort to avoid those sanctions by destroying or concealing evidence What is expected to happen at her extradition hearing in Canada Legal experts say Ms  Meng is likely to be extradited  though it could take months for the courts to reach a final decision  Wednesday s hearing is the first step Joanna Harrington  a professor of law at the University of Alberta  noted that Canada has a track record of granting about 90 percent of extradition requests ImageA sign in support of Ms  Meng outside a court in Vancouver CreditDavid Ryder ReutersAlso  Canada usually grants extradition requests from democratic allies like the United States At the hearing  the judge will examine whether the fraud that Ms  Meng is charged with in the United States is also a crime in Canada  The judge cannot refuse to extradite her on the grounds that the case will not succeed at trial Ms  Meng s defense lawyers have already said that the charges are politically motivated  which could potentially help her in the extradition case  Mr  Trump may have given credence to this argument when he said he was willing to intercede in the case if that helped achieve a trade deal with China Assuming the court does decide to extradite her  the matter would then be referred to the country s recently appointed justice minister  David Lametti  a former law professor at McGill University in Montreal who specialized in intellectual property After that  Ms  Meng could appeal through the Canadian courts How has the case affected Canada Chinese relations From the day of Ms  Meng s arrest  Canada has said it was legally bound to detain her at the request of its ally  Beijing sees it differently Shortly after her arrest  the Chinese authorities arrested two Canadians  Michael Kovrig  a former diplomat  and Michael Spavor  a businessman  Just days after Canada approved Ms  Meng s extradition hearing  the Chinese government accused them of espionage The two men have been held in secret detention sites in China with no access to lawyers or visits from their families A third Canadian  Robert Lloyd Schellenberg  was sentenced in January to death for drug smuggling All three cases have caused alarm in Canada  where many have pointed to Ms  Meng s comparatively cushy detainment Adding to the acrimony  lawyers for Ms  Meng announced over the weekend that they would sue members of the Canadian Border Services Agency  the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the federal government for breaching her constitutional rights when she was detained for three hours in December before being formally arrested Despite the tensions  the economic ties between the two countries have persevered  Canadians continue to buy Chinese products  including Huawei smartphones  and the Chinese continue to gobble up

BEIJING   China s premier said on Tuesday that his government would respond to an economic slowdown by cutting taxes  easing burdens on the private sector and giving markets a bigger role   diluting the heavily pro state pronouncements and policies that critics have warned were scaring investors Calling 2019 a  crucial year  for China s economy  Premier Li Keqiang  the second ranking official in China after President Xi Jinping  laid out measures long supported by private businesses  Mr  Li s annual report to the national legislature revived rhetoric about market solutions after the government faced growing criticism for favoring government initiatives and state owned companies  squeezing out private enterprise  We will keep using market oriented reforming thinking   Mr  Li said in his report   The government must act with resolve to hand matters it shouldn t manage over to the market  But the specifics of his speech to the legislature did not go as far as domestic or foreign critics would have liked  And this year s session of China s Communist Party controlled legislature  the National People s Congress  underscored how much economic anxieties have come to dominate policy a year after Mr  Xi appeared politically indomitable The nearly 3 000 congress delegates meet once a year to loyally approve legislation  reports and budgets  Last year  Mr  Xi  who is also the party leader  used the meeting to entrench his power  pushing through changes to the Constitution that abolished a term limit on the presidency  That meeting also approved a broad restructuring of the government and established a new anticorruption agency But the triumphant glow of Mr  Xi s victory last March has dimmed  Mr  Li echoed the somber tone of Mr  Xi s recent comments about the year ahead  which is dotted with sensitive anniversaries   above all  30 years since the armed crackdown of June 3 to 4  1989  on pro democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square in Beijing Mr  Li made little mention of the trade frictions with the Trump administration  But he stressed the risks facing China  We will face a graver and more complicated environment  as well as risks and challenges   Mr  Li said   We must be fully prepared for a tough struggle  ImageA media tour of the new Beijing Daxing International Airport  which is scheduled to be completed in June  June will also mark 30 years since the Tiananmen Square crackdown  one of the sensitive anniversaries in China in 2019 CreditKevin Frayer Getty ImagesThe Chinese economy has slowed sharply since summer  mainly because of tight restrictions imposed on lending a year ago to curb debt  The trade war with the United States has also damaged the confidence of businesses and consumers  making entrepreneurs less willing to invest in export factories and consumers less eager to buy big ticket items like apartments and new cars  This was not a leadership that appeared strong and decisive with a clear vision   said Elizabeth C  Economy  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and the author of  The Third Revolution   which studied Mr  Xi s years in power Besides slowing growth  she said  China s leaders must contend with rising household debt  the failure of looser birth restrictions to slow the aging crisis and growing shortfalls in the pension system Mr  Li laid out how the government intends to turn around some of those problems He set an ambitious target for economic growth this year of 6 to 6 5 percent  That allows for slightly slower expansion than last year s target of about 6 5 percent  Growth of China s gross domestic product for 2018 came in at 6 6 percent  Many Western economists suspect that Chinese statistics may overestimate recent growth  however The three main choices for maintaining high growth have been to further ramp up spending on roads  bridges  rail lines and other infrastructure  to print more money and force banks to lend more  or to cut taxes and deregulate The government has been slow to cut taxes or deregulate  preferring to maintain its revenues and control  But many tycoons want lower taxes  In his report  Mr  Li also said the government would reduce the burden on employers from social insurance and old age insurance for workers  Tax cuts and fee reductions get right to the spot in tackling the pains and difficulties  currently troubling businesses  he said Mr  Li also promised to cut taxes a year ago  But economists believe that much of the effect of the nominal cuts was offset by stricter collection  The more tax we have  the heavier our burden will be when we go overseas and go into battle   said Liu Hanyuan  the chairman of Tongwei Group  a conglomerate making everything from fish food to solar panels ImagePeople s Liberation Army soldiers marching at Tiananmen Square on Saturday  Mr  Li revealed that China will continue to spend heavily to modernize its military  although at a slightly lower pace than last year CreditRoman Pilipey EPA  via ShutterstockIn the past decade  Beijing turned to huge  debt fueled investments in infrastructure and big increases in the money supply each time that the economy appeared to be slowing more than the country s leaders could tolerate  The infrastructure investments have given China one of the world s finest transportation networks But many companies and local governments are now struggling to pay all the debt they have accumulated  Rapid increases in mortgages and the broader money supply have driven the prices of apartments skyward  far beyond what most young people can afford  Real estate prices have jumped more than tenfold in the past two decades in many towns and cities China s leaders set out at the start of last year to reduce debt   only to find that the economy slowed markedly by June  In July  President Trump began in earnest a trade war with China  By autumn  business and investor confidence had plummeted  investment in new factories and other equipment was stalling  and car sales were in a nose dive The government responded this winter by again ramping up infrastructure spending and debt  A broad measure of debt known as total social financing posted a record jump in January Total debt has not come down the way Chinese officials hoped a year ago  But China has made progress by cracking down hard on the barely regulated shadow banking system  while encouraging a big increase in the sale of bonds by local governments and corporations Relying more on bonds now means a less opaque system that may be a little less prone to sudden financial panics  But it has exposed another problem  Most small and medium size enterprises are not large enough or profitable enough to issue bonds  These enterprises create 90 percent of the new jobs in China  but the state controlled banking system has long been reluctant to lend to them The annual work report by China s premier  delivered in a very long speech in the Great Hall of the People  resembles in some ways the State of the Union address that the president of the United States delivers to Congress each year Mr  Li had little new to say about foreign policy or domestic political threats  But the proposed budget released at the same time as his speech revealed that China would continue to spend heavily to modernize its military  although at a slightly lower pace than last year  Military spending in 2019 would rise by 7 5 percent to about  178 billion  the budget showed  Last year  the military budget grew by 8 1 percent  The world today faces profound changes of a kind unseen in a century   Mr  Li said in his speech 
WASHINGTON   The National Security Agency has quietly shut down a system that analyzes logs of Americans  domestic calls and texts  according to a senior Republican congressional aide  halting a program that has touched off disputes about privacy and the rule of law since the Sept  11 attacks The agency has not used the system in months  and the Trump administration might not ask Congress to renew its legal authority  which is set to expire at the end of the year  according to the aide  Luke Murry  the House minority leader s national security adviser In a raw assertion of executive power  President George W  Bush s administration started the program as part of its intense pursuit for Qaeda conspirators in the weeks after the 2001 terrorist attacks  and a court later secretly blessed it  The intelligence contractor Edward J  Snowden disclosed the program s existence in 2013  jolting the public and contributing to growing awareness of how both governments and private companies harvest and exploit personal data The way that intelligence analysts have gained access to bulk records of Americans  phone calls and texts has evolved  but the purpose has been the same  They analyze social links to hunt for associates of known terrorism suspects Intelligence agencies can use the technique on data obtained through other means  like collection from networks abroad  where there are fewer legal limits  But those approaches do not offer the same systematic access to domestic phone records Congress ended and replaced the program disclosed by Mr  Snowden with the U S A  Freedom Act of 2015  which will expire in December  Security and privacy advocates have been gearing up for a legislative battle over whether to extend or revise the program   and with what changes  if any Mr  Murry  who is an adviser for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  raised doubts over the weekend about whether that debate will be necessary  His remarks came during a podcast for the national security website Lawfare Mr  Murry brought up the pending expiration of the Freedom Act  but then disclosed that the Trump administration  hasn t actually been using it for the past six months   I m actually not certain that the administration will want to start that back up   Mr  Murry said He referred to problems that the National Security Agency disclosed last year   Technical irregularities  had contaminated the agency s database with message logs it had no authority to collect  so officials purged hundreds of millions of call and text records gathered from American telecommunications firms The agency declined to comment on Monday  Press officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment Matt Sparks  a spokesman for Mr  McCarthy s office  said late Monday that Mr  Murry  was not speaking on behalf of administration policy or what Congress intends to do on this issue  Christopher Augustine  an N S A  spokesman  told The New York Times in January that agency officials were  carefully evaluating all aspects  of the Freedom Act program  and were discussing its future Mr  Augustine made clear that the White House would make the final call about whether to ask Congress to extend the Freedom Act The disclosure that the program has apparently been shut down for months  changes the entire landscape of the debate   said Daniel Schuman  the policy director of Demand Progress  an advocacy group that focuses on civil liberties and government accountability Since  the sky hasn t fallen  without the program  he said  the intelligence community must make the case that reviving it is necessary   if  indeed  the National Security Agency thinks it is worth the effort to keep trying to make it work The phone records program had never thwarted a terrorist attack  a fact that emerged during the post Snowden debate  If there is an ongoing program  even if we all have doubts about it  that s a very different political matter than if the program has actually stopped   Mr  Schuman said   Then the question becomes   Why restart it   rather than whether to turn it off  The National Security Agency has used the call detail records   metadata showing who called whom and when  but not the content of what was said   as a map of social networks  analyzing links between people to identify associates of terrorism suspects Even without the program  the agency could still collect telecommunications data from abroad  which domestic surveillance laws have left largely unregulated  But while overseas based collection can give some access to Americans  data  it apparently does not provide the systematic access to purely domestic phone messages The phone records program traces back to the aftermath of the Sept  11 attacks when the Bush administration created the secret Stellarwind surveillance program  One component involved the bulk collection of logs of Americans  domestic phone calls Companies like AT T and MCI   later part of Verizon   initially turned over their customers  records in response to an order by Mr  Bush  Starting in 2006  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court began issuing secret orders requiring the companies to participate  based on a novel interpretation of Section 215 of the Patriot Act  which said the F B I  may obtain business records  relevant  to a terrorism investigation In June 2013  the program came to light after The Guardian published the first revelation from the trove of classified files provided by Mr  Snowden  a top secret surveillance court order to Verizon to provide its customers  call records The disclosure  one of the most significant by Mr  Snowden  prompted sharp criticism of the government s theory about why it was legal  Essentially  everyone s phone records were relevant because the government needed to acquire the haystack so that it could hunt for needles of investigative interest  An appeals court later rejected that theory While intelligence officials could not point to attacks the program had thwarted  they defended the ability as a useful triaging tool for sifting through potential connections   and suggested that had it been in place before Sept  11  it might have helped uncover Al Qaeda s plot  Critics called that argument exaggerated and portrayed it as a legally dubious invasion of privacy that was ripe for abuse The Obama administration eventually embraced a plan to end the National Security Agency s bulk collection of domestic phone data but preserve the old program s analytical ability  resulting in the Freedom Act of 2015 Under that law  the bulk records remained in the hands of the phone companies  not the government  But with a judge s permission  the agency could swiftly retrieve the phone and text logs of particular suspects as well as of all of the people who had been in contact with those suspects  even when they were customers of different phone companies Under the replacement system  the number of records about Americans  communications that the agency collected dropped significantly from the billions per day it had previously been sucking in Yet the scale of collection remained huge  The program gathered 151 million records in 2016  despite obtaining court orders to use the system on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016  along with a few left over from late 2015  In 2017  it obtained orders for 40 targets and collected 534 million records Problems with the system emerged last year  when the National Security Agency said it had decided to delete its entire database of records gathered since the Freedom Act system became operational  Glenn S  Gerstell  the agency s general counsel  said in an interview at the time that because of complex technical glitches  one or more telecom providers   he declined to say which   had responded to court orders for records by sending logs to the agency that included both accurate and inaccurate data When the agency then fed those numbers back to the telecoms to get the communications logs of all of the people who had been in contact with its targets  it ended up gathering some data of people unconnected to the targets  The agency had no authority to collect their information  nor a practical way to go through its large database and cull those records it should not have gathered  As a result  it decided to purge them all and start over But it had not been clear until Mr  Murry s comments in the podcast that was posted over the weekend that the problems have continued  even as a legislative battle over the Freedom Act   and the inevitable scrutiny of how the program has functioned   has drawn near 
The House Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating allegations of voter suppression in Georgia under Secretary of State Brian Kemp  who has since become governor The investigation was revealed in letters that the committee s Democratic leaders sent on Wednesday to Mr  Kemp and his successor as secretary of state  Brad Raffensperger  The letters instructed Mr  Kemp and Mr  Raffensperger   both Republicans   to provide by March 20 a wide range of documents concerning voter roll purges  holds placed on voter registration applications  polling site changes and closings  and other voting related issues The committee also requested all documents related to the potential conflict of interest Mr  Kemp faced in administering an election in which he was a candidate  The Committee is particularly concerned by reports that Georgians faced unprecedented challenges with registering to vote and significant barriers to casting their votes during your tenure as secretary of state and during the 2018 election   Representatives Elijah E  Cummings  the committee chairman  and Jamie Raskin  head of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  wrote to Mr  Kemp Mr  Kemp and Republicans on the committee immediately dismissed the investigation as a political effort  aimed at undermining the results of an election that Democrats lost  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  The letter outlined several points of scrutiny during the 2018 governor s race  in which Stacey Abrams  a Democrat  posed a strong challenge to Mr  Kemp in a normally solidly Republican state Many voters  especially in heavily African American counties  waited at polling places for hours while  hundreds of available voting machines sat unused in government warehouses   the letter noted  State officials had sequestered those machines in response to a federal lawsuit that said they were vulnerable to hacking Tens of thousands of voter registration applications  mostly from African Americans  were held up under a state law that requires the name on the application to exactly match the name on the applicant s government ID  even a missing hyphen can cause problems Mr  Kemp s office purged more than 1 4 million voters from the rolls during his tenure   States are required to keep their rolls up to date and remove people who have moved  but some  including Georgia  have been much more zealous than others  starting the purging process on the basis of a voter not having cast a ballot recently   And county and state officials closed more than 200 polling places from 2012 to 2018 Throughout the campaign  Mr  Kemp denied intentional voter suppression  Asked for comment on Wednesday  his spokesman directed The Times to video of a news conference where Mr  Kemp suggested that the investigation was a politically motivated distraction from more important issues  They need to quit playing politics up there   Mr  Kemp said at the news conference  before pivoting to an attack on House Democrats for giving billions of dollars in disaster aid to Puerto Rico  when we have our own farmers that are fixing to lose their farm   He said nothing about the substance of the allegations or the document requests  and his spokesman did not respond to a follow up email Mr  Raffensperger  the current secretary of state  said that he had received his own letter and that his office  looks forward to an open dialogue and a thorough process  Mr  Cummings and Mr  Raskin  the Democratic committee leaders  were not immediately available for interviews on Wednesday  But their decision to open the investigation was more evidence that House Democrats  newly empowered by the November election  intend to act aggressively on issues like allegations of voter suppression that were on the back burner for the first two years of the Trump administration Representative Jim Jordan  the committee s ranking Republican  said through a spokesman that it was  highly unusual for a congressional committee to involve itself in a state s election   This is squarely in the purview of the state of Georgia  not the House Oversight Committee   Mr  Jordan said in a statement   We can t help but think that attempts by the Democrats to insert the committee into the state s business is an attempt to relitigate an election result that they do not like  Mr  Kemp narrowly defeated Ms  Abrams  who ended her campaign by declaring   This is not a speech of concession  because concession means to acknowledge an action is right  true or proper

tragic story line that has played out across the country  An unarmed young black man is killed by police officers who said they believed he had a gun and believed their lives were in danger Here s what you need to know about the case What s next  The legal fights are far from over  In January  Mr  Clark s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city and the two officers And the federal authorities announced later on Tuesday that they would investigate whether Mr  Clark s civil rights had been violated Also  after protests on Monday night ended in 84 arrests of demonstrators and the detainment of a longtime Sacramento Bee reporter  Mayor Darrell Steinberg directed the city s public safety accountability office to investigate what happened  Protesters said they d been effectively tricked and trapped by police officers when they said they were trying to get to cars to leave Protests were expected to continue Tuesday night What does this mean for the attorney general  Mr  Becerra has a powerful  high profile elected office in a progressive state   an office that has historically been a springboard for leaders with even bigger political ambitions  like former Gov  Jerry Brown and Senator Kamala Harris But while Mr  Becerra has become well known for leading the state s fights against President Trump s agenda  suing the administration now 47 times  he s been less aggressive about policing the police  as CALmatters put it Recently  he s taken heat for not ruling out legal action against journalists who got a list of police officers who had been convicted of crimes through a public records request This all comes amid growing discussion about what truly progressive criminal justice policies look like  The question of whether Mr  Becerra s predecessor  Ms  Harris  can effectively pitch herself as a  progressive prosecutor  has been up for intense debate as she runs for president  If you missed it  here s The Times s comprehensive analysis of police

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  The day s top stories   Attorney General Xavier Becerra added one more lawsuit yesterday to the several dozen he s filed against the Trump administration  This one aims to block moves that would effectively strip millions of dollars in federal funding from reproductive health care providers that perform abortions

around the state  scientists are working to solve the universe s toughest puzzles  or hurtling toward world changing discoveries Recently  I talked to a team of researchers at U C  Irvine and U C  Riverside who managed to make a finding that could be world changing   and it s kind of terrifying It s possible to record the subtle sounds of a DNA synthesis machine working in a lab and then reverse engineer whatever genetic materials the machine is making In other words  it s possible to hack such a machine by  in effect  listening to it The idea for the project  said Mohammad Al Faruque  an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at U C I   stemmed from his previous work stealing blueprints for things printed by a 3 D printer  If you can eavesdrop on a machine  you can understand what it s making   he said   And with the 3 D printer  we demonstrated that  But if what you re stealing is a genetic blueprint  the stakes are much higher  It could be health information or pharmaceuticals   or the recipe for a biological weapon Philip Brisk  a U C  Riverside associate professor of computer science and engineering  said that because Microsoft was working on DNA data storage  the finding could have implications for information security And William Grover  a U C  Riverside assistant professor of bioengineering  said that while not everybody has a 3 D printer or a DNA synthesizer  lots of people have Alexas or Google Homes  Everybody makes noises in their day to day business  which can be vulnerable to side channel attacks   he said  And medical machines like the ones in health care offices also make noise Still  before you get the urge to wrap your house in tinfoil  team members said the research was encouraging First  Mr  Al Faruque said  as engineering as a discipline undergoes  a paradigm shift   research is the result of a new kind of collaboration that will be necessary to solve increasingly multifaceted problems  The team  for example  needed bioengineering experts as well as computer engineers  We had the right grouping of players   he said Second  doing research that highlights vulnerabilities makes it possible to design products with solutions in mind Mr  Brisk said that right now  cost is often the top priority in designing labs and products  But this kind of research  he said  forces designers and engineers to pay attention to security  too  You could optimize so that there s less information bouncing around   he said   I m sure the right type of engineering expertise exists somewhere  Here s what else

WASHINGTON   Scott Gottlieb  the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration  known for his aggressive efforts to regulate the tobacco and e cigarette industries  said on Tuesday that he would resign at the end of the month The reason he gave was family and his weariness with commuting to see his wife and three children  who have remained in their Westport  Conn  home since he took office  But his announcement caught many in Washington and the industries he regulates by surprise and raised questions about whether his push to reduce teenage vaping and lower nicotine levels and ban menthol in cigarettes will continue in an administration that generally has a hands off approach to business  It s critical that his successor champions protecting kids and the rest of the nation against the tobacco epidemic   said Cliff Douglas  vice president of tobacco control at the American Cancer Society   Gottlieb has taken historic steps to take on this epidemic in a new way  including such proposals as reducing nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels and now pursuing a potential ban on menthol in cigarettes  so it is critical that whoever succeeds him picks up that mantel and treats it with equal priority that he has given it  Dr  Gottlieb has been subject to increasing pressure from some Republicans in Congress and his former associates in the conservative movement for his tough stance against youth vaping and traditional cigarettes  A coalition of influential conservative groups recently asked the White House to block some key parts of the F D A  s strategy to prevent youths from vaping  Republican Senator Richard Burr blasted the commissioner on the Senate floor for his proposal to ban menthol cigarettes Dr  Gottlieb said these protests had no role in his departure  There s no intrigue here   he said in an interview  A senior White House official said Dr  Gottlieb was not pressured to leave and that the President was  very fond  of him Dr  Gottlieb said he planned to advance the F D A  s pending tobacco regulations before he leaves  And he was confident  he said  that the agency s guidance on restricting flavored e cigarettes would be issued before he left  He acknowledged  however  that he could not predict the fate of his proposals to ban menthol in cigarettes and reduce nicotine to nonaddictive levels in cigarettes Industry analysts expressed optimism that those initiatives would  in fact  now end  We think this major development will be broadly viewed as a positive for the tobacco industry  although this introduces some uncertainty   Bonnie Herzog  a managing director of equity research at Wells Fargo Securities  wrote in an email to clients   We believe his resignation calls into question whether or not the FDA will in fact enforce harsher regulations around youth e cig usage access  cig nicotine limits and a cig menthol ban given he was the champion behind these initiatives  When he was first nominated  Dr  Gottlieb seemed a figure right out of central casting for the Trump administration  As a venture capitalist who served as both a consultant and board member for drug companies  he had made a fortune from the industry he would regulate  written impassioned anti regulatory columns in conservative journals  and held stock in industry players large and small  which he divested  But he was also a physician  and as he settled into the job  his libertarian views were often balanced by his zeal to protect public health  He was remarkably successful at keeping the agency moving forward at a difficult time and really focused on public health challenges  including the opioid epidemic and drug prices    said Dr  Joshua M  Sharfstein  a former principal deputy commissioner at the F D A  during the Obama administration  who is now a professor of health policy at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health   He surprised a lot of people in his willingness to take some risks for public health  Under Dr  Gottlieb s leadership  the F D A  approved a record number of generic medicines  new drugs  and medical devices  He led the agency into unusual territory  calling for lower drug prices and speaking out about the opioid crisis But his record on opioids was mixed  some policy experts said  Although the agency worked to take one powerful addictive painkiller  Opana ER  off the market  it approved Dsuvia  a new form of an extremely potent opioid  for acute pain   which public health advocates feared would be just as dangerous Ryan Hampton  who advocates for people recovering from addictions and who has testified before Congress  recently helped launch a campaign   Wake Up F D A    to protest the agency s approval of Dsuvia  while being slow to approve new medications to treat addiction  though Dr  Gottlieb spoke often about the importance of doing so  The ideal response would be not to bring more dangerous opioids to the market in the midst of a public health crisis   Mr  Hampton said of the F D A  under Dr  Gottlieb   That was a huge red flag and lapse in judgment on Gottlieb s part  Once that happened  folks in the recovery community lost confidence in Gottlieb and the F D A  Likewise  the F D A  s speedy approval of many medical devices was praised by the growing industry  but has drawn strong protests from many people who believe the rate of approval has been too rapid to ensure safety  He also worked to better track outbreaks of food borne illness  and to boost new treatments like gene therapy and targeted medicine During his tenure at the F D A   Dr  Gottlieb  who was not shy about announcing his achievements  sometimes several times a day on social media  eventually moved from a hands off approach to the nascent e cigarette companies  to leading a clamorous fight against them  particularly as studies emerged about how teenagers swarmed the new product  unaware of the addictive properties of nicotine In shifting his position  from giving the companies years to show that e cigarettes were both safe and effective for smoking cessation  to urging stringent monitoring of convenience stores  vaping flavors and age restrictions  Dr  Gottlieb earned both the umbrage of pro business leaders and some aspersions from the antismoking movement  which felt he moved too slowly Matthew L  Myers  president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids  acknowledged that Dr  Gottlieb walked a tightrope  leaving a complex record in his wake   He has made proposals that had the potential to reduce tobacco use more dramatically than any other federal public official in U S  history   Mr  Myers said   On e cigarettes he deserves enormous credit for shining a spotlight on the crisis of its use by kids   But   Mr  Myers continued   the fact that he has not prohibited the marketing of the flavored products outright has contributed to the problem  His legacy will depend upon whether his proposals  including those for e cigarettes  ultimately become law  And the landmark tobacco regulation plan  announced in July 2017  has lagged in some important areas  After the tobacco industry sent thousands of letters against reducing nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels  that plan has stalled  The proposal to eliminate menthol in cigarettes has not yet been formalized  Dr  Gottlieb s early decision to give e cigarette companies more time to comply with new  tougher regulations is viewed by many as having opened the door to the youth vaping epidemic 
Three years ago this month  as alarms about the over prescription of opioid painkillers were sounding across the country  the federal government issued course correcting guidelines for primary care doctors  Prescriptions have fallen notably since then  and the Trump administration is pushing for them to drop by another third by 2021 But in a letter to be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday  more than 300 medical experts  including three former White House drug czars  contend that the guidelines are harming one group of vulnerable patients  those with severe chronic pain  who may have been taking high doses of opioids for years without becoming addicted  They say the guidelines are being used as cover by insurers to deny reimbursement and by doctors to turn patients away  As a result  they say  patients who could benefit from the medications are being thrown into withdrawal and suffering renewed pain and a diminished quality of life  even to the point of suicide The letter writers form an uneasy alliance spanning differing positions on opioids   professors of addiction medicine as well as pain specialists  some patient representatives who have taken money from the pharmaceutical industry  and the former drug czars  from the Obama  Clinton and Nixon administrations Michael Botticelli  who served as the drug czar under President Obama and now leads the Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center  said he signed the letter because  there has been enough anecdotal evidence to raise the alarm bells  about the misuse of the guidelines leading to pain patients losing effective treatment  The C D C  really does need a rigorous evaluation of this because we don t know how big the problem is   he said   Minimally  we need some level of clarification on appropriate use of the guidelines  Specifically  the letter asks the C D C  to emphatically state that treatment decisions for these patients be left to their doctors  It is imperative that health care professionals and administrators realize that the guideline does not endorse mandated involuntary dose reduction or discontinuation   the group wrote in the letter  which it also sent to members of relevant congressional committees  A spokeswoman for the C D C   Julie Eschelbach  said the guidelines  do not endorse mandated or abrupt dose reduction or discontinuation   She added that the agency has several studies underway to examine the guidelines  impact  and has published a  pocket guide  for doctors on tapering The guidelines are nonbinding  but many of them have become enshrined in state regulations  Therefore  said Dr  Stefan G  Kertesz  an author of the letter who teaches addiction medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham   it s normal to say from the top   This needs a clarification because we don t want people hurt   Others say the problem lies not with the guidelines  which urge non opioid therapies as the first line treatment for chronic pain  but with their misapplication  What the guidelines are being blamed for versus what they actually recommend are two different things   said Dr  Thomas R  Frieden  who ran the C D C  when the guidelines were developed Experts in addiction medicine distinguish patients who need opioids for chronic pain from people addicted to the drugs  while some patients are physically dependent and will go into withdrawal if the drugs are withheld  the opioids help them function  despite severe pain  But just because you re on a higher dose doesn t mean you re addicted   said Dr  Daniel P  Alford  a professor who directs addiction medicine education at the Boston University School of Medicine  who signed the letter Addiction  he said  is  a behavioral maladaptation where the medication takes over their lives  and they continue to use despite negative consequences  The guidelines say doctors should discuss the costs of a high dose regimen with pain patients and press for a prudent taper  They do not say those patients  drugs should be summarily reduced  They advise doctors to prescribe opioids to new patients only for a short time  and with a daily dose below 90 morphine milligram equivalents  That recommendation has prompted many states and monitoring systems to impose a hard stop at that level for all patients except those with cancer or in end of life care  Who says that 90 is a magical threshold   Dr  Alford asked   There s no good evidence  Yes  we should avoid escalating doses  but how do we treat people who are already on high doses  Dr  Frieden defended 90 M M E   as the measurement is known  as a responsible ceiling   The death rates just go up exponentially   he said  for people on very high doses of opioids Dr  Frieden said more doctors should be allowed to get federal permission to prescribe buprenorphine  a lower risk opioid drug that can effectively manage opioid dependence while treating pain  as an alternative to more dangerous painkillers  Dr  Frieden was charged last summer with groping a woman  he pleaded not guilty and the case is still pending  The letter to the C D C  echoes a November resolution by the American Medical Association  which protested the  misapplication  of the guidelines  by pharmacists  health insurers  pharmacy benefit managers  legislatures  and governmental and private regulatory bodies in ways that prevent or limit access to opioid analgesia  A central question is how many patients have suffered from their doses being reduced or from being taken off opioids entirely   A report by the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that in 2016 about 500 000 beneficiaries of Medicare drug plans had been getting prescriptions of 120 M M E  or greater for three months or longer   a figure that doesn t fully capture the current affected population Accompanying the experts  letter are testimonials by hundreds of pain patients detailing struggles in the wake of the guidelines The opioid prescribing rate has been falling since 2012  but the amount prescribed per person is still about three times higher than it was in 1999  at the beginning of the addiction crisis  according to the C D C  While overdose deaths because of prescription opioids have begun leveling off  deaths from illicit fentanyl and its analogues increased by more than 45 percent in 2017 alone  a phenomenon that the letter writers attribute in part to the crackdown on pain pill prescriptions  Dr  John Brooklyn  who runs two large addiction treatment programs in Vermont  gave one example  A 61 year old patient  disabled by a back injury  had been functioning well for years on 225 M M E   he said  Invoking the guidelines  his pain doctor started cutting his dose by 40 milligrams a month  When he was at 120 M M E    said Dr  Brooklyn   he was in such severe pain that he was buying opioids on the street  He barely ate  lost 40 pounds  couldn t pay rent and then turned to cheap heroin  His doctor continued to reduce his dose and  at 30 M M E   the patient called our program  Dr  Brooklyn put the patient on methadone  a type of opioid approved to treat addiction as well as to manage chronic pain   It was like watering a dehydrated plant   he said Dr  Joanna L  Starrels  an associate professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and one of the experts who helped draft the C D C  guidelines  said chronic pain patients are an especially fragile group   Some with severe persistent pain are barely getting by   she said   They are sometimes homebound  unable to work or fully participate in most of the rewarding aspects of life   Their rates of depression are high  she said  and they have few reliable treatment alternatives Research that looks at the effect of dose reduction on such patients is in its infancy  she said  In fact the guidelines include a plea for research to evaluate their efficacy That the guidelines have had widespread impact is not in question  While a handful of hospital systems and states had adopted opioid prescription limits before 2016  the number of institutions have since shot up In its annual survey of hospital based pharmacies last year  the American Society of Health System Pharmacists asked about opioid monitoring for the first time  In preliminary results  41 percent said they had done so and some cited the C D C  guidelines By the end of 2016  seven states had passed legislation limiting opioid prescriptions  by October 2018  33 states had enacted laws with some type of limit  guidance or requirement related to opioids  according to the National Conference of State Legislatures Aetna  one of the country s largest health insurers  placed a limit of 90 M M E s per day on its members last year based on the C D C  guidelines  said Ethan Slavin  a company spokesman  The stricter daily limits  are part of our efforts to help reduce the potential for misuse and diversion of the drugs   he said  adding that prescribers who believe higher doses are needed can seek special permission by consulting with Aetna s experts A study last year found that insurers overall were not doing enough to increase access to alternative pain treatments  including therapeutic massage  acupuncture and non opioid drugs Dr  Anna Lembke  medical director of addiction medicine at Stanford  declined to sign the letter  saying the guidelines were sufficiently moderate The remedy to the problems detailed in the letter  she said  was to educate primary care doctors about how to provide  safe  compassionate  patient centered tapers when medically indicated   which can be a protracted  delicate process Dr  Kertesz acknowledged that tapering was a worthy goal   But more typically what we are seeing   he said   are people who report non consensual tapers  RelatedOpinion   Maia SzalavitzWhen the Cure Is Worse Than the DiseaseFeb  9  2019
Even after more than six months  Kirad wasn t used to sharing a bed with her mother  She was now 17  and ever since they arrived in New York after fleeing Honduras  they were stuck in the same room They were staying in a tiny bungalow in Far Rockaway  Queens  that belonged to Kirad s aunt  The only common space was a kitchen just big enough to squeeze in a love seat and a small table  Every surface was covered with pots and pans  cereal boxes and bags of food  We fight sometimes over the TV   Kirad said   because my mom wants to watch something and I want to watch something different so I go to my aunt s room  For the most part  they have made it work As cramped as it is in this tiny room  Kirad had hoped to have one more family member sharing this space  her older sister  Susan  She and her mother last saw Susan in July  when they crossed the Mexican border into Eagle Pass  Tex  The family of three was seeking asylum Kirad and her mother  Ana Batiz  were allowed to pursue their case in immigration court  and went on to New York  But Susan was not  She was sent back to Honduras by herself  I m sure my mother would sleep on the couch or on the floor or whatever for the three of us to be together   Kirad said  I have never been away from them   Ms  Batiz said of her daughters  This is a story about the brutal math that asylum seekers face at the border today  In this case  a mother and a daughter with virtually identical circumstances try to immigrate to the United States  Each has an interview with an asylum officer that could alter their lives forever  Read about a family s experiences in the hours before the father of five children is deported   One persuades her interviewer that returning to Honduras was too dangerous  she enters the country to pursue an asylum claim The other  an 18 year old  fails that same test  As a result  she is separated from her only family and sent back  alone  to an environment where she feels threatened every day ImageAna Batiz in New York  where she has lived since last summer as she makes her case for asylum When Ana Batiz and her daughters arrived at the border  she did not even realize they had crossed illegally  She said she did not know there was an official point of entry at Eagle Pass  she said  so they waded across the dangerous waters of the Rio Grande with other migrants Ms  Batiz left her small village on the Atlantic coast of Honduras with plans to seek asylum  because she was persecuted for having H I V   I don t think it s right   she said   for someone to tell you   You should die   The family did not join a caravan  She said they hitched rides with other Hondurans heading north  It all fell apart when they got to the Texas border  Ms  Batiz and her two daughters were taken to what immigrants call a hielera  Spanish for  icebox   a processing center run by Customs and Border Protection That night of their arrival at Eagle Pass  according to Kirad  border agents took Susan  along with about 10 others  all young men  out of the room   They told my mother that they were going to take me out and bring me right back   Susan recalled But she didn t return Long before the Trump administration s recent policy of separating migrant children from their parents  Customs and Border Protection agents have been taking children ages 18 and over away from their parents  This is because the agency considers them to be legal adults  who should be sent to adult detention centers instead of staying with families  With the current surge in families crossing the border  this means even more 18 year olds could find themselves separated from their parents  But there s a paradox here  Although Susan was considered an adult at the border  she would have been considered a child in the United States as an immigrant seeking asylum That s because older teens like Susan fall into conflicting categories under U S  immigration policies  The Immigration and Nationality Act defines anyone under 21 and unmarried as a child  U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services also uses this definition and allows children under 21 to accompany their parents to asylum interviews  These interviews are crucial because they determine whether a migrant can stay in the country and pursue their case in immigration court As an adult at the border  Susan had been separated from her family  so she couldn t attend her mother s asylum interview  She would have to fend for herself H I V  PersecutionImageMs  Batiz getting passport photos required for their immigration case Until 2010  people with H I V  were actually banned from entering the United States  When that changed  people with H I V  could also seek asylum in the U S  if they were persecuted for it in their home country  Ms  Batiz and her daughters made a strong case that they were  She has asked that we not use the last names of her daughters out of fear for their safety In their small Honduran town  Ms  Batiz s family was part of the Garifuna community  descendants of enslaved Africans and indigenous Central Americans  The Garifuna tend to be extremely poor  and they have the highest rate of H I V  transmissions in Honduras Ms  Batiz said she learned she was infected only after Kirad was born  She felt ill and went to a doctor  who told her the news  She was H I V  positive and had been for years  Her boyfriend  who most likely infected her  left   He abandoned us   she said  He s the father of her three youngest daughters  she has two older children from a previous relationship   She had the girls tested  Susan  the middle child  was H I V  positive too Ms  Batiz turned to a nongovernmental organization in Honduras that helps people with H I V  She became an H I V  educator  Soon  Ms  Batiz was working for the organization  attending protests to demand more medicine  One time  she said  police used tear gas and hoses on demonstrators  She was also featured in a 2013 video by the Pulitzer Center about what it s like to be Garifuna and living with H I V Her descriptions are reminiscent of AIDS activists in the U S  during the 1980s who were part of the protest movement Act Up  Ms  Batiz said this activity made her an easy target in Honduras  She was a black woman with H I V   protesting for better conditions  and living in a place where people are terrified of AIDS   Sometimes I was walking down the street and some people would see me and say   Here comes the one with SIDA    she said  using the Spanish word for AIDS   It s very difficult situation to be there as an activist  Officially  Honduras has stronger protections for people with H I V  than some of its neighbors  But the reality  according to Amnesty International and the U S  State Department  is that people with H I V  are routinely denied access to jobs  education and health services  The women who are infected are considered to be dirty   said Deborah Ottenheimer  a Manhattan based gynecologist who does exams for women seeking asylum because of human rights abuses  She has met Honduran women with H I V  who experienced all types of persecution  including forced sterilization  They can t get jobs  they often are attacked  Their children   especially if their children are thought to be  not even known to be  but thought to be H I V  positive   will also be discriminated against  They won t be allowed to go to school  Ms  Batiz s daughters suffered at school  especially Susan   Everybody  all my classmates  knew about my mother and my sister  too   Kirad recalled  She said they called Susan  sidosa   a slur against people with AIDS There were also vicious attacks   They would take her to the bathroom and would put her head in the toilet   Kirad said  adding that these were filthy toilets without modern plumbing Kirad said she saw students push her sister s head into a toilet on about five different occasions  and that she would try to fight the other kids in the bathroom  Susan didn t want to tell their mother  but Kirad did  When Ms  Batiz confronted the school  she said the director behaved as though it was no big deal  At some point around 2016  things got so bad that she took both of her girls out of school and kept them at home The next year  Ms  Batiz said her house was burned down under mysterious circumstances  No one was home at the time  She didn t know who did it  and she didn t contact the police because she was certain they wouldn t investigate  But she said she knew it was arson because she smelled the gasoline   I think they were trying to get me to leave   she said The family moved in with neighboring friends  but Ms  Batiz started making plans to take Kirad and Susan to stay with her sister in New York The Credible Fear InterviewImageThe yard outside of Ms  Batiz s home in Honduras  abandoned after their house was set on fire When asylum officers conduct a credible fear interview  they ask basic questions about how a migrant was persecuted and what role the authorities played  The Trump Administration claims the bar is too low because most easily pass  even though less than a quarter actually wind up getting asylum  Migrants who pass the test can wait years for their asylum cases to go to immigration court  because of an enormous backlog  In the meantime they can qualify for working papers  The president has criticized this as  catch and release  Ms  Batiz said her interview happened the same day she arrived at the  icebox   She recalled the two officers who questioned her gasping when she told them how she faced discrimination for having H I V   I think that s why they took me out quickly   she said The next morning  Ms  Batiz and Kirad were released to go on to New York  They didn t know what happened to Susan  only that she had been taken away hours earlier  Kirad said they asked people at the processing center but were told only that Susan was taken to a different place   My mother started crying   she recalled  With no additional information  they took a bus to San Antonio where they got assistance from a Catholic aid organization  which paid for them to fly to New York Soon after arriving at her sister s home in Far Rockaway  Ms  Batiz got a call from Susan  She was 1 900 miles away at an adult detention center in Pearsall  Tex   run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement  She was examined by a doctor and given H I V  medications  But it took three weeks for her to get her credible fear interview During that waiting period  Susan said a doctor told her that the H I V  drugs she was given in Honduras were not working well  She said she was also under great distress  begging other detainees in her room to let her sleep on the bottom bunk because she was afraid of heights  She had never been away from her mother before and said she was scared of the women who worked at the detention center  claiming they said cruel things to her because she was black and from Honduras The credible fear interview took place on Aug  8  with an asylum officer speaking English in person and a Spanish interpreter on the phone  When we spoke in January  Susan recalled telling the officer about the persecution she suffered at school  She said she described how classmates would abuse her in the bathrooms   They would put my head in the toilet and urinate on me  The transcript of Susan s credible fear interview does not include this graphic incident  Regardless  it shows that Susan clearly stated that she was threatened and discriminated against  and that students wanted to kill her   Because I am H I V  positive   she said   and because I am black   She said students feared she would  contaminate  them ImageMs  Batiz and her younger daughter  right  at an immigration appointment in Manhattan Susan also described an episode in which her classmates beat her legs with a stick so badly that she was taken to a hospital  There  she said  the nurses gave her  dirty looks  because they  discriminate against black girls  Police officers spoke with Susan at the hospital  She said she told them about the attack  and that they helped her by talking to the school  When asked by the asylum officer how the police treated black people and those with H I V   Susan answered   They treat them well  The asylum officer found Susan s overall account credible  But she made a distinction that prevented Susan from moving forward with her asylum case  She checked a box that said  credible fear of persecution NOT established   She left unchecked all of the boxes designating asylum eligibility because of persecution  These are race  religion  political activity  nationality and membership in a particular social group  This last category could include people with H I V A couple of immigration and asylum experts who viewed the transcript said Susan was rightfully rejected because she said the police were helpful  Stan Weber  an immigration lawyer in Brooklyn who previously worked for ICE  said he could see that argument  in part Mr  Weber explained that the persecution Susan described was not from  a government actor or an agent of the government   He added   The parties that were inflicting the persecution or the threat of persecution were private actors  In other words  Susan was being bullied by her classmates  Nonetheless  Mr  Weber is among several experts who believe the asylum officer was unfair to Susan  noting her youth  the possibility of a language barrier and her emotional state Early in the transcript it notes  applicant is crying   Shortly after  there s another red flag  Interpreter notes that the applicant doesn t seem to connect terms in Spanish   the transcript read  adding that the interpreter and applicant  might not be able to understand each other clearly  ImageBack in Honduras  Susan almost never ventures outside except to use an outhouse or to travel to a clinic to get her H I V  medication Susan speaks both Spanish and Garifuna  She was asked if she preferred a Garifuna interpreter but she responded that she was fine continuing in Spanish  Mr  Weber said that should have given the asylum officer pause  You have an 18 year old child separated from her parent that doesn t speak a primary language that you re conversing in  that the interpreter s indicated that there s problems understanding  and she s crying and she has a very stigmatized condition  H I V  positive   he said   The officer  I think  blew it  He said the asylum officer also missed an obvious opportunity to ask about Susan s mother  because Susan stated that they came together and that her mother had gone on to New York Susan now claims the asylum officer pressured her to say the police were helpful  Within the transcript  she also said she was threatened at school by students about 20 times and never reported these incidents to the police  out of fear  because they told me they would hurt me more if I reported it  Later in August  Susan asked an immigration judge to review the asylum officer s decision  But she had no lawyer  and the hearing was conducted by video  The judge denied her appeal  Susan s family then scraped up the money to hire Elizabeth Caballero  a lawyer in Texas  who asked U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services for a new credible fear interview  Despite additional written testimony from Susan s mother and sister about her persecution  she was deported  Susan was put on a plane back to Honduras in November without any advance notice  Ms  Caballero said  giving her no chance to legally intervene  In her 12 years practicing immigration law  she said  only one other client was deported without any warning  She s still angry about it  Here we have somebody that can actually be considered part of a particular social group   Ms  Caballero said   And she got denied  A spokeswoman with the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services said it can t comment on individual cases  But she noted the 2010 law that allowed people with H I V  to enter the country  She also said the agency reviews each case on its own merit  with decisions based on relevant laws and evidence  They didn t want her here   Ms  Caballero concluded  adding she suspects it s because Susan has H I V   They re just as ignorant as the people who discriminate against her over there  in her home country  Adults or Children ImageA bodega in Far Rockaway  Queens  the neighborhood where Ms  Batiz s sister lives  and where she and her daughter are staying while petitioning for asylum In Queens  Ms  Batiz describes feeling at ease without the discrimination she suffered in Honduras  But she constantly worries about Susan  In January  Ms  Batiz met with her lawyer  Cristina Velez  at the Jamaica office of Queens Legal Services  They sat at a small table in a sparsely furnished conference room and made a video call to Susan in Honduras  so Ms  Velez could learn more about what happened to prepare for Ms  Batiz s asylum claim Susan s oval face filled the screen of her mother s cellphone  Now 19  she is staying with the same friends who put her family up after the 2017 fire  The two room house is crowded  with a bedroom where seven people are sleeping  It s crammed with belongings  and the windows are covered by wooden shutters and fabric Susan pointed the phone to show her mother and lawyer the bright blue Caribbean sky and the bed where she sleeps  A paralegal who is fluent in Spanish was translating for Ms  Velez and everyone wanted to know one thing  Is she safe  I do not feel safe   Susan said through the interpreter  her voice growing animated  When Ms  Velez asked why  she described people coming to the house and threatening her  They wear ski masks on their head and they told me that they re going to kill me if they see me alone  and why did I come back here  I should have stayed with my mother where I was  Susan said it has happened about six times since she returned in November  and that they sometimes pointed guns at her   They want to kill me because I have H I V    she said  She locks herself in the house when they come  She said she doesn t know who they are  but speculated that the men could be members of the local gangs  so common in Honduras  who have threatened her family and others in the past for refusing to cooperate with them  Susan said she only goes out with a friend occasionally  or to take a taxi to the hospital once a month for her H I V  medicine ImageSusan says that armed men in masks have come to the house where she is staying and threatened her After listening to this account  Ms  Velez said that Ms  Batiz has a very strong case for asylum and that Susan would have  as well  She can t understand the logic in separating the mother and daughter  I haven t seen a case in which a family member who is really still dependent on the parent and whose cases overlap so entirely be separated from the family unit and not permitted to make her case   she said Kirad is now starting over as a freshman at a public high school in Queens with a bilingual program  She has a backpack filled with notebooks for math  history  biology and English  She thinks Susan would love the high school  and wishes they could go together But the odds are against Susan ever joining her sister  Because she failed to persuade an asylum officer of her credible fear  and her appeal to a judge was then denied  Susan can t try seeking asylum again  Even if she were somehow able to make the trek by herself from Honduras to the border  she would face a different process for being allowed to stay in the country because of her prior removal  The bar for passing this test would be much higher  making that  a risky proposition  according to Ms  Velez  her mother s lawyer Now Susan s only hope of coming to the U S  lies with her mother s case  If Ms  Batiz is granted asylum  she could bring her daughter here as a dependent  Her next court date is in May  but it s just a procedural hearing  The immigration court in New York is so backlogged it could take another year or more for her trial Speaking from Honduras  Susan said she s not giving up hope  She hasn t been able to go to school for about three years  But if she makes it to the U S   she said  she wants to go to a technical school and become a nurse   I want to keep studying and doing something with my life   she said José Olivares of WNYC contributed translation assistance and research  and Lidia Hernandez contributed translation assistance Beth Fertig   bethfertig  is a reporter

Why don t streaming services like Hulu or Netflix go bankrupt  After all  most businesses couldn t survive if customers paid a flat subscription fee each month for all they could eat or all the gasoline they could use  Yet you can pay Netflix  8 99 and watch one movie or all 342 episodes  so far  of  Grey s Anatomy   Netflix doesn t care Netflix and Hulu can do this because they sell products with a very low marginal cost  Movies and TV shows are expensive to make  But once that s done  each new stream costs Netflix little or nothing Another product works in a similar way  medicine Last week the Senate grilled pharmaceutical officials about the absurd costs of medicines  Public outrage had been building  but it exploded in 2013 with the debut of new cures for hepatitis C  They were very good drugs with very high prices   the first two listed for  84 000 and  94 500 per 12 week treatment  Now  popular revolt is brewing over the costs of insulin  naloxone  penicillin  EpiPens and many other drugs The executives commiserated with the American people   and blamed everyone else in the supply chain  Although President Trump has promised tough action  the administration has taken the issue only semi seriously  talking about measures that have brought down prices in other countries   a little But Australia is doing something that could help a lot  treating medicines like Netflix treats shows In 2015  Australia signed agreements with Gilead  AbbVie  Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck  producers of the new hep C cures  For 1 billion Australian dollars    766 million U S    Australia gets  for five years  all the hep C medicine it can use The size and certainty of the payment guarantees that the drug companies will get large profits  And they can look like good guys A study just published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that on average  Australia pays  7 352  U S   per course of treatment  It has been able to treat seven times as many patients as it would without the agreements In the United States  Louisiana and Washington State are following Australia  In bidding that closed on Thursday  Louisiana received responses from AbbVie  Merck and a Gilead subsidiary  Asegua Therapeutics  Louisiana s secretary of health  Dr  Rebekah Gee  said that the state hopes to have contracts with one or more companies and begin getting medicines on July 1 This is a big deal  The model can be used in other places and for other drugs  Most important  it s something drugmakers are willing to do   It s feasible to implement other ways of paying for innovation   said Dr  Suerie Moon  the lead author of the study  who is director of research at the Global Health Center of the Graduate Institute of Geneva   That s what s been missing so far in some of the state level debates  It s been done  at a large scale  It s not a crazy experiment  Hep C kills more people in the United States than all other infectious diseases combined  Cases are soaring  largely caused by injection of heroin and opiates  it s a blood borne virus spread by sharing needles Yet six years after the debut of the first new cure  only 450 000 people have been treated   15 percent of those with hep C in America The reason is cost  For a clue about what hep C drugs actually cost to make  consider Greg Jefferys  an Australian who runs a hep C buyers  club  Sophie Cousins profiled him in Fixes last year   Mr  Jefferys arranges shipping of Harvon  the drug listed at  94 500   which is made in India by generic drugmakers licensed by Gilead  such as Cipla and Mylan  The cost is  850 for a full course of treatment  and that includes shipping anywhere  Mr  Jefferys offers other hep C drugs as well  He recently started selling to low income patients  for  350 per course of treatment  a drug combination that has been effective against all strains of hep C   American authorities have permitted Mr  Jefferys s patients to import these medicines  It s true that nobody actually pays  94 500  The system of rebates and discounts is so complex that it s impossible to track what governments and insurers actually pay  but it s probably closer to  50 000 per treatment Nevertheless  between 2013 and 2015  Medicaid spending on outpatient drugs rose by 41 5 percent   almost entirely attributable to new hep C medicines  Kentucky spent 7 percent of its Medicaid budget in 2014 to treat only 861 hep C patients  The cost has forced most states to reserve the drug for the sickest patients  And most states require patients to be off drugs in order to get treatment That is a dumb public health move  Hep C is a contagious disease  Just as with H I V   limiting treatment only spreads the virus  And the people most likely to pass it on are injecting drug users   who are barred from getting treatment Nor does it make financial sense  Failure to treat hep C not only spread the epidemic  it also leads to chronic liver disease  cirrhosis and liver cancer The real cost effective  and humane  strategy would be to aim to eradicate hep C  A study by the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales  which studies infectious diseases  found that Australia is now on track to do that there by 2026 Louisiana is the sickest state in the nation  according to Dr  Gee  and one of the poorest  In January  the state asked drug makers to bid on a plan to supply unlimited amounts of hep C drugs for a payment of  35 million   the amount it had spent in 2018 to treat only about 1 000 of the estimated 90 000 people infected The money would treat patients on Medicaid and those incarcerated   We had a  2 billion budget deficit and have to balance the budget every year   she said   It s a zero sum game  For us to spend more on health means spending on K through 12 education has to go down  ImageTop executives of pharmaceutical companies testified at a Senate hearing last week about drug pricing CreditWin McNamee Getty ImagesEven with good profits assured  pharmaceutical companies are hesitant about schemes like the Netflix model  they re wary of doing anything that could put a crack in a system that has served them well  and hope to ride out public anger at high prices   Spokesmen for Gilead and AbbVie  the two largest makers of hep C drugs  declined to be interviewed   But Dr  Gee carefully laid the groundwork  She held years of meetings  working with the National Governors Association and the National Academy of Medicine to build support  And in 2017 she explored asking the federal government to help in overriding patents by invoking a law that allows lower cost generic production  paying the patent holder fair compensation  Drugmakers hate this law  The federal government has used it frequently  including for products like tractor wheels and corn seeds  In the 1960s  the government invoked it often to obtain needed medicines  But the pharmaceutical industry has ensured  by using its formidable political powers  that it has not been used for drugs in recent years Still  the simple threat of seeking to override patents was a signal that Louisiana was serious   It got the attention of the industry   Dr  Gee said High prices are a major barrier to treatment  Another is a lack of liver specialists  Dr  Gee said that Louisiana now allows nonspecialists to prescribe hep C drugs  a switch that has been successful in Australia And Australia has long invested in harm reduction measures  like needle exchange  which has averted hundreds of thousands of infections and provided a path with which to work with injecting drug users  Dr  Gregory Dore  a professor and the head of the Viral Hepatitis Clinical Research Program at the Kirby Institute  said that Australia has so effectively reached this group that their treatment rates are higher than those of infected people who don t inject   That s the way public health is supposed to work   he said Hep C drugs could be just the beginning for the Netflix model  Several experts I talked to suggested naloxone  the drug that reverses opioid overdose  as a candidate  Others mentioned insulin and H I V  treatments The Netflix business model makes particular sense for hep C drugs  said Rachel Sachs  an associate professor of law at Washington University School of Law  Hep C is a communicable disease  so governments have a strong public health interest in treating as many patients as possible  With widespread treatment  hep C could be eradicated   That rarely comes along and is important to pursue as a public health matter   she said  referring to the possibility of eradication  Another advantage is that several companies make hep C cures  she said  Companies will not want to let a competitor take the market and so they may bid just to avoid being shut out  She said that without the public health rationale and competition  it might be more difficult for a government to get drug companies to participate in Netflix style schemes  The Netflix model is an example of delinkage  pricing schemes that decouple rewards for pharmaceutical innovation from a drug s price  Another example is to offer a drugmaker a big prize for new drugs that matter to society  Prize funds could provide lower prices  broaden access to medicines and incentivize the creation of important drugs rather than big selling drugs  Senator Bernie Sanders regularly introduces the Medical Innovation Prize Fund Act and another bill proposing a fund for H I V  drugs  The legislation goes nowhere There s one category of drugs where delinkage is no longer controversial  and that s antibiotics  The world desperately needs more antibiotics  as even some second line ones are failing because of overuse  But any new antibiotic must be used extremely sparingly   only when all current antibiotics fail   in order to stave off its own failure  The current pricing model rewards selling as much as possible  which is the opposite of what you want  That s why we haven t seen a new class of antibiotics in 30 years A prize fund could persuade companies to work on antibiotics  Democratic legislators regularly introduce a bill to lower medicine costs that includes a  2 billion prize for new antibiotics  A different  bipartisan bill would reward a company that makes a new class of antibiotics with a year s patent extension on another of its drugs   potentially worth billions Less dramatically  there s an organization named CARB X  for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria  founded in 2016 at Boston University School of Law  CARB X members include the United States  British and German governments  foundations like Gates and the British Wellcome Trust  and a network of scientific and business experts  It offers funding and scientific and business help to small companies  Kevin Outterson  a law professor who directs CARB X  said six companies are already in human trials with new drugs The new ingredient in all this is public outrage  which can help apply a counterweight to the might of the pharmaceutical industry  Political will matters   Australia said we re not going to settle for 10 percent coverage   said Dr  Moon  the lead author of the study of Australia s program   We re going to find a way to 100 percent  If other governments were to follow that course of action  they d get results  too  Tina Rosenberg won a Pulitzer

BEAUREGARD  Ala    Standing near the slab that s all that is left of one family s garage  President Donald Trump on Friday surveyed the devastation wrought by a powerful tornado that ripped through a rural Alabama town  uprooting trees  tearing homes from their foundations and killing nearly two dozen people  We saw things that you wouldn t believe   said Trump  overlooking a debris field strewn with branches and other wreckage in Beauregard  which bore the brunt of Sunday s storm  Mangled metal siding  wood planks  piping and electric wires lay strewn on the ground  along with remnants of everyday life  clothing  a sofa  a bottle of Lysol cleaner and a welcome mat encrusted with dirt Trump and the first lady spent the afternoon meeting with survivors  victims  families and volunteers trying to rebuild after the massive tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide  killing 23 people  including four children and a couple in their 80s  with ten victims belonging to a single extended family The trip was a familiar one for Trump  who  now in the third year of his presidency  has traveled to the sites of numerous disasters and tragedies  including hurricanes  shootings and wildfires The day began with an aerial survey of the area by helicopter  which flew over swaths of land where trees had been flattened  Trump and his wife  Melania  also visited a church serving as a makeshift disaster relief center for survivors  He later observed a moment of silence before white wooden crosses commemorating each of the victims Head bowed  Trump and his wife held hands as they paused in front of each of the markers  Trump shook his head as he stood in front of one  which had been decorated with a tiny pair of children s sneakers Trump has  at times  struggled with his role as consoler in chief during trips to survey damage and meet with tragedy victims  He memorably tossed paper towels into a crowd as he surveyed damage following hurricanes in Puerto Rico   a move that some saw as inappropriate given the circumstances   and marveled at a yacht that floodwaters had deposited on a family s property during a trip to the Carolinas  At least you got a nice boat out of the deal   Trump told the family  He was caught on camera telling a person to whom he had just handed food to  have a good time  This time  however  Trump appeared to avoid any such distractions aside from some hubbub caused by his decision to sign Bibles  which Providence Baptist Church had been distributing  along with clothing and other supplies  including diapers  toiletries and personal care products Before signing autographs or posing for photos with the volunteers there  Trump thanked law enforcement officials and other first responders  as well as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency  which is assisting state and local response efforts  I wanted to come the day it happened   he said  adding that Gov  Kay Ivey had asked him to wait Before leaving the church  Trump posed for a photograph with a fifth grade volunteer and signed the child s Bible  said Ada Ingram  a local volunteer  Ingram said the president also signed her sister s Bible The pastor  Rusty Sowell  said the president s visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover  This is a marathon  not a sprint   Sowell said Earlier  Trump spent time with three families who lost loved ones  hearing their stories and dispensing hugs  He also met privately with survivors and family members  including a woman mourning the loss of 10 relatives  What they ve been through is incredible   Trump said after emerging from the meeting Before Trump arrived in Beauregard  Renee Frazier stood amid bricks and lumber that used to be her mother s home and waved as the helicopter carrying Trump passed overhead  Minutes before  Frazier  whose mother survived the tornado  had been arguing with relatives who opposed Trump s visit  calling it more about politics than compassion Frazier disagreed  I want the president here to see what happened to my mom s house   she said   I want him right here on this land because my mom is about love and unity  Down the road  where several people died  Trump supporter Bobby Spann said he hoped the president had learned  how to be a Southerner and how to respect people  during his brief visit Spann said he also hoped Trump realized how much help is needed  Houses need to be replaced  You can t help the dead folks  but you can try to help the ones that s still living   said Spann  chewing on a yellowroot twig  The tornado had partially peeled away the roof of Spann s mobile home Trump had said before the visit that he d instructed FEMA to give Alabama  the A Plus treatment  as it recovers   rhetoric that stood in contrast to Trump s response to disasters on less politically friendly territory  Alabama supported Trump by a wide margin in the 2016 presidential election  and he carried about 60 percent of the vote in Lee County  where Beauregard is located  Blue Trump flags flying outside homes are a frequent sight in the town  and many were seen waving Friday In the months after wildfires scorched California  a Democrat led state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016  Trump threatened to cut off federal aid unless the state embraced forest management policies he championed He also engaged in a sustained back and forth with lawmakers from hurricane whipped Puerto Rico  whose pro statehood governor identifies as a Democrat  Trump repeatedly blamed the U S  territory for its problems and noted how much money recovery efforts had cost the federal government The administration also considered redirecting disaster aid from those places to pay for Trump s long promised border wall but ultimately decided to target other funding sources    Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report    
WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s 2020 budget proposal will include  100 million for a global women s fund spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump The White House said the budget  expected to be released Monday  will include the funding for the Women s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative  The administration last month launched the government wide project  which she leads In a statement to The Associated Press  Ivanka Trump noted that Friday was International Women s Day and stressed the initiative was  working towards our goal of economically empowering 50 million women in developing countries by 2025   She says the budget includes  a new  100 million commitment  for the fund The new initiative involves the State Department  the National Security Council and other agencies  as it aims to coordinate current programs and develop new ones to help women in areas such as job training  financial support and legal or regulatory reforms The funding will come through the U S  Agency for International Development  which initially set up a  50 million fund for the effort using already budgeted money  The initiative will also be supported by programs across the government  as well as private investment Trump has previously sought to cut USAID s budget  His full 2020 plans were not available Friday The White House also is expected to announce that the president will nominate Kelley Eckels Currie to serve as an ambassador at large for global women s issues  That position  established under President Barack Obama s administration  had been vacant since Trump took office Ivanka Trump praised Currie  who currently serves as the representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council  She said Currie  is a formidable partner on women s economic empowerment and national security issues  Since Ivanka Trump joined her father s administration in early 2017  she has focused on women s economic issues 
BOSTON   Two civil rights organizations sued the Trump administration Friday on behalf of 15 Liberian immigrants over the president s decision to end a humanitarian program that allows them to live and work in the U S The Lawyers  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Lawyers for Civil Rights filed the lawsuit in federal court in Boston The lawsuit challenges President Donald Trump s decision in March 2018 to end the Deferred Enforced Departure program  which has been renewed by previous Democratic and Republican administrations  It is due to expire at the end of this month The lawsuit says the decision is unconstitutional and based on race  ethnicity and national origin  and would break apart families  Some of the Liberian immigrants have children who are U S  citizens  Defendant Trump has a history of bigoted remarks and actions that make clear that he holds racial animus against immigrants of color   according to the lawsuit The program protects about 4 000 Liberian immigrants who came from the African nation to escape environmental disasters  the Ebola virus and war  the organizations said An email seeking comment on the lawsuit was sent to the Justice Department  A memo signed by Trump last year says conditions in the country have improved  so the program is no longer needed  We will not stand idly by as immigrants of color are threatened with detention and deportation   said Ivan Espinoza Madrigal  executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights  in an emailed statement   We will not allow the Trump Administration to trample on our dignity and our constitutional rights  We will resist all forms of discrimination  and we will hold the Trump Administration accountable for attacking Liberian families  In addition to the 15 Liberian immigrants  the organizations African Communities Together and the UndocuBlack Network are named as plaintiffs Separately on Friday  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced an 18 month of extension of another blanket form of humanitarian relief called Temporary Protected Status for fewer than 100 people from South Sudan  The department said in a press release that  ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions  in the African nation justified the extension to Nov  2  2020 The decision was a mixed bag for South Sudanese because it applies only to those in the United States continuously since May 3  2016  More recent arrivals are ineligible The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status for several other countries but faces legal challenges  A federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration on withdrawing the benefit for people of El Salvador  Haiti  Nicaragua and Sudan    Associated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report 
WASHINGTON   Iowa hog farmer Howard Hill is feeling the pinch from President Donald Trump s get tough trade policies   his pigs are selling for less than it costs to raise them  It s a hit that Hill is willing to take for now  but his understanding also comes with a caution flag for the president  We have patience  but we don t have unlimited patience   says Hill  who raises about 7 000 hogs a year near the central Iowa town of Cambridge The president s willingness to pick trade fights with multiple trading partners at once has set off volleys of retaliatory tariffs  driving down the price of pork  corn and soybeans in political bellwether Iowa and elsewhere  and contributing to a 12 percent drop in net farm income nationally last year At issue are trade talks with China over intellectual property theft and a new U S  deal with Canada and Mexico to replace NAFTA that is awaiting congressional approval  Those efforts could take months to complete  So scores of farm and business groups are pressing for quicker relief  a stopgap step to help them out until the more comprehensive trade agreements are resolved  They re urging the administration to remove Canada and Mexico from the list of nations hit with a 25 percent tariff on steel shipped to the U S  and a 10 percent tariff placed on aluminum  Their hope is that action would give the U S  neighbors cause to remove retaliatory tariffs they placed on U S  goods  such as a 20 percent levy Mexico placed on U S  produced hams So far  the administration hasn t bit on that idea  but it dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Iowa this week to assure farmers that help is on the way For now  Trump is walking a political tightrope  Going to bat for steel and aluminum makers has endeared him to many voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania  where steel production is a matter of economic pride and legacy  but it could end up hurting him in ag heavy states like Iowa and Wisconsin that backed him in 2016 In Iowa  which casts the first votes of the presidential campaign season  state Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kauffmann said he s surprised by how patient farmers have been with Trump  The Trump Agriculture Department did approve up to  12 billion in assistance to help compensate farmers caught up in the tariff battle  They all say it s hurting   Kauffman said of the trade disputes   They re all saying the stopgap relief was definitely not a cure all  but they all understand what the president is trying to accomplish  It s quite an interesting phenomenon  But the defeat of two Republican House lawmakers in last year s midterm elections hints at some of the anxiety in farm country State Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said the political climate in the state has changed since Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by 9 percentage points in 2016  in part because of trade  These tariffs are kind of a slow burn  People are getting more and more frustrated   Price said   It s one of the reasons Donald Trump is going to lose Iowa in 2020  Some of the Democratic candidates for president are starting to differentiate themselves from Trump on trade when talking to Iowa voters  Sen  Kamala Harris of California has criticized the president s  go it alone  attitude  Former Rep  John Delaney of Maryland says  we re not going to succeed in the global economy by enacting protectionist policies  Still  some Democrats could have trouble seizing on the issue  Sen  Bernie Sanders of Vermont spent much of the 2016 campaign railing against the very trade deals that Trump denigrated  calling them  disastrous  for blue collar workers Sen  Charles Grassley  R Iowa  chairman of the Senate Finance Committee  is among the lawmakers urging the Trump administration to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs on products brought in from Canada and Mexico  He said it s a first step to getting the United States Mexico Canada Agreement through Congress  He also said it would improve the financial picture for farmers  Unfortunately we re starting to see more and more warning signs that farmers are running out of leeway with their bankers and landlords   Grassley said Pompeo sought to calm some of those nerves Monday even as he warned that Chinese theft of technology affects agriculture  too  The good news is this   help is on the way   Pompeo said   American producers and Chinese consumers will both be better off  The outcome of President Trump s trade negotiations currently under way will pay dividends for people in each of our two countries  Hill said he was encouraged by Pompeo s remarks  I think people recognize  particularly with China  they have not been playing by the rules for a long time   Hill said   I think producers are supportive of trying to correct these issues  On the other hand  we don t want it to go on forever  The American Farm Bureau Federation reports that Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies in the U S  went down in 2018 compared with prior year levels  But it also noted that farm debt is at a record high  and that lending standards are tighter and the cost of credit is rising  Certainly many farmers have liquidated assets to discharge debt  How much longer can many others endure remains a question   the farm group said 
WASHINGTON   On a three state tour this week to promote her child focused initiative   Be Best   Melania Trump showed that her time as first lady has sharpened an already sophisticated understanding of how to enhance her public image In a glossy and tightly controlled environment  Mrs  Trump restricted the majority of her interactions to emphasize motherhood   perhaps the only part of her private life that she has publicly embraced  In Tulsa  Okla   she had a heartwarming exchange with a child who dislikes homework  In Seattle  she spoke to assembled Microsoft executives about the challenges children face online  And onstage at a theater in Las Vegas  she shared a rare personal story about warning her 12 year old son  Barron  about the dangers of drug abuse  I try to explain how drugs are dangerous   Mrs  Trump said   and how they will mess up your head  mess up your body  and nothing positive comes of it  Mrs  Trump s tour firmed up her commitment to  Be Best   which addresses social media  well being and the opioid crisis  and which has faced setbacks from the start  The momentum of a Rose Garden debut in May was slowed when Mrs  Trump fell ill from a kidney condition soon afterward  And since then  she and her 12 person East Wing staff have had to deal with a departing policy director  a lengthy government shutdown  and countless chaotic news cycles engulfing President Trump s White House When Mrs  Trump embarked on this week s trip  she made it clear that she would not be talking about anything she deemed off topic when she ignored a reporter s shouted question about the testimony of Michael D  Cohen  her husband s former personal lawyer  Last week  Mr  Cohen told Congress that he deeply regretted lying to Mrs  Trump about an alleged affair between her husband and the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels ImageMrs  Trump watching science experiments at a school in Tulsa  Okla CreditPatrick Semansky Associated PressMrs  Trump instead tried to keep her message trained on  Be Best   But by Tuesday  the second and final day of her trip  she took a moment at the town hall style event in Las Vegas to chide the news media for dedicating time to other coverage besides the opioid crisis  I challenge the press to devote as much time to the lives lost and the potential lives that could be saved  by dedicating the same amount of coverage that you do to idle gossip or trivial stories   Mrs  Trump said The first lady did not specify which stories she considered unwelcome  but  like her husband  she pays close attention to her news coverage  poring over the headlines on social media  That private behavior tends to conflict with her public admonishments  Mrs  Trump has castigated the news media for focusing on her image  including matters of her personal style  despite relying on it as a powerful messaging tool   with mixed results   in the past Modern first ladies  said Anita McBride  who served as Laura Bush s chief of staff  have faced intense pressure to field questions about their private lives while trying to build substantive policy platforms without the luxury of a West Wing size staff  Mrs  Bush s National Book Festival survived  in part  because it was co opted by the Library of Congress  And several partners helped push along Michelle Obama s  Let s Move  initiative  including her efforts to find funding for salad bars in schools Even so  both women faced questions regarding anything but those platforms  It s not just her   Mrs  McBride said of Mrs  Trump   It s this constant focus on the clothes and the private life   But any first lady  she added  must endure scrutiny about what she called  that mystery behind the walls of the White House  In recent months  Mrs  Trump has continued to try to reinforce the idea that her behind the scenes efforts are more important than surface curiosities  In December  she hired Art Harding  who previously worked on policy issues at the United States Agency for International Development  to fill the role of policy director  Stephanie Grisham  Mrs  Trump s communications director  said in an email VideoOn a tour of three states this week  the first lady  Melania Trump  hasn t been able to avoid questions about the controversies surrounding her husband  At a town hall  she criticized the media for not dedicating enough time to covering the American opioid crisis CreditCreditEthan Miller Getty ImagesMs  Grisham said the East Wing was also working on partnerships that are meant to help Mrs  Trump s  Be Best  message endure  Those partners include Lily s Place  a West Virginia clinic that treats babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome  the National Institutes of Health and Microsoft The opioid crisis is one issue that administration officials and those close to the crisis say Mrs  Trump has succeeded in spotlighting Kellyanne Conway  the counselor to the president  said that Mrs  Trump decided to fold the subject of opioids into her portfolio in the summer of 2017  and has regularly been at the president s side since he declared the matter a public health emergency that fall  This is the one public policy issue that they work on together   Ms  Conway said   The first lady lending her voice and visibility is priceless currency  Others say Mrs  Trump s willingness to lend her image has led to a noticeable increase in awareness around neonatal abstinence syndrome  a condition in which babies are born in opioid withdrawal   one suffering from the condition is born every 15 minutes  according to government statistics As deaths from drug overdoses skyrocket  the Trump administration s handling of opioid addiction has not escaped the reaches of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  which announced on Wednesday that it would hold a hearing to determine if the White House had been deficient in its approach to national drug policy  Even so  Jessica Hulsey Nickel  the founder of Addiction Policy Forum  a group of organizations working to elevate awareness of the opioid crisis  said Mrs  Trump s work was a  gift  for people struggling to find resources ImageMrs  Trump in Las Vegas  On her tour this week  she restricted the majority of her interactions to emphasize motherhood CreditBrendan Smialowski Agence France Presse   Getty Images To pay attention and to shine a spotlight on the moms and babies affected by this disease who are often overlooked   Ms  Hulsey Nickel said   that s important and it deserves recognition  As she closed out her  Be Best  tour in Las Vegas  Mrs  Trump shared her thoughts on the opioid crisis with Eric Bolling  a friend of the Trumps whose son died after an accidental opioid overdose in 2017  Mr  Bolling said that interest in the town hall style events he hosts as part of an initiative by Sinclair Broadcast Group  the country s largest broadcaster   blows up  when he is able to announce Mrs  Trump s participation  You can probably fake a lot of things  a lot of initiatives   Mr  Bolling said   But you cannot fake empathy  In the end  even Mr  Bolling could not resist asking Mrs  Trump a round of personal questions  She told him that her days involve renovation projects   including the White House bowling alley   overseeing the White House residence staff  working with the White House Historical Association and managing her son s schedule Mr  Bolling s comparatively casual line of questioning prompted dozens of off topic headlines  including those that focused on the preferred Trump family dish   spaghetti  Mrs  Trump guessed   over the importance of the opioid crisis After Mrs  Trump returned home  the East Wing chided the news media for veering off topic 
Doug Mills  a staff photographer for The Times  has been covering the White House since 1983  He spoke with James Estrin this week about photographing President Trump after he returned from covering the Hanoi summit with Kim Jong un  The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity Q  How much time do you usually have when you photograph the president A  With previous administrations  going back to Reagan  you were in a cabinet room for maybe two or three or four minutes  With Trump you can be in there up to 90 minutes  What does that mean photographically Sometimes you feel like you re a fly on the wall because you can pretty much move around the room  change angles and change lenses  You can study him and look for other people in the room ImageMr  Trump with the North Korean leader  Kim Jong un  in Singapore  June 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesImageMr  Trump joined the national anthem at the national college football championship game in Atlanta  January 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesHow was this most recent trip to the Hanoi summit On a foreign trip  there are a lot more variables  but nobody thought the president would answer questions when he was sitting next to Kim Jong un  and certainly nobody expected that Kim Jong un would actually respond to a U S  reporter s question  So we were in there a little more than we expected It was negotiated that we could preset and wait for them to come into the room  That brought the temperature down so there wasn t a complete scrum  I don t think President Trump likes seeing the scrums either but they happen  no matter what  with everybody But this one had more decorum and more formality   plus the North Korean photographers and the Americans were in different positions The North Korean photographers like to be elevated because President Trump is taller than Kim Jong un   so most of the U S  still photographers  there were four of us  knelt down and the North Koreans stood above us  or up on ladders  so Trump wouldn t look like he was so much taller Are you concerned how the president might react to your pictures President Trump obviously is a very visual person and he looks at The New York Times daily and online  and on Twitter  So he knows the pictures that I m producing  People ask  does that make me think twice about taking pictures that are not flattering  and my answer is no He s told me about pictures that he hasn t liked of mine on a couple of different occasions  He s very camera conscious  But he still makes compliments about me or my work I appreciate his recognizing good and fair photography and I think that s what I do  I have no agenda  and I photograph what s in front of me  and it doesn t matter whether I think he looks flattering or not flattering  or he looks upset or he looks happy   that s irrelevant to me My job while I m in with the president at any event is to try to capture the most storytelling photograph  If it s a meeting that is jovial or happy  then it s going to show in the pictures  But if he s upset or frustrated or angry then those pictures will reflect that ImageMr  Trump with his wife  Melania  at an

TimesImageMr  Trump at a news conference in the White House after the midterm elections  November 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesIs photographing this president different in any ways from the previous four you ve photographed Obama was the most photogenic president I ve covered  and Trump is the most iconic  No matter where you see Trump  what light you see him in  what situation we photograph him in  you know right away it s him  Whether it s the hair  his tall stature  his black jackets  the 45 embroidered on his shirts  You just know it s him We have more access to him than we ever had to any other president that I ve covered  Much more  We re in photo ops much longer  He knows the power of driving the news cycle  And he does that day in and day out  and in order for him to do that we have to have access to him  He can drive it with Twitter  but if there s a huge story going out that may not be positive to him  all of a sudden we re in and there s something else going on When I photographed him in New York before he was president I found that he was very conscious about camera angles  He knows exactly what our job is There was a controversy with Obama when there were fewer and fewer events that the press were allowed into and more situations where his photographer was taking pictures  That s not what s happening with Trump  is it  The Obama folks had a knack for controlling President Obama s image  and circumvented the media by going around us through Twitter  Facebook and Instagram  There were a lot of situations that we normally would photograph but they chose to use their government photographer to photograph the event and then put it out on social media There was a lot of criticism from photographers who covered Obama as well as the White House Correspondents Association and the White House News Photographers AssociationTrump calls the media fake news  and particularly criticizes The New York Times and The Washington Post  yet photographically you are having more access than with previous presidents you ve covered It does bother me when I hear him say that  because I know there s nothing about my photographs that are fake  We are just there doing our jobs  Clearly I don t think The New York Times is putting out any fake news ImageMrs  Trump during a trip to Cairo  October 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesImageMr

Pittsburgh  January 2018 CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesWhen you have access to him it s also less controlled in some ways He is not very controlled  His aides can try to control an event  but President Trump will undoubtedly do something unexpected  He s not a politician and he is not somebody who has been groomed by handlers  So he is more likely to go off script  more likely to be himself  more likely to do things that are not done by traditional politicians  like letting us in for a cabinet room for 90 minutes You re on the White House Correspondents Association board  What do you do I am the representative for the still photographers  And that includes all of the camera and sound people  I am constantly in contact with people who are making decisions about the media at the White House so all of us can do our jobs better and have as much access as we can as a group You ve covered George W  Bush  President Obama  and President Trump for The Times  Before that you also  for The Associated Press  covered Clinton  George H W  Bush  and Reagan  How has it been different covering each of them Every administration is different  You try to build a relationship of trust with every administration   that they know you re doing your job fairly and have no agenda  Every administration  every president  treats photographers differently Reagan was an actor  so when he went on stage he had this charisma and he would light up  His personality just grew as he spoke and as he gestured Bush 41 had one of the closest relationships with photographers because he was vice president for eight years before becoming president  He knew a lot of us by first names and had a nickname for us   photo dogs   He would invite us to play horseshoes with him and to go jogging with him  He wasn t trying to play us  that was just his personality  He respected what we did When Clinton came in it was a totally different feel  We had plenty of access  He was very energetic and never stopped working  He loved rope lines  knew they made for great pictures and he seemed to get energy from going into a crowd and staying there for 30 40 minutes shaking hands after an event His relationship with photographers was not as close as it was with Bush 41 and after the Lewinsky scandal there was less access Because of his dad  Bush 43 really liked photographers  He d also call us photo dogs  He was very athletic and would invite photographers to bike ride with him  He liked to hang out and talk to reporters and photographers at times  just to feel them out  mostly off the record while on the plane or at social events  He was a lot of fun to photograph  He didn t have the stage presence of other presidents  but he was a character and would do things that made for good pictures Obviously 9 11 was important in his presidency  That really drove the image of him being a strong president  although he was the first president I ever saw cry in the Oval Office ImageHouse

of the people  Yes  that s disturbing to me Yet he speaks well of you during the summit with Kim last week  where he said you are  one of the best photographers in the world  I think he obviously

WASHINGTON   A group of 23 Democratic and one Republican senators asked President Donald Trump Thursday to protect Venezuelan citizens currently in the United States from deportation  given the crisis rocking the South American country The 24 senators  including Democratic leader Chuck Schumer  asked Trump to designate Venezuelans for Temporary Protected Status  TPS   Florida s Marco Rubio is the only Republican in the group The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment Trump administration officials have moved to discontinue that specific protection for many countries  but a federal judge extended it last week for people from Sudan  Nicaragua  Haiti and El Salvador while a preliminary injunction remains in effect Several lawsuits have been filed to avoid the termination of the TPS program  Granting TPS to Venezuela is a concrete measure your Administration can immediately take to alleviate the suffering of innocent Venezuelan civilians and to demonstrate our nation s commitment to supporting a safe democratic transition in Venezuela so that individuals can safely return home soon   the senators wrote in a letter TPS is granted to countries ravaged by natural disasters or war and lets citizens of those countries remain in the U S  until the situation improves back home  About 300 000 people have received those protections The economy of the oil rich nation has shrunk by more than half since 2013  according to International Monetary Fund data  Hyperinflation and shortages of food and other necessities have driven at least 3 million Venezuelans out of their country  according to the United Nations The U S  and more than 50 governments recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president of the country They say President Nicolas Maduro wasn t legitimately re elected last year because opposition candidates weren t permitted to run The letter comes a week after five senators introduced a bill to immediately grant TPS for eligible Venezuelans U S  Special Envoy to Venezuela Elliot Abrams told reporters earlier this week   We have no U S  Government decision  All I can say is we are aware of the problem     
WASHINGTON   Congressional Democrats said on Wednesday that a U S  government agency was responding too slowly to their requests for documents about the Trump administration s abandonment of a plan to move the FBI out of its headquarters near President Donald Trump s downtown Washington hotel  Compliance with the requests has been  woefully inadequate   said the Democratic chairs of five House of Representatives committees in a letter to Emily Murphy  chief of the General Services Administration  GSA   the federal property agency Before he became president in January 2017  Trump supported moving the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters to the suburbs of Washington  said Democrats looking into the matter They said that after Republican Trump was elected and disqualified from bidding to acquire the site for commercial development  however  he switched his position Trump s about face would  block potential competitors from developing the existing property on Pennsylvania Avenue across the street from the Trump Hotel   the Democrats said Their inquiry is one of numerous investigations into the president  his administration and his businesses  ranging from his efforts to build a skyscraper in Moscow to whether he has obstructed justice in a probe of his 2016 election campaign s ties to Russia The Trump International Hotel on historic Pennsylvania Avenue is across the street from the FBI s J  Edgar Hoover building  a decaying concrete fortress completed in 1974 that is today too small for the agency Plans to move the FBI to the Washington suburbs were abruptly canceled by the Trump administration in 2017  Democrats have subsequently raised questions about a possible Trump conflict of interest Trump favors replacing the old FBI building with a new structure on the same site The Democratic lawmakers also questioned  why the White House and GSA allowed President Trump to participate directly in a decision that affects his own personal financial interests  The GSA had no immediate comment  The White House did not respond to a request for comment The committee heads said that in October they requested eight categories of documents related to the planned FBI headquarters move At a meeting with GSA officials in December  the Democrats said  the agency produced a few  highly redacted documents  covering a  narrow time period  but that the agency has  produced no additional documents since that time   The Democrats said that if the GSA failed to comply with their latest request  they will be  forced to consider alternative means to obtain compliance   Some of the committee heads have subpoena power   Reporting by Mark Hosenball  editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Grant McCool 
BEIJING   A senior Chinese trade official called on Saturday for a compromise between the United States and China that could make a trade deal easier to reach this spring  But it could also lead to a more fragile agreement  which could fall apart quickly should trade frictions rise again Over the past year  the most contentious issue in the countries  trade talks has been the Trump administration s demand for what it calls an enforcement provision  which would allow the United States to monitor China s behavior and put penalties in place if the Chinese violated the deal The Trump administration has pressed China to accept an agreement allowing the United States to unilaterally reimpose tariffs if it concludes that China has not gone through with structural changes to its economy  In the past month  the administration has also pushed for a broader enforcement mechanism  which would include the right to reimpose tariffs for any category of goods in which imports from China surge In exchange  the Trump administration would roll back at least some of the tariffs it placed on  250 billion of imports from China that it imposed last year  penalties that have strained ties between the governments  rocked financial markets and thrown the future of companies that operate in both countries in doubt Chinese officials have strongly resisted the idea of an enforcement provision  They worry that the Trump administration  or future ones  could invoke it at any time to restart trade frictions ImageChina s vice minister of commerce  Wang Shouwen  right  said on Saturday that Beijing could accept a deal giving each side an equal right to take trade actions against the other CreditFred Dufour Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBut Wang Shouwen  China s vice minister of commerce for international trade negotiations  raised a possible compromise at a news conference in Beijing on Saturday morning  He said China would be amenable to an agreement that gave each side an equal right to take trade actions against the other side after an agreement was struck  Any implementation mechanism must go in both directions  fair and equal   Mr  Wang said  using China s preferred term for an enforcement mechanism  He spoke at an annual news conference given by the Chinese Commerce Ministry s top officials  in conjunction with the 11 day session of the country s rubber stamp legislature  the National People s Congress Mr  Wang did not address another aspect of the enforcement question that has deeply divided the United States and China  While the Trump administration wants the right to reimpose tariffs unilaterally  China s Commerce Ministry has favored creating a lengthy process of bilateral consultations if either side has a grievance In testimony before Congress on Feb  27  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  outlined a possible method for enforcing the deal under which the two sides would hold a regular series of meetings at multiple levels of government  and  if China violated the agreement  American tariffs would spring back into force The details of that proposal aren t fully clear  But some American businesses are wary of a deal that would only allow them to air complaints through the government  as Mr  Lighthizer s description seemed to suggest  They said such an arrangement could be time consuming and ultimately lack the capacity to address many of the problems faced by the thousands of American companies operating in China Other trade deals that the United States has signed in the past have included different methods that companies could use to resolve problems  like a special court for investors  But the Trump administration has been suspicious of those kinds of arrangements  viewing them as a potential infringement on American sovereignty ImagePresident Trump and President Xi Jinping of China in Beijing in 2017  Mr  Wang  the Chinese official  would not say whether the two might meet in Florida this month to seal a deal CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesAmerican businesses also contend that having the main penalty for violating the agreement be the reimposition of tariffs risks creating lasting uncertainty  The companies are now weighing whether to continue to invest in China or whether the prospect of additional levies would make it less risky to move operations abroad As long as the threat of tariffs looms  the United States and China could resolve their differences in the coming months  only to find themselves back in a similar stalemate next year  We could definitely see ourselves in yet another period of uncertainty   said Erin Ennis  senior vice president of the U S  China Business Council Mr  Wang did not answer a question about whether Mr  Trump and President Xi Jinping might meet in Florida this month to seal a trade deal  Tentative plans for such a summit meeting have been put in doubt by continued disagreement over an enforcement mechanism  and over what limits China might accept on its ability to subsidize high tech manufacturing If the two sides agree on an enforcement provision that covers import surges  it might be more useful to the United States Research by Brad Setser  who was a Treasury economist in the Obama administration and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York  has found broad stagnation in American exports of manufactured goods over the past few years  a possible sign of eroding American competitiveness  By contrast  Chinese exports to countries all over the world have been surging China wants the United States to remove all of the extra tariffs that Mr  Trump imposed last year  That would leave China with its average tariffs of 7 5 percent on imports from all over the world  compared to 5 percent for the European Union and 3 percent for the United States China contends that it is still a developing country and therefore should not have to operate under the same trade rules as the West  Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at the news conference on Saturday that any reform of the World Trade Organization  which the Trump administration has sought to overhaul  should respect the different needs of developing countries Mr  Trump has promised an ambitious agreement that would address ever rising American trade deficits with China at a time when Beijing poses a growing geopolitical challenge to the United States  China has built the world s largest navy and an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea  and it has tried to promote its combination of single party authoritarianism and state led economic growth as a global alternative to democracy and free markets But the overall United States trade deficit  and specifically its deficit with China  further increased last year  Congressional Democrats have become increasingly critical of Mr  Trump on trade in recent days  accusing him of having become too willing to accept a weak deal just to have an agreementMr  Trump and his advisers continued to present a tough front on Friday  even as the president predicted a jump in the stock market if a trade deal were to be reached   If this isn t a great deal  we won t make a deal   he added Mr  Wang said there had been progress during trade talks last month in Washington   and at least one moment of harmony  Vice Premier Liu He of China ordered a hamburger  while Mr  Lighthizer had a Chinese dish  chicken with eggplant sauce  Mr  Wang said the two men turned down offers of tea and coffee  They were both

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump will be making a significant request for border wall funds and seeking money to stand up Space Force as a new branch of the military in the White House budget being released next week  an administration official said Friday For the first time  Trump plans to stick with the strict spending caps imposed years ago  even though lawmakers have largely avoided them with new budget deals  That will likely trigger a showdown with Congress The official said the president s plan promises to balance the budget in 15 years Trump will seek  750 billion for defense  a boost for the military  while cutting non defense discretionary spending by 5 percent  said the official  who was unauthorized to discuss the document ahead of its release and spoke on condition of anonymity Budgets are mainly seen as blueprints for White House priorities  But they are often panned on Capitol Hill  where lawmakers craft the appropriation bills that eventually fund the government  if the president signs them into law Trump s budget for the 2020 fiscal year will increase requests for some agencies while reducing others to reflect those priorities  Reductions are proposed  for example  for the Environmental Protection Agency The official said Congress has ignored the president s spending cuts for too long  The federal budget is bloated with wasteful spending  the official said  and the administration remains committed to balancing the budget The cuts being requested by the White House would hit discretionary spending as well as some mandatory safety net programs  which Trump has proposed in the past  Many Republicans are often eager to reduce government spending  but Congress has had trouble passing bills that seriously slash the safety net programs used by many Americans Budgets often rely on various accounting measures to achieve desired results  This one  for example  counts  546 billion in defense money as a base  but another  174 billion in another account to keep within caps And while the budget will suggest it balances in future years  it is also expected to rely on projections for continued economic growth from the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017  But there s no guarantee that would cover the lost tax revenues By proposing spending levels that don t raise the budget caps  the president is courting a debate with Congress  Lawmakers from both parties have routinely agreed to raise spending caps established by a previous deal years ago to fund the government Trump  though  has tried to resist those deals  He threatened to veto the last one reached in 2017 to prevent a shutdown  Late last year  a fight over border wall funds sparked the 35 day shutdown that spilled into this year and became the longest in history 
One of President Trump s lead Middle East peace negotiators lashed out at the Palestinian Authority on Friday  accusing it of institutionalizing support for terrorism amid a dispute over Israeli tax transfers that make up a significant portion of Palestinian revenues Under longstanding accords  Israel makes monthly transfers to the Palestinian Authority from certain taxes it collects related to Palestinians  Last month  Israel announced a freeze on about 5 percent of the tax payout  as punishment for the Palestinian Authority s policy of paying stipends to Palestinian prisoners in Israel and to the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in confrontations with Israelis In response  and despite the authority s financial problems  the Palestinian president  Mahmoud Abbas  rejected the full tax transfer and vowed to continue to pay the stipends On Friday  the Trump administration s Middle East envoy  Jason D  Greenblatt  accused Palestinian leaders of offering the stipends as a reward for acts of terrorism  If your citizens were being routinely attacked by terrorists  which of you would tolerate a reward system that compensated the attackers for their crimes   he wrote in one tweet   How can we possibly censure Israel for taking the same stance  Mr  Greenblatt was in New York on Friday for discussions on the dispute in a closed door session of the United Nations Security Council  which apparently failed to break the impasse Mansour al Otaibi  Kuwait s ambassador to the United Nations  told reporters after the session that most members of the Security Council  overwhelmingly  considered the Israeli decision  unacceptable   This is Palestinian money   he said   They have the right  the Palestinians  to do whatever they want with their money  The tax revenues are generated from the earnings of Palestinian day laborers and merchants who do business in Israel  and from customs duties on Palestinian imports through Israeli ports  But the payouts  which some critics have dubbed a  pay to slay  policy  have long been a source of controversy in Israel In July  the Israeli Knesset  or Parliament  approved legislation that would allow the government to withhold a portion of the tax revenue  which makes up about 7 percent of the Palestinian Authority s annual budget The Palestinian Authority s refusal to accept any of the revenues only adds to its financial woes  It was already struggling after a decision last year by the Trump administration to cut funding for a United Nations agency that provides assistance to millions of Palestinians The Trump administration s hard line tactics have been led by the president s son in law and adviser Jared Kushner  in an effort to force Palestinians to return to the negotiating table and drop many of their longstanding demands  Such discussions have largely been paused while Mr  Kushner and Mr  Greenblatt put the finishing touches on a long awaited peace plan Their eventual proposal  however  could be dead on arrival  The Palestinian Authority has refused to discuss the plan with American negotiators  in protest over the Trump administration s decision in December 2017 to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and move the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv 
COLUMBUS  Ohio   Vice President Mike Pence highlighted curbs in environmental regulations and called energy a  source of prosperity  during a speech in Ohio s capital city of Columbus Pence  speaking Friday at the Ohio Oil and Gas Association convention  also hailed President Donald Trump s decision to issue an executive order to pay for building a wall at the U S  Mexican border  Pence said stopping drug smuggling will save lives in Ohio  a state hard hit by the opioid crisis Pence boasted about Trump administration energy policies to include withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord  eliminating rules on hydraulic fracturing  cutting stream protections and rolling back methane regulations The former Republican governor from Indiana earned a standing ovation by telling the gathering   America will never be a socialist country  
WASHINGTON   Donald Trump heard words from a judge that the judge didn t speak  as the president reached to denounce the Russia investigation as a hoax and celebrate an exoneration he wasn t given  Democrats persisted in assailing the Trump administration for putting migrant children in the same type of holding facilities used when Barack Obama was president A look at some of the political rhetoric over the past week TRUMP INVESTIGATIONSTRUMP   Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia     tweet Friday about the case of his former campaign chairman THE FACTS  This did not happen  loudly  quietly or at all The case in Virginia was not related to Manafort s work on the Trump campaign and did not take up the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election  Manafort was convicted for tax and bank fraud related to his own work advising Ukrainian politicians Judge T S  Ellis III neither cleared nor implicated the president  Ellis emphasized that Manafort was  not before this court for anything having to do with collusion with the Russian government     TRUMP  Manafort s lawyer  went out of his way to make a statement last night  no collusion with Russia  There was absolutely none  The judge  I mean for whatever reason  I was very honored by it  also made the statement that this had nothing to do with collusion with Russia  So you know  keep it going  Keep the hoax going     remarks to reporters before visiting Alabama on Friday THE FACTS  Trump is misquoting Manafort s lawyer  Kevin Downing  who did not say there was no collusion with Russia  Downing only argued that no evidence emerged in the trial that his client  in particular  was involved in any collusion  The judge did say the trial was not about Russia but that was not a statement of vindication for Trump or anyone  It was a reflection of the nature of the unrelated charges against Manafort Whether the campaign and Russia worked together to tilt the election toward Trump is a core issue in special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation  which continues Like other Americans close to the president who have been charged in the Mueller probe  Manafort hasn t been accused of involvement in Russian election interference  But he has not been cleared of that suspicion  either For example  court papers in recent weeks revealed that Manafort shared polling data related to the campaign with Konstantin Kilimnik  a business associate U S  authorities say is tied to Russian intelligence  A Mueller prosecutor has said that an August 2016 meeting between Manafort and Kilimnik goes to the  heart  of the Russia probe    TRUMP  on turning over documents requested by congressional committees   President Obama  from what they tell me  was under a very similar kind of a thing   didn t give one letter  They didn t do anything  They didn t give one letter of the request  Many requests were made  they didn t give a letter     remarks Tuesday THE FACTS  Not true  The Obama administration gave Congress hundreds of thousands of pages of documents requested in oversight investigations The Obama White House turned over tens of thousands of documents to the Republican led investigation of the deadly attack on the U S  diplomatic mission in Benghazi  Libya  for example  and the State Department released hundreds of Hillary Clinton s emails from that time  when she was secretary of state  The Obama administration also gave Congress volumes on the collapse of the solar energy firm Solyndra  It resisted turning over documents on the botched Operation Fast and Furious gun trafficking probe until a court forced it to release them to Congress  It is a false and ridiculous claim that we didn t respond to oversight requests from Congress during the Obama administration   Andy Wright  who helped manage those requests in the Obama White House  told The Associated Press Trump was responding to a House Judiciary Committee effort to get documents from 81 federal agencies  people and organizations as part of an investigation into possible obstruction of justice  corruption and abuse of power    CHILDREN IN CAGESREP  KATHLEEN RICE  Democrat of New York   It was a policy announced by the attorney general of this country that families were going to be separated  That was a policy  He did not say we re going to start enforcing a law  It was a policy by this administration that only ended when there were pictures of little kids in cages that had been ripped away from their parents     House hearing Wednesday REP  MARK GREEN  Republican of Tennessee   In regard to the child separation  and then we talked about the cages here  as I recall  the images that circulated around the internet were actually from the Obama administration  They later found out that the picture that circulated the internet of a child in a cage came from the time frame when it was the Obama administration     House hearing Wednesday THE FACTS  Green is correct  Some Democrats continue to evoke images of children in  cages  that spread online at the height of the family separation controversy and sparked rage over supposed Trump administration cruelty  But the pictures in question were taken by the AP in 2014 and depicted Obama administration detentions of children  They were widely misrepresented as illustrating Trump era detention The Border Patrol temporarily houses children who are apart from families in the same facilities used by the Obama administration  They are chain link enclosures inside buildings  which Democrats call cages The Homeland Security Department s inspector general testified to Congress this past week on conditions for detainees  John Kelly  the inspector general  faulted the department for keeping children for longer periods in facilities meant for short term detention  But he said the facilities his office inspected were in compliance with standards   The children had access to hygiene items and clean bedding   he said   We did not encounter issues with temperature or ventilation  access to emergency medical care  supervision or access to phones   He said  children had access to food and snacks and did not complain of hunger  In stark contrast  he reported unhealthy and unsafe conditions in four or five Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities used for adults Immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases   serious criminal charges against a parent  concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns  That policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance Trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally    VETERANSTRUMP   No administration has accomplished   probably  you could say this with absolute surety   in the first two years anywhere near what we have accomplished  Whether it s the tax cuts  whether it s regulation cuts  whether it s the Veterans Administration   what we ve done with the Veterans Administration with Choice and so many other things that nobody thought would be possible to get passed     remarks Tuesday TRUMP   We re extremely proud of Choice  It s been many  many decades that they ve been trying to get Choice where a veteran can go out and see a doctor if the lines are long     remarks Tuesday THE FACTS  You wouldn t know from Trump s boasting that it was Obama who won passage of the Choice program  Trump is expanding the program  Its ultimate scope remains uncertain  in part because of questions of money    TRUMP   Supporting veterans in distress is a critical priority for our entire administration   everybody in the administration      Every VA medical center now offers same day emergency mental health care     remarks Tuesday THE FACTS  This may be the case  but again it happened before Trump took office  VA s effort to provide same day primary and mental health care when medically necessary at every VA medical center was publicized in April 2016  during the Obama administration  By late 2016  the department s blog announced that goal would be achieved by year s end A Dec  23  2016  article in the Harvard Business Review cites new same day services at all VA hospitals as evidence of notable progress at the department  Former VA secretary David Shulkin told Congress in late January 2017 the services already were fully in place

WASHINGTON   Trump administration officials have not made any new plans to send a team to China for face to face trade talks although there is much work left to be done to reach a deal  White House trade adviser Clete Willems said on Friday  We re talking to them  Chinese officials  every day  but no one s got any trip plans   Willems told reporters on the sidelines of a Georgetown Law School event  When asked about the prospect for future face to face meetings  he said   Maybe  But there are no plans right now  The governments of the world s two largest economies have been locked in a tit for tat tariff battle for months as Washington presses Beijing to address long standing concerns over Chinese practices and policies around industrial subsidies  technology transfers  market access and intellectual property rights Advances in talks drove the White House to indefinitely delay hikes in tariffs on  200 billion   153 6 billion  worth of Chinese imports that were set to kick in on March 2  Willems said the two countries had made progress in talks but that there was still much more to be done  He declined to say whether Trump would set a new tariff deadline should the talks stall Members of Congress and the business community have expressed concerns that Trump is so eager for a deal ahead of presidential elections next year that he may accept an agreement that falls short of addressing key structural issues Willems pushed back against such concerns  saying the notion that Trump will settle for a  bad deal  is  totally inaccurate  U S  Ambassador to China Terry Branstad told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that Washington and Beijing have yet to set a date for Trump to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping   a sign that neither side sees a deal as imminent  Both sides agree that there has to be significant progress  meaning a feeling that they re very close before that happens   Branstad told the newspaper in Beijing   We re not there yet  But we re closer than we ve been for a very long time  One complicating factor has been Xi s plans to visit Europe after a meeting of the National People s Congress ends next week The Journal  citing people familiar with China s thinking  also reported that after Trump s failed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month  Beijing officials won t commit to a summit until they are sure of a deal  Chinese officials were surprised Trump walked away from denuclearisation talks with Kim and do not want the same thing to happen to Xi  the newspaper said  For the Chinese  any summit would basically be a signing ceremony  it said Larry Kudlow  the top White House economic adviser  gave Fox Business Network an optimistic view of the progress so far  It is historic  it is written down  it was agreed to by the Chinese who were here two weeks ago  but it has to pass through the political filter of President Xi and the politburo   Kudlow said   Perhaps a meeting of the leaders later this month or in April  Perhaps  Kudlow said the emerging deal would provide  an end to the theft of intellectual property  through forced technology transfers and hacking of computer networks  We will get substantially lower tariffs  or maybe an end to tariffs on cars  commodities  agriculture  industrial supplies  We will get an enforcement procedure   he said  If the deal doesn t work for the United States  and our long term interests  whether it s technology  IP  theft  enforcement  commodities  tariffs     then it s not our deal    Reporting by David Lawder and Alexandra Alper  editing by Chizu Nomiyama  Jonathan Oatis and Sonya Hepinstall

NEW YORK   It s a  he said  he said  where the  he     no matter who he is    has a credibility problem The latest White House legal drama   whether or not the president s former legal fixer asked him for a pardon   has pulled back the curtain on a whole cast of characters whose comments can t always be taken at face value Michael Cohen  Trump s former attorney who denies asking for presidential intervention  has himself pleaded guilty to lying to Congress   to back up Trump s own stories  His representative  Lanny Davis  has repeatedly had to walk back and amend statements about what Cohen knew and when  But Davis  need to correct previous claims has only been topped by that of Rudy Giuliani  the Trump lawyer whose job description  at times  has seemed to be centered as much on fudging and on moving goalposts And then  of course  there is President Donald Trump  who declared for the first time on Friday that Cohen personally asked him for a pardon Trump s foes call him a liar and worse  He made dozens of misstatements in just one speech last weekend and is estimated  by one count  to have made more than 9 000 false or misleading statements since taking office So  in a production filled with unreliable narrators  who  if anyone  can be trusted  My take is that it s all a mess and I don t know if we re ever going to know what really happened   says former House Speaker Newt Gingrich  a Trump ally who acknowledged that the battle over pardons has left him baffled   It seems now that we live in an age of total confusion  The latest act in the Shakespearean tragedy   farce    over Cohen s fall from grace in Trumpworld came to light in the past week over a fierce debate as to whether the attorney had sought a pardon from the president after his office and hotel room were raided by the FBI last spring  Cohen  who spent a decade working for Trump before turning on him and cooperating with the special counsel investigating the president  testified before Congress last week that he had never sought a pardon from his former boss But in the days that followed  stories changed Davis  who was not Cohen s lawyer at the time  said Cohen  directed his attorney  to explore a possible pardon with Giuliani and others on Trump s legal team  a statement that appeared to contradict Cohen s sworn congressional testimony Then Giuliani said that two lawyers working for Cohen approached him about a pardon last spring  And Davis then allowed in a written statement Thursday that his client was  open to the ongoing  dangling  of a possible pardon by Trump representatives privately and in the media  in the months after the FBI raid Trump took it one step further on Friday  Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon  His lawyers totally contradicted him  He lied   Trump tweeted aboard Air Force One while en route to inspect damage from a deadly tornado in Alabama   Additionally  he directly asked me for a pardon  I said NO  He lied again  Cohen s turn  Just another set of lies by  POTUS  realdonaldtrump  Mr  President  he wrote  before invoking the women whose hush money payments he helped facilitate for candidate Trump   Let me remind you that today is  InternationalWomensDay  You may want use today to apologize for your own  lies and  DirtyDeeds to women like Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford  Cohen arranged payments to Clifford  who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels  and McDougal to prevent them from speaking publicly about alleged affairs with Trump Giuliani again He said in an interview Friday that he remembered Trump telling him when he joined the president s legal team eleven months ago that Cohen had asked for a pardon  something the former New York City mayor had never previously revealed  including in an interview about pardons the previous day This furor is far from the first time the players in this particular melodrama have  to put it charitably  arranged and rearranged their scripts Long before he entered politics  Trump embellished his record  posing as his own spokesman to plant flattering stories in New York gossip pages and declaring that the 58 story Trump Tower was actually 68 stories so it would be the tallest in that section of Midtown Manhattan  That track record continued during his campaign and as president  He trotted out big falsehoods   claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the United States and  later  that he wiretapped Trump Tower   and smaller ones  including when boasted that the crowd for his Inauguration was the largest in history His administration has had more than 9 000 misleading statements  according to The Washington Post   fake news  according to the president Cohen has become a key figure in congressional investigations since turning on his former boss  During last week s public testimony  he called Trump a con man  a cheat and a racist  Trump  in turn  said Cohen  is lying in order to reduce his prison time  Indeed  Cohen was known to lie to reporters during Trump s 2016 campaign  He is to begin a three year prison sentence in May for crimes  including lying to Congress   lying to support Trump s own statements about his real estate efforts in Russia Both men s lawyers   who act more as TV spokesmen then courtroom attorneys   have also struggled with keeping their facts straight  though sometimes the shifting stories appear to be deliberate efforts to create smoke screens rather than clear anything up  Davis  who served as White House counsel during President Bill Clinton s early crises  has had to walk back at least one bombshell assertion over the past year  that his client could tell investigators that Trump had advance knowledge of a Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign Giuliani has fumbled facts and repeatedly moved the goalposts about what sort of behavior by the president would constitute collusion or a crime  He has defended his scattershot approach with a series of memorable turns of phrases  including one that could act as a motto for many of those involved in the saga  Truth isn t truth   Giuliani has said

 Reuters    In a blow to the Trump administration s U S  Mexico border strategy  a federal court judge in California has expanded the number of migrant families separated at the border that the government may be required to reunite San Diego based U S  District Court Judge Dana Sabraw late on Friday issued a preliminary ruling that would potentially expand by thousands the number of migrants included in a class action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union Sabraw already ordered the Trump administration last year to reunite more than 2 800 migrant children who were separated from their parents at the U S  Mexico border under the administration s  zero tolerance  policy  But he will allow more separated families to join the class action lawsuit after a report released in January by the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  Inspector General  which identified potentially thousands more families that had been separated as early as July 1  2017  The administration s  zero tolerance  policy did not take effect until May 2018  The hallmark of a civilized society is measured by how it treats its people and those within its borders   Sabraw said in his ruling Sabraw said that report was  a significant development in this case  and its contents  are undisputed  The Justice Department did not immediately respond to calls for comment The administration of U S  President Donald Trump implemented the zero tolerance policy to criminally prosecute and jail all illegal border crossers   even those traveling with their children   which led to a wave of separations last year  The policy sparked outrage when it became public  and the backlash led Trump to sign an executive order reversing course on June 20  2018 The IG report said prior to the officially announced zero tolerance policy  the government began ramping up separations in 2017 for other reasons related to a child s safety and well being  including separating parents with criminal records or lack of proper documents A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said in January after the IG report came out that the practice of separating apprehended minors from adults to protect the interests of the children has been standard practice  for more than a decade  The report also said more than 100 minors  including more than two dozen under age 5  were separated after the President s executive order   The court made clear that potentially thousands of children s lives are at stake and that the Trump administration cannot simply ignore the devastation it has caused   Lee Gelernt  ACLU lead attorney in the class action family separation lawsuit  said on Friday   Reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington  Editing by Matthew Lewis 
 Reuters    The U S  Department of Labor issued a long awaited proposal on Thursday to extend mandatory overtime pay to a million more workers  far fewer than an Obama administration rule that was struck down by a federal judge Currently  salaried workers are automatically entitled to overtime pay only if they earn less than  23 660 a year  a figure set in 2004  The proposal released on Thursday would raise the threshold to  35 308 The Labor Department in 2016 doubled the salary threshold to about  47 000  extending mandatory overtime pay to about 4 million U S  workers  But a federal judge in Texas ruled the following year that the ceiling was set so high that it could sweep in some management workers who are supposed to be exempt from overtime pay protections  Business groups and 21 Republican led states had sued to challenge the 2016 rule  Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said in a statement that Thursday s proposal would  bring common sense  consistency  and higher wages to working Americans  Business groups have closely tracked changes to overtime pay regulations and were critical of the Obama era rule  Class action lawsuits alleging unpaid overtime are common  and companies often pay millions of dollars to settle them  A higher salary threshold could lead to more lawsuits  since many more workers would be covered by the federal law mandating overtime pay  Trade groups have also said a higher overtime threshold could push employers to cut some workers  hours The Labor Department called on Thursday for public comment on its proposed overtime threshold  as well as whether it should be periodically increased to reflect inflation  The Obama administration rule would have automatically raised the salary threshold every three years   Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany  New York  Editing by Peter Cooney 
WASHINGTON   The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Chad A  Readler of Ohio as President Trump s 33rd federal appeals court judge despite bipartisan criticism that as a Justice Department official in the Trump administration he had shirked his official responsibility to defend the Affordable Care Act when it was challenged in court Mr  Readler s nomination is just the latest to divide the Senate as Republicans renew their drive to fill federal district and circuit court vacancies while gearing up to force through a Senate rules change to accelerate the confirmation process for the remainder of Mr  Trump s tenure With the approval of Mr  Readler to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and two other appeals court nominees headed for a vote  Mr  Trump will have filled nearly 20 percent of the nation s appellate court judgeships  That is a pace well ahead of his predecessors and one that puts his stamp firmly on the federal judiciary  with nearly two years remaining in his term  President Barack Obama did not see his 33rd circuit judge confirmed until early in his second term The fight over Mr  Readler was intensified by his role in the legal struggle over the Affordable Care Act  which Democrats said he was obligated to defend as a top lawyer in the Justice Department s civil division because it was existing law  Instead  he filed a brief in support of a lawsuit by Republican attorneys general aimed at gutting the Affordable Care Act  and argued that it  and its protections against denying coverage for pre existing conditions  was unconstitutional The Trump administration has sought to repeal the law  but the effort failed and the law remains in place Mr  Readler s nomination was approved on a 52 to 47 vote with all Democrats and one Republican voting no  Senator Susan Collins of Maine  the sole Republican to speak out against Mr  Readler  cited his health care argument in opposing him  Rather than defend the law and its protections for individuals with pre existing conditions   such as asthma  arthritis  cancer  diabetes and heart disease   Mr  Readler s brief in Texas v  United States argued that they should be invalidated   she said Democrats seized on that issue  saying that while Senate Republicans proclaimed that they supported coverage for those with existing conditions  they were backing an architect of the Trump administration s attempt to dismantle the law  Tens of millions of Americans who need this protection are watching   said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader   A vote for Readler is very simply a vote for the lawsuit to strike down our health care law   Mr  Schumer noted that Mr  Readler was nominated for the court seat the day after his health care brief was filed  Apparently in the Trump administration depriving people of protections for pre existing conditions   it is something to be rewarded and rewarded no less with a lifetime appointment   he said One after the other  Democrats took to the floor to criticize the nomination  The depth of their opposition   and eagerness to highlight Mr  Readler s health care actions   was demonstrated by unusually strong opposition from Senator Joe Manchin III  Democrat of West Virginia  who has been nearly alone in his willingness to regularly support Trump nominees  including the Supreme Court justices Brett M  Kavanaugh and Neil M  Gorsuch Image A vote for Readler is very simply a vote for the lawsuit to strike down our health care law   said Senator Chuck Schumer of the nominee CreditSarah Silbiger The New York Times This is something I don t do often   Mr  Manchin said   I don t take it lightly   But Mr  Readler  he said  had  single handedly tried to rip insurance away from West Virginians and Americans  when his Justice Department responsibility was just the opposite  This gentleman has basically shown it is not about the law  it is not about the Constitution  it is about his politics and himself and not a man who should be sitting on a higher court   Mr  Manchin said Republicans said little in support of Mr  Readler  nor did any of them back his position in the health care case Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  who has made confirming judicial nominees a top priority  said that Mr  Readler  46  had  built a longstanding reputation in private practice as a consummate legal professional  He was the second appellate judge to be confirmed this week after a Senate vote on Tuesday on the nomination of Allison Rushing  36  a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas  to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  Republicans dismissed concerns about her lack of experience  and Ms  Rushing will be the youngest federal judge in the nation After Mr  Readler s confirmation vote  Mr  McConnell immediately moved to force a final vote on another nominee  Eric E  Murphy  40  the state solicitor for Ohio  to fill another vacancy on the Sixth Circuit  Democrats and liberal activists oppose him  saying he fought against the legalization of same sex marriage and supported efforts to make it harder to vote The fate of another high profile nominee   Neomi Rao for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit   remains uncertain  though Republican objections that threatened her confirmation have quieted Republicans have the power to confirm Mr  Trump s judicial nominees with a simple majority because of a successful attempt by a Democratic led Senate in 2013 to overturn a longstanding rule requiring 60 votes to confirm a judge  But the process can still be time consuming  Mr  McConnell has grown increasingly impatient and frustrated with Democrats for stretching out the time to consider nominees Republicans are now threatening to use their majority to push through a change that would cut debate time on most nominees to two hours from 30 hours after an initial procedural vote  The change would not apply to appeals court judges like Mr  Readler  but it would allow the Senate to clear a backlog of lower level district court nominees much faster Mr  McConnell said again Tuesday that he would like to reach an agreement on the change with Democrats but that appears highly unlikely  We re still hoping to have bipartisan support to go forward with the standing order  which would require 60 votes   Mr  McConnell said   In the absence of that  it is still my desire to try to achieve that  and that s an issue we ll have  a discussion we ll have among Republicans  Without a compromise  Republican senators said they expected to force the rules showdown by the end of the month 
Any week now  any day now   so the news reports go   the special counsel s office will file the Mueller report It will round out a trilogy  In 1974  to inform its impeachment proceedings  Congress received what became known as the  road map   a terse document from the office of the Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski detailing evidence of wrongdoing by President Richard Nixon  In 1998  another investigator submitted a report on a president s potentially impeachable offenses to Congress  a narrative from the independent counsel Kenneth Starr of Bill Clinton s misconduct Following Justice Department regulations  the special counsel Robert Mueller will submit a  confidential report  to the attorney general  Bill Barr  Mr  Barr will decide how much of it to share with Congress and with the world at large Assuming that some significant portion of the report becomes public  and that it provides an additional factual record beyond what we already know  the question will quickly become how to identify any smoking guns  I ve spent the last year and a half following the investigation  Here s a partial list of what I ll be looking for The  Moscow Project  In November 2015  according to Mr  Mueller  Michael Cohen  then Mr  Trump s lawyer  was put in touch with a Russian man who promised Mr  Cohen  political synergy  and  repeatedly proposed a meeting  between Mr  Trump and the Russian president  Vladimir Putin  to help with efforts to construct a Trump Tower Moscow  In January 2016  the office of a  high level Russian official    most likely  according to reports  of Mr  Putin s spokesman Dmitri Peskov   reached out to Mr  Cohen about the project  and efforts on it continued at least into the summer of 2016 How closely were Mr  Trump and his children involved in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations  and over what period  How much did they know of or encourage Mr  Cohen s contacts with the Russian government   including tentative plans for a meeting between Mr  Trump and Mr  Putin  How did the Trump family and campaign understand the connection between the  Moscow project  and Mr  Trump s political ambitions Mr  Mueller estimated in a court filing that Trump Tower Moscow could have generated  hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues    an unusually large profit for the Trump Organization  Why was the number so atypically high   Dirt  on ClintonIn spring 2016  according to the special counsel  a professor linked to the Russian government told the Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that Russia had  dirt  on Hillary Clinton in the form of  thousands of emails   Around this time  the special counsel s indictment of Russian military intelligence officials shows that the Russian government had hacked into networks and accounts belonging to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign  and would soon begin coordinating with WikiLeaks to disseminate the stolen information  In June  Donald Trump Jr  met with a Kremlin linked lawyer at Trump Tower in New York in what seems to have been a failed effort to get similar  dirt  Who else in the campaign did Mr  Papadopoulos tell about his scoop  and how high did that knowledge go  Did Donald Trump Jr  inform his father of his plans before the meeting  Roger Stone and WikiLeaksMr  Mueller s indictment of the Trump adviser Roger Stone alleges that Mr  Stone worked throughout the summer of 2016 to get in touch with WikiLeaks and became aware of the organization s plans to disclose hacked information  Mr  Cohen claimed in his testimony to Congress that he was in the room when Mr  Stone informed Mr  Trump that WikiLeaks was planning a  massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton s campaign  Was Mr  Stone coordinating with the campaign in his efforts to get information from WikiLeaks  How much did Mr  Trump know about what Mr  Stone had found out  And who in the campaign  if anyone  might have been aware of separate efforts by the Republican operative Peter Smith to obtain additional Clinton emails from sources Mr  Smith believed were Russian hackers Flynn s Promises to Moscow The national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired just 24 days into his tenure over fallout from his transition period contacts with the Russian ambassador at the time  Sergey Kislyak   a matter about which he later pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators  When he promised Mr  Kislyak that Mr  Trump would lift sanctions on Russia imposed by the departing Obama administration  was Mr  Flynn freelancing or was he acting on the instructions of someone higher Russian Influence Operations Almost every case that Mr  Mueller has filed has illuminated a different facet of what appears to be a systematic  long running effort by the government of Russia to reach out to Mr  Trump s world  It s clear that the Kremlin was attempting to gain access and influence  Was it also out and out working to recruit agents within the Trump Organization and campaign On our side of the Atlantic  to what extent was that outreach welcomed and reciprocated by the Trump team  and to what extent was Mr  Trump a passive beneficiary  Did the Trump Organization and campaign understand and respond to those instances as manifestations of a systematic effort by the Russian government or as unrelated connections with unconnected Russians Obstruction of JusticeMr  Mueller has also reportedly conducted an investigation into potential obstruction of justice by the president  possible interference with the special counsel s efforts  and with the F B I  s before that  Mr  Barr  among others  has argued that action authorized by the Constitution   like dismissing the F B I  director   by definition cannot constitute obstruction  Will the report sidestep these tricky legal questions by showing efforts by Mr  Trump to derail the inquiry that fall plainly outside the scope of presidential authority  To what extent does the obstruction investigation overlap with the collusion investigation   meaning that the special counsel and the F B I  understood the president s apparent efforts at obstruction as part of the troubling pattern of coordination with the Russian government that incited the investigation in the first place What proportion of the Mueller report becomes public will hinge on many factors  how much classified information and grand jury material shielded from public disclosure it has  how much of it is arguably protected by executive privilege  to what extent it details criminal conduct  and to what extent Mr  Barr may reasonably argue that the Justice Department has an interest in protecting the privacy of those who are innocent The Watergate  road map  first became available to the public in 2018  when a judge ordered it unsealed almost 45 years after it was handed over to Congress  The Starr Report  in contrast  was released within two days of its transmission to the legislature  With any luck  the time frame for release of the Mueller report will be closer to the latter than to the former RelatedAnticipating the Mueller reportOpinion   Neal K  KatyalThe

Republicans hate deficits  Or at least that s what they claim Republicans in Congress spent the entire Obama administration inveighing against budget deficits  warning incessantly that we were going to have a Greek style fiscal crisis any day now  Donald Trump  on the other hand  focused his ire mainly on trade deficits  insisting that  our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us  But over two years of unified G O P  control of government  a funny thing happened  Both deficits surged  The budget deficit has hit a level unprecedented except during wars and in the immediate aftermath of major economic crises  the trade deficit in goods has set a record What s the significance of this tide of red ink Let s be clear  Neither the budget deficit nor the trade deficit poses a clear and present danger to the U S  economy  Advanced countries that borrow in their own currencies can and often do run up large debts without drastic consequences   which is why the debt panic of a few years ago was always nonsense Yet Trump s twin deficits tell us a lot about both the tweeter in chief and his party   namely  that they re both dishonest and ignorant  Paul Krugman did explanatory journalism before it was cool  moving from a career as a world class economist to writing hard hitting opinion columns  For an even deeper look at what s on his mind  sign up for his weekly newsletter  About the dishonesty  Is there anyone left who believes that Republicans ever really cared about debt and deficits  The truth is that the phoniness of their fiscal posturing should have been obvious all along In any case  at this point it s undeniable that their fire and brimstone debt rhetoric was nothing but a pose  an attempt to weaponize the deficit as a way to block and undermine President Barack Obama s agenda  The moment they had a chance  the very politicians who grandstanded about the need for fiscal responsibility rammed through a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy   a tax cut that is the main reason for the exploding budget deficit Oh  and the tax cut has utterly failed to deliver the promised investment boom  Companies didn t use their giant windfall to build new plants and raise productivity  they used it to buy back a lot of stock  passing the gains on to wealthy investors What about the ignorance  As many people have pointed out to no avail  Trump is all wrong about what trade deficits do  True  at times of high unemployment deficits can cost us jobs  But in normal times they don t reduce overall employment  nor do they make us poorer  On the contrary  other countries are sending us valuable goods and services  which we re paying for with pieces of paper   paper that pays very low interest rates  Who s winning  again Beyond that  however  Trump is completely wrong about what causes trade deficits in the first place  In fact  his own policies have provided an object lesson in the falsity of his vision In the Trumpian universe  trade deficits happen because we made bad deals   we let foreigners sell their stuff here  but they won t let us sell our stuff there  So the solution is to throw up barriers to foreign products   I am a Tariff Man   he proudly proclaimed The reality  however  is that trade deficits have almost nothing to do with tariffs or other restrictions on trade  The overall trade deficit is always equal to the difference between domestic investment spending and domestic saving  both private and public   That s just accounting  The reason America runs persistent trade deficits isn t that we ve given away too much in trade deals  it s that we have low savings compared with other countries Tariffs can  of course  reduce imports of the goods subject to the tariff  and hence reduce the trade deficit in that particular industry  But it s like pushing on a balloon  You can squeeze it in one place  but it will just inflate by the same amount somewhere else  The process through which this conservation of deficits takes place can vary  although a stronger dollar  which hurts exports  is usually one major channel  But the basic result  that tariffs don t actually reduce the overall trade deficit  is clear Sure enough  the Trump tariffs of 2018 did  in fact  lead to a sharp fall in imports of the goods subjected to tariffs  But imports of other goods rose  while exports performed poorly  And the overall trade deficit went up substantially  which is exactly what you should have expected  After all  that big tax cut for the wealthy reduced national savings And the supposed cause of the deficit isn t the only thing Trump gets wrong about trade policy  He also keeps insisting that foreigners are paying his tariffs  In reality  prices received by foreign exporters haven t gone down  Prices paid by U S  consumers have gone up  instead Again  the swelling trade deficit doesn t pose any immediate threat to the U S  economy  And even the Trumpian trade war has probably done only limited economic harm  the main damage is to U S  credibility But Trump s twin deficits show that his party has been lying about its policy priorities  and that he is completely clueless about his signature policy issue  Luckily  a great nation like America can survive a lot  including dishonesty and ignorance at the top The Times is committed to publishing a

WASHINGTON   Mahmoud Abbas  the Palestinian leader  greeted President Trump in February 2017 with a portrait of the American president on mother of pearl panels  framed in white floral foliate An official from Saudi Arabia presented Mr  Trump with a framed assemblage of 12 goldtone items in miniature relating to the kingdom  surrounding a sepia toned photograph of the president  appraised by the State Department at  790 The prime minister of Vietnam gave the president a  gemstone painting  of Mr  Trump smiling against a backdrop of an American flag  made of stone granules  worth about  1 880 Flattery was a major theme of the gifts that Mr  Trump received from foreign officials in the first year of his presidency  based on the list published Thursday in the Federal Register  But that does not make the current president unique Emerald studded  gold plated gift giving has long been part of international diplomacy  with gifts from foreign officials often tailored to the publicly known interests of the man sitting in the Oval Office  Vaclav Havel  the former president of the Czech Republic  gave President Bill Clinton a goldtone saxophone with mother of pearl keys engraved with his signature  in honor of the instrument Mr  Clinton used to play  Heartbreak Hotel  on a TV talk show when he was a candidate for president President Barack Obama  who during his 2008 campaign drew parallels between himself and President Abraham Lincoln  another son of Illinois  was given multiple busts of Mr  Lincoln by foreign leaders  according to Federal Register records  Trying to find appropriate gifts to give to the president is always kind of a test of ingenuity of the donor   said Gerald M  Feierstein  who served as ambassador to Yemen under Mr  Obama   The intent of the gifts is to flatter  and to put the relationship on the best footing  In the Trump administration  a common theme appears to be lavish portraits and paraphernalia depicting the commander in chief  a man known to be concerned with his own self image President Andrzej Duda of Poland  for instance  gave Mr  Trump a burgundy album containing 10 photographs titled   President Donald J  Trump in New York   a collection that included black and white photographs of Mr  Trump in his real estate developer days  as well as polychrome photographs of Trump Tower in Manhattan Foreign officials also appear to have studied the family members who serve as Mr  Trump s inner circle of White House advisers  the gift list shows Jared Kushner  the president s son in law and senior adviser  for instance  was given a book   The Jews of Singapore  by Joan Bieder  from Singapore s minister of foreign affairs  Mr  Kushner is a practicing Orthodox Jew A gift to Melania Trump  the first lady  from President Xi Jinping of China and his wife  Peng Liyuan  features an 85 piece porcelain dinnerware set  The set includes plates displaying hand applied printed images of the pink house at Mar a Lago  the president s Palm Beach  Fla   club where Mr  Trump hosted Mr  Xi for a summit meeting  The estimated value of the gift was  16 250 Satsuki Katayama  a Japanese politician in the House of Councillors  the upper house of Parliament  gave Ivanka Trump  the president s eldest daughter and a senior White House aide  a golf club engraved with an American flag and her name   Ivanka Marie Trump   Ms  Trump famously told Wendy Williams  an American TV host  in 2013 that her common interests with her father included real estate and golf The first lady and Ms  Trump  both known for their interest fashion  each received multiple designer handbags  And in 2017  King Abdullah II of Jordan presented the Trump grandchildren with a cigar box worth about  540 The most expensive gift given exclusively to Mr  Trump in 2017 was a  14 400 paper panel displaying five columns of black calligraphy  given to him by Mr  Xi in April 2017 When it comes to reciprocating  the United States is known to be  very chintzy   Mr  Feierstein said  While foreign governments regularly give bejeweled  hand painted gifts worth tens of thousands of dollars   we used to give glass eagles and things that are not nearly equivalent to what we get   he said In 2009  for instance  after Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain gave Mr  Obama a pen holder carved from the timber of an antislave ship  he received in return a box set of American movies on DVD  setting of a cycle of critical coverage in the British news media Gifts to the president are automatically turned over to the State Department  But presidents or their families are allowed to keep gifts if they purchase them from the government for the appraised value  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  would not say on Thursday whether Mr  Trump or any of his family members had purchased any of the gifts Some of the gifts appeared farcical  Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium gave Mr  Trump a framed cartoon that depicted a cowboy eating out of a frying pan  while Indians approach from behind 
American diplomacy is dangerously adrift  It s tempting to simply blame President Trump  His erratic leadership and narcissistic brand of diplomacy were on full display at the Hanoi summit with Kim Jong un of North Korea  Untethered to the judgments of his intelligence community  dismissive of careful preparation and transfixed by his powers of persuasion  the president gave Mr  Kim an unearned boost in stature and came home empty handed But the roots of America s diplomatic decay run deeper  and a cure will involve more than just seeing the back of Donald Trump For 33 years  under five presidents and 10 secretaries of state  I played a modest role in the wider drama of American foreign policy and its occasional diplomatic triumphs  Those peaks  however  overshadowed debilitating trends Our dominance in a more benign post Cold War environment lulled us into complacency  The shock of Sept  11 led us to rely even more on the American military as our tool of first resort  with diplomacy an afterthought with fewer and fewer resources We didn t make it any easier for ourselves at the State Department  We buried our agility and initiative with layer upon layer of bureaucracy  And as the costs of misadventures abroad became more obvious  a yawning gap emerged between a Washington establishment preaching the gospel of American indispensability and a skeptical American public President Trump channeled those frustrations and difficulties  fed them and made them infinitely worse  At precisely the time when diplomacy matters more than ever to American interests   when we are no longer the only country calling the shots   the president is engaged in unilateral diplomatic disarmament  hollowing out the idea of America  retreating from international commitments and disdaining the institutions and practitioners of diplomacy  Not surprisingly  adversaries are taking advantage  allies are hedging and the global order we did so much to shape and defend is teetering For all the damage we re doing to ourselves  it s not too late to shift course  We re no longer the singular dominant power that we were just after the Cold War  but we re still the pivotal player  We still have lots of assets  the world s best military  an economy that is bigger and more innovative than anyone else s  even though it is plagued by inequalities  and a capacity for alliances and coalition building unmatched by our rivals  We still have a window of American pre eminence before us  in which we can help shape international order to safeguard our interests and values  before others shape it for us What that requires is the revival of American diplomacy as our primary tool for navigating a more crowded  complicated and competitive world  That will not be easy  Diplomacy is among the oldest of professions  but also among the most misunderstood  It is by nature an unheroic  quiet endeavor  often unfolding in back channels out of sight and out of mind  Crises averted are less captivating than military victories  diplomacy s preventive care is less compelling than the military s surgical feats The Trump administration has made the formidable task of diplomatic renewal even harder and more urgent   embracing early on the biggest budget cuts in the modern history of the State Department  driving out many of its most capable senior and midlevel officers  cutting intake into the Foreign Service by more than half  leaving key ambassadorships and senior roles in Washington unfilled  reversing what was admittedly slow progress on gender and ethnic diversity  and blacklisting individual officers simply because they worked on controversial issues in the previous administration There is no neat alchemy to address President Trump s diplomatic malpractice  let alone decades of drift  but there are at least three imperatives First  we have to recapture the fundamentals of diplomatic tradecraft  Diplomats have been overwhelmed by existential angst  trying desperately to prove they are more than just village watchmakers in a smartwatch world  Over the course of my career  information exploded in pace and volume  the near monopoly on power of states was steadily eroded by nonstate actors   from the benign  like the Gates Foundation  to the malign  like Al Qaeda  and the near monopoly on presence and insight that diplomats used to have in foreign capitals also shrank  But the core roles and qualities of good diplomacy are not fundamentally different today from what they were in earlier eras Diplomats are classic organizers  harnessing all the levers of American influence  investing in alliances  mobilizing coalitions  endlessly adapting institutions and managing the gray area between peace and war  Even as the landscape shifts  the fundamentals   a nuanced grasp of history  mastery of foreign languages and facility in negotiations   remain indispensable Second  we urgently need to build modern capabilities on top of that traditional foundation  Recent efforts at transformation have tended to focus on the capillaries of institutional change  rather than the arteries  more on how we look than how we work  We need to strip down the State Department s bureaucracy and make it more nimble  We ought to invest heavily in 21st century skill sets so that we can better compete in the new global economy  cope with global challenges like climate change and maximize the benefits of the revolution in technology while minimizing its disruptions Third  we have to construct a new domestic compact between government and citizens about America s role in the world  and the utility of diplomacy in this new era  As we near the end of the second decade of a military campaign in Afghanistan and continue to wrestle with the consequences of the war in Iraq  Americans are naturally exasperated about the costs in blood and treasure  and the indiscipline that all too often belies our rhetoric about disciplined leadership  We have to demonstrate that diplomacy and international influence are aimed as much at enabling domestic renewal as they are at shoring up global order  We need to show that smart foreign policy not only begins at home  in the strength of our political and economic system  but ends there too   in better jobs  more prosperity  a healthier climate and greater security Getting beyond the age of Trump is a necessary  but not sufficient  condition for diplomacy s revival  We have to learn the lessons of not only Mr  Trump s demolition of diplomacy but also our frequent inattention to its significance over the past quarter century  Diplomacy at its best rarely swaggers  It s about quiet power  But if we re not louder about one of our nation s biggest assets and best kept secrets  we risk losing it

Bill Shine  the former Fox News executive who joined the White House staff last summer to manage President Trump s communications operation  has resigned and will move to the president s re election campaign  the White House announced Friday Mr  Shine s abrupt departure came as a surprise to many in the White House and was revealed  as such personnel moves often are in this administration  as the president was on Air Force One leaving Washington While described by admiring White House colleagues as a rare adult in the room  Mr  Shine has sometimes been absent during key moments  including the president s trip last week to Vietnam  Colleagues said he had developed little chemistry with Mr  Trump  and critics increasingly focused on Mr  Shine s ties to Fox  where he was forced out for his handling of sexual harassment claims In a meeting late Friday morning with communications staff members  Mr  Shine told colleagues that he was leaving for two reasons  according to a person familiar with what took place  He said that he lived a solitary existence in Washington and missed his family  who remained in New York  But the second reason  he said  was that he had become a distraction for Mr  Trump and did not see that changing The White House sought to present Mr  Shine s resignation as amicable and issued statements in the name of the president and other officials praising him  But people close to the White House described the campaign job as a way to save face  Bill Shine has done an outstanding job working for me and the administration   Mr  Trump said in his statement   We will miss him in the White House  but look forward to working together on the 2020 presidential campaign  where he will be totally involved  Thank you to Bill and his wonderful family  In the same statement  Mr  Shine was quoted calling his time in the White House an honor and  the most rewarding experience  of his life   I m looking forward to working on President Trump s re election campaign and spending more time with my family   he said Mr  Shine  who held the title of deputy White House chief of staff  was the sixth person to accept the job to manage communications for the Trump White House  a position that has been problematic given that Mr  Trump prefers to be his own chief spokesman and rarely sticks to a messaging plan that aides seek to establish  The White House gave no indication who will replace Mr  Shine Mr  Shine s presence in the White House was seen as emblematic of how closely Mr  Trump has aligned himself with Fox  a symbiotic relationship that drew a critical appraisal in a much read New Yorker article published this week  Mr  Trump has given the network about 45 interviews as president  using it to communicate with his most fervent supporters even as he embraces lines of argument that its hosts advance Mr  Trump regularly posts messages on Twitter reacting to reports he sees on Fox and has been said to privately talk on the phone with Sean Hannity  the network s marquee star  many nights after Mr  Hannity s show The line between the White House and Fox grew even blurrier last fall when Mr  Trump invited Mr  Hannity and another host  Jeanine Pirro  to join him onstage for a campaign rally  after which Mr  Shine and Mr  Hannity were seen sharing a high five  The president routinely praises Fox hosts from the podium during speeches  and according to The New Yorker article  he has privately rated Fox hosts on a scale of 1 to 10 based on their loyalty to him   Mr  Hannity got a 10  The Turnover at the Top of the Trump Administration Is UnprecedentedSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other Mr  Shine  who is personally close with Mr  Hannity  came into the White House with great fanfare last year  Initially  people there   particularly those close to John F  Kelly  then the White House chief of staff   described Mr  Shine favorably  saying he brought a mature presence to the team and  unusual for the White House  did not seem interested in seeking credit for himself But as time wore on  it became clearer that Mr  Shine had not developed a close relationship with Mr  Trump  The president frequently complained to other advisers that his news coverage had not improved  according to several people familiar with Mr  Trump s comments  And he was seen as ineffective  with few new ideas Mr  Shine attached himself to Ivanka Trump  the president s eldest daughter  and tried to help out with her media coverage  But an ABC News interview that she did included a question about how she and her husband  Jared Kushner  obtained their security clearances  which multiple White House officials said rankled her Mr  Trump s troubles recruiting and retaining communications chiefs have been striking even in a White House with the highest staff turnover in decades  Mr  Trump first gave the job after his election to a top campaign aide  Jason Miller  who backed out two days later after a campaign colleague disclosed on social media that he had impregnated her during an extramarital affair Sean Spicer  the White House press secretary  then held the position as a second job until Mr  Trump hired Michael Dubke  a longtime Republican operative  Mr  Dubke resigned after a few months  leaving Mr  Spicer to fill in again The most spectacular flameout came when Anthony Scaramucci  a brash and outspoken New York financier  was fired after just 11 days as communications director following a verbal tirade to a New Yorker reporter about other White House officials Putting aside her own reservations  Hope Hicks  one of Mr  Trump s most trusted aides  then took the job and held it until stepping down a year ago  the only person who was seen as successful at channeling the volatile president and maintaining the respect of her colleagues Mr  Shine had spent more than a year searching for another job after he was ousted from Fox amid the scandal surrounding Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly and the accusations of sexual harassment that were made against them  Mr  Shine was not himself accused of improper behavior  but was faulted for a culture that sought to cover it up  The White House became his road to redemption But Mr  Shine had increasingly been out of sight during key moments  including when the government shutdown began at the end of December  His wife  Darla  never relocated to Washington  and he was open about finding the travel away from her difficult As the president tweeted about legislators leaving town at the end of the year  Mr  Shine was in Hawaii on a vacation with his wife  More recently  after telling people he was traveling to Vietnam for the president s summit meeting with North Korea s leader  Kim Jong un  last week  Mr  Shine ended up staying behind As recently as two weeks ago  Mr  Shine was privately sharing his plans to revamp the White House communications shop with his allies in the administration  He said he wanted to  professionalize  a press team whose approach has often seemed ad hoc  according to a senior administration official who  like others  spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal dynamics  Mr  Shine also discussed streamlining the process to put more Trump surrogates on television Although he failed to build enduring ties with the president  Mr  Shine was well liked in the administration  in part because he would often bear the brunt of the president s criticism without trying to pass the blame on to others  a senior administration official said  Mr  Shine had also won the support of Mr  Trump s children  including Ms  Trump 
OAKLAND  Calif    Nearly nine months after the Trump administration officially rescinded its policy of separating migrant families who have illegally crossed the border  more than 200 migrant children have been taken from parents and other relatives and placed in institutional care  with some spending months in shelters and foster homes thousands of miles away from their parents The latest data reported to the federal judge monitoring one of the most controversial of President Trump s immigration policies shows that 245 children have been removed from their families since the court ordered the government to halt routine separations under last spring s  zero tolerance  border enforcement policy  Some of the new separations are being undertaken with no clear documentation to help track the children s whereabouts Images of crying mothers and children at the border last year prompted an intense backlash across party lines  with all four living former first ladies and Melania Trump expressing horror at the policy  But despite President Trump s June 20 executive order rescinding it  the practice was never completely suspended Under the original policy  most children were removed because parents who illegally crossed the border were subject to criminal prosecution  The recent separations have occurred largely because parents have been flagged for fraud  a communicable disease or past criminal history   in some cases relatively minor violations  years in the past  that ordinarily would not lead to the loss of parental custody  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border   a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  The new separations are taking place amid an unprecedented influx of migrant families from across the southern border that has highlighted the failure of the Trump administration s hard line policies to deter them  The Border Patrol detained 76 103 migrants in February  an 11 year high for that month  Among those intercepted were about 40 000 members of families  two thirds more than in January In Congress last week  Democrats grilled Kirstjen Nielsen  the Homeland Security secretary  over the separation policy  citing research that has found that separations from parents can inflict long term psychological harm on children Family separations also sometimes occurred under the Obama administration  but only rarely and in extreme cases in which a child s safety appeared to be at risk Customs and Border Protection officials say the separations are legal under the parameters set by the court and are intended to protect children  who they say may be threatened by human trafficking or by adults pretending to be a parent to capitalize on the advantage that gives them under American immigration laws  C B P  does not declare that a parent poses danger to a child arbitrarily or without merit   the agency said in a statement  It said agents  will maintain family unity to the greatest extent operationally feasible   separating children only in the presence of  a legal requirement  set out in written policy or  an articulable safety or security concern that requires separation  But opposition to the new separations has been growing from both outside and inside the federal government  At the Health and Human Services Department s Office of Refugee Resettlement  which oversees the care of separated children until they can be reunited with their families  some officials have tried to resist receiving children referred to the agency by the Border Patrol According to an official who was not authorized to discuss government business and spoke on the condition of anonymity  staff members have in some cases raised questions with Border Patrol agents about separations with what appear to be little or no justification  In some of those cases  border agents have refused to provide additional information  the official said  or if additional documents were provided  they were sometimes redacted to the point of illegibility The official  along with another staff member at the Department of Homeland Security  the Border Patrol s parent agency  said that some separations were occurring with no formal notification to the refugee resettlement office  Both officials said they had been made aware of concerns about an apparent inconsistency in standards applied by border agents when determining whether a family should be separated The failure to keep accurate records suggests that more children could have been separated than the 245 accounted for by Feb  20 in official records The New York Times reviewed several cases of children who have been separated since the policy was officially ended  and learned of many others through the lawyers who handled them  Some of the new separations  the review showed  occurred in families with a parent who had a drunken driving conviction in the past  or a 20 year old nonviolent robbery conviction  In one case  a parent had been convicted of possession of a small amount of marijuana Donna Abbott  vice president for refugee and immigrant services at Bethany Christian Services  a contractor that accommodates migrant children in temporary foster homes until they can be reunited with family members  said most cases of family separations do not list detailed reasons  making it difficult to evaluate whether they were appropriate For example  some files state only that the parent was suspected of having gang affiliations or a criminal history  without additional information   Is it trespassing or is it murder   Ms  Abbott said In December  a mother traveling from El Salvador with her three children was arrested and put on a bus to an immigration detention facility in Arizona while her children  ages 5  8 and 15  were sent to foster care in New York The woman  Deisy Ramirez  38  said it was nearly six weeks before she talked to her children They were  devastated   said Ms  Ramirez s sister  Silvia Ramirez  who was trying to persuade the government to allow her to take the children to live with her in Seattle while her sister was in custody   They couldn t understand why they were separated   she said On March 1  Ms  Ramirez s eldest daughter was transferred to a hospital after threatening to take her own life  Silvia Ramirez said  and she remained there even after her mother s release from detention last week  I never imagined this could happen   Deisy Ramirez said on Friday  her voice breaking   All I want is to hold my children and to be with them  Her lawyer  Ricardo de Anda  said he had received no response to his formal request for a reason for the separation  He suspects it may be connected to the fact that Ms  Ramirez had been deported from the United States more than a decade ago  He sent government lawyers a series of emails  ultimately securing her release On Saturday  the day after her release from the Arizona detention facility  Ms  Ramirez was preparing to fly to New York to reunite with her children Border agents removed 3 year old Ashley Ramos from her father after they were detained last month in Arizona  He was swiftly deported to Guatemala and the girl was sent to a shelter The child s mother  Silvia Maribel Ramos  who had been separated from the pair during their journey from Guatemala when Mexican police pulled her and other migrants off their bus for questioning  arrived in Arizona a few days later  only to learn from authorities that her child was gone  They told me they had no idea where she was  that I would find out after being released   said Ms  Ramos  who is staying with relatives in Oakland  Calif The child was located nearly two weeks later  she said  after her husband contacted Guatemalan authorities back home  Now Ms  Ramos is struggling with the paperwork required to recover Ashley   My daughter can t understand  She just weeps and begs to be with us   she said In late January  Victor Antonio Marin was separated from his 4 year old son  whose mother is deceased  after they were detained near Calexico  Calif  According to his lawyer  Bob Boyce  Mr  Marin had a 20 year old nonviolent robbery conviction in the United States that did not involve the use of a weapon  He served time and was deported back to El Salvador Now Mr  Marin remains locked up in an immigration detention center while his child is in a shelter in Texas Ruben Garcia  who runs a network of migrant shelters in El Paso  said that immigration authorities this month dropped off a distraught 18 year old woman from Guatemala The woman said she had given birth less than a week earlier and had been separated from her baby  Child welfare authorities had come to the hospital to take the child  who was a United States citizen  immigration agents took the mother back to a detention cell where she waited for several days  The baby s first two weeks were spent away from the mother  who finally regained custody after interventions from multiple legal aid groups  Mr  Garcia said Since Mr  Trump ended the family separations under  zero tolerance  on June 20  about 2 700 children have been reunited with their parents  Still  thousands more children who were separated before the policy officially went into effect have not been accounted for  according to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services  The investigators cited the lack of an efficient tracking system The American Civil Liberties Union requested that the government locate the families  and on Friday  Judge Dana M  Sabraw ruled that they should be included in the pending litigation over protecting and reuniting separated families  The hallmark of a civilized society is measured by how it treats its people and those within its borders   the judge wrote in his opinion Some families affected by the earlier zero tolerance separations continue to face repercussions A 9 year old Guatemalan boy named Byron Xol has been shuffled among four shelters since he was dragged away from his father at the border nine months ago  while the policy was still in place After his father was deported to Guatemala  the boy s parents decided that the child should remain in the United States for safety reasons  With the help of a lawyer  they designated an American family in Buda  Tex   to care for him But authorities have refused to allow Byron to join the family  citing an anti trafficking policy that bars a child from being released to a nonrelative sponsor unless the sponsor has a verifiable relationship with the child going back at least a year Detentions and deportation proceedings have also resulted in family separations far from the border Christy Swatzell  an immigration lawyer in Memphis  said that two of her clients who crossed the border without authorization and were released to await the outcome of their cases were told by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to leave their children at home ahead of their monthly check in with the agency  When they showed up at the I C E  office  they were detained and transferred to an immigration facility in Louisiana One of the clients  Francisca Yanes  33  is the mother of a 6 year old girl who is physically disabled   I was in tears  telling them about my daughter  But it didn t matter   said Ms  Yanes  whose child  Paola  remained in the care of family members for the entire 45 days she was in detention The Guatemalan migrant was released on a  7 500 bond set by the court after her lawyer filed a motion on her behalf   What we are seeing is that families are being effectively separated   said Ms  Swatzell   Just not at the border anymore  
WASHINGTON   The Trump administration said Thursday that it had revoked 77 more visas of individuals aligned with President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela in its rolling campaign against a leader who has thwarted humanitarian aid deliveries and aggressive American led efforts to install his replacement  In all  more than 250 visas have been revoked   Kimberly Breier  an assistant secretary of state  wrote on Twitter  confirming what Vice President Mike Pence had hinted at this week   We will continue to hold all of the Maduro regime accountable until democracy   freedom are fully restored in  Venezuela  The visa announcement is the latest in a series of relatively modest moves by Washington intended to slowly choke off Mr  Maduro s economic resources So far  the Trump administration has introduced weekly rounds of sanctions against individuals  including Venezuelan governors and members of Mr  Maduro s inner circle  who are accused of helping deflect foreign aid from entering the country  Venezuela is suffering from skyrocketing poverty  hyperinflation and an exodus of millions under Mr  Maduro s government On Thursday  Elliott Abrams  the administration s top envoy to Venezuela  also told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that officials were considering granting temporary protected status to roughly 74 000 Venezuelans seeking to enter the United States  We have this policy under review right now   Mr  Abrams said Just days earlier  however  the possibility of granting such entry to Venezuelans seeking political asylum in the United States was played down by John R  Bolton  the president s national security adviser  He believes toppling Mr  Maduro s government and installing Juan Guaidó  the Venezuelan opposition leader  will negate the need for asylum Trump administration officials plan to build on sanctions levied against Petróleos de Venezuela  S A   or Pdvsa  the state run oil company  as a next step that could prove politically fatal for Mr  Maduro And one senior administration official  who was not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy  said this week that more efforts were on the way to target Mr  Maduro s cash reserves  including stronger sanctions against banking institutions and networks that work with his government Despite the aggressive campaign by the United States  Mr  Maduro has shown few signs of leaving power  He also appeared relatively unfazed after a violent scuffle over humanitarian aid unfolded at the Colombia border two weeks ago In recent days  Mr  Maduro s government has taken steps to clamp down on journalists  On Wednesday  an American freelance journalist with Venezuelan residency rights was arrested and deported Mr  Guaidó  who returned this week to Venezuela without incident after a tour through Latin America to shore up support  has called for more street protests of Mr  Maduro this weekend amid continued attempts to deliver aid Mr  Maduro  for his part  has accused Mr  Guaidó of being a puppet for the Trump administration Facing a stubborn Maduro government  members of the Trump administration have hinted at military intervention  a path requested by Mr  Guaidó  The opposition leader has garnered the support of more than 50 countries to take over as Venezuela s interim president On Wednesday evening  Mr  Bolton said again on Twitter that President Trump was considering  all options    the latest assurance to Mr  Guaidó that military intervention could be a possibility  albeit a distant one But other administration officials have signaled that they will try to wait out Mr  Maduro  no matter how long that might take  There is no timeline   Mr  Pence told the Spanish channel Univision in an interview on Wednesday   Interim President Guaidó has assumed authority under their Constitution  but our focus is on seeing a restoration of the rule of law and democracy in Venezuela  
In his testimony before Congress last week  Michael Cohen in effect warned of a coup  Given my experience working for Mr  Trump  I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power   Cohen said That fit neatly into the concern in some liberal circles that President Trump may not simply undermine democracy but actually overturn it  References to the Nazi takeover of Germany have proliferated  and cautionary tales about fascism are now ubiquitous  including Madeleine Albright s  Fascism  A Warning  The polarization also leads Trump supporters to worry about a coup   by the  deep state  against Trump   and some make glib references about resorting to violence  We are in a civil war in this country   Joseph diGenova  a prominent conservative

just past the midpoint of the Trump presidency  I hope    it s worth examining how the country has weathered the challenge   and my take away is that American institutions and norms have shown impressive strength and resilience One of the most troubling elements of Trump s presidency has been his systematic assault on our institutions  the F B I   the Justice Department  the intelligence community  the news media  the courts  Yet for the most part  they have stood up to his bullying To take one example  Jane Mayer of The New Yorker reports that Trump in 2017 told aides to block a merger between AT T and Time Warner  apparently to punish CNN  a unit of Time Warner  for its news coverage while helping Fox News  This was utterly inappropriate  so aides ignored him  I ve mentioned it 50 times   Trump raged  according to Mayer s account   And nothing s happened  The Justice Department did in fact bring suit to block the merger  but courts foiled Trump and allowed it to go ahead Likewise  Trump s efforts to block meaningful investigations into his conduct have backfired  leading to the Robert Mueller inquiry and to congressional inquiries of obstruction of justice  His dangling of federal pardons before former associates encouraged state investigations  He has personally genuflected before Vladimir Putin  but his administration policy on Russia has ended up rather tougher  And his rogue behavior helped Democrats seize the House of Representatives Trump has regularly demonized journalists as  enemies of the people   but reporters have not been intimidated  As I ve often written  I thought we in the news media did not do well during the 2016 campaign  but the competition today between The Washington Post and The New York Times is the best kind of newspaper war  keeping America straight Gallup finds that public approval of newspapers  while still low  is up a little  since 2016 even as Trump has excoriated them The best book warning of authoritarianism

asked how they think the U S  has done so far in the Trump presidency  The U S  is not 1930s Germany or contemporary Hungary  Venezuela  or Turkey   Levitsky told me   The U S  has much stronger democratic institutions than these countries  and it has a much stronger opposition  So whereas in Hungary and Venezuela autocrats steamrolled weak oppositions  Trump faced pushback on multiple fronts  including  very importantly  the electoral front in November 2018  So  yes  U S  democracy is hard to kill  Still  Levitsky and Ziblatt caution that an underlying polarization and erosion of norms made Trump s election possible  and they persist  Moreover  while the Democratic victory in the House is good news for accountability  it also results in a divided government that can t get anything done  U S  democracy is sliding into dysfunction   Levitsky said  noting that this can increase the appeal of other demagogues  Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell have also refused to stand up to Trump and have allowed certain authoritarian values to infect a wing of the party  Almost a quarter of Republicans said in a poll last year that  President Trump should close down mainstream news

LOS ANGELES   Creating yet another roadblock to the Trump administration s efforts to deport ineligible migrants  a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that immigration authorities can no longer swiftly deport asylum seekers who fail an initial screening  opening the door for thousands of migrants a year to get another shot in the federal courts to win asylum in the United States The ruling broadens constitutional protections for undocumented immigrants at the border and opens a new legal gateway for some of them to appeal for permission to stay in the country  even when an asylum officer and an immigration judge have made a determination that they do not have a credible fear of persecution in their homeland  The historical and practical importance of this ruling cannot be overstated   said Lee Gelernt  deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union s Immigrants  Rights Project  who argued the appeal on behalf of a Sri Lankan migrant who had been turned away at California s border with Mexico in 2017  He said the ruling  reaffirms the Constitution s foundational principle that individuals deprived of their liberty must have access to a federal court  After dropping precipitously over five decades  the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border   the key indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the United States   is soaring again  driven by an influx of families from Central America fleeing violence and poverty  Immigration authorities received more than 99 000 requests for asylum interviews during the 2018 fiscal year  including more than 54 000 submitted at the southwest border  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border   a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  President Trump has said that migrants are exploiting the asylum system by making baseless and fraudulent claims in order to remain in the United States  and his administration has taken a number of steps to make the process harder  including narrowing the grounds for winning asylum  limiting the number of asylum seekers who can be processed at the border each day and requiring some applicants to wait in Mexico while their cases make their way through the courts In 2016  the most recent year for which data is available  an estimated 7 200 migrants were denied permission to apply for asylum after their initial interviews and were placed in expedited deportation proceedings  An analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that in June 2018  only 15 percent of initial asylum reviews found that the asylum seeker had a credible fear of persecution  about half the proportion that had prevailed a year earlier Thursday s court decision will most likely send that trend in the other direction  legal analysts said  This is a historic decision   said Stephen Yale Loehr  an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School   But the government will surely appeal this to the Supreme Court  The opinion  from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  extends constitutional habeas corpus guarantees to those applying for asylum at the border and provides that they can seek a hearing in the federal courts before being summarily deported   though the court did not specify what standards the courts must use to evaluate such petitions The ruling applies to asylum seekers in the nine western states included in the court s jurisdiction and  because it conflicts with an earlier ruling rejecting such legal protections in the Third Circuit  the issue is likely to be resolved ultimately by the Supreme Court  In the meantime  legal analysts said  the court s decision is likely to have sweeping implications for immigration deterrence efforts by enabling thousands to remain in the country while they seek the court review Under current procedure  every migrant who arrives at the border and expresses a fear of persecution in his or her homeland is referred for an interview with an asylum officer  Those who succeed in convincing the officer that they have a credible fear are allowed to enter the country and proceed with their asylum cases in the immigration courts  Those who don t can request a review by an immigration judge  but it is usually cursory and favorable decisions are rare  There is usually no access to a lawyer  and no opportunity to challenge the decision  deportation quickly ensues In the case before the appeals court  Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam  a member of Sri Lanka s Tamil ethnic minority  was arrested about 25 yards north of the border near San Ysidro  Calif   and told an asylum officer that he was fearful of returning to his homeland  The officer found no credible fear  and that finding was upheld by a supervisor and an immigration judge Mr  Thuraissigiam was in deportation proceedings when he filed a habeas corpus petition in the federal court  He argued that the asylum officer had failed to elicit important background about his case  including that he had been detained and beaten by Sri Lankan army officers on two occasions  and at one point had been lowered into a well and nearly drowned  He also said there were communication problems between the translator and both the asylum officer and the immigration judge As a result  his lawyers argued  he was deprived of  a meaningful right to apply for asylum  A district court judge in Los Angeles rejected that argument  but the three judge appeals court panel  sitting in San Francisco  held that even though an asylum seeker may lack the right to a full trial in immigration court  the Constitution requires a more complete review than what immigration law currently provides At its  historical core   said the 48 page opinion written by Judge A  Wallace Tashima   the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention  and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest  
 Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  DES MOINES   The sharp left turn in the Democratic Party and the rise of progressive presidential candidates are unnerving moderate Democrats who increasingly fear that the party could fritter away its chances of beating President Trump in 2020 by careening over a liberal cliff Two months into the presidential campaign  the leading Democratic contenders have largely broken with consensus driven politics and embraced leftist ideas on health care  taxes  the environment and Middle East policy that would fundamentally alter the economy  elements of foreign policy and ultimately remake American life Led by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  a democratic socialist who is the top candidate in the race at this early stage  many vocal leaders in the party are choosing to draw lessons from liberal victories in 2018 rather than the party s breakthroughs in moderate suburban battlegrounds that delivered Democratic control of the House These progressive Democrats risk playing into Mr  Trump s hands   he has repeatedly branded them  socialists    yet they argue that their ambitious agenda can inspire a voter revolt in 2020 that elects a left wing president  Those ideas that we talked about here in Iowa four years ago that seemed so radical at the time  remember that   Mr  Sanders  returning to Iowa this week for the first time as a 2020 candidate  crowed on Thursday   Shock of all shocks  those very same ideas are now supported not only by Democratic candidates for president but by Democratic candidates all across the board  from school board on up   Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  The sprint toward populism amounts to a rejection of the incremental and often defensive brand of politics that has characterized the party s approach to highly charged issues for 40 years  Yet when nearly half of voters indicate in polls that they will not support the president s re election  many moderates say the cautious strategy in 2018 that helped the party pick up 21 House seats that Mr  Trump carried two years earlier should be the playbook for next year  What we saw in the midterms is a lot of people from the center and moderate part of the party really win and take back the House   said Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire  alluding to the careful and poll tested campaigns many Democrats in Republican leaning districts ran last year   We need to make sure we re being as pragmatic as we can  This moderate wing of the party lacks an obvious standard bearer  Former Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg of New York  who would have run a centrist campaign  begged off this week  Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio  a Midwestern progressive who favors a within the system style of pragmatic politics  also decided not to run  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  who is running  has presented herself as a centrist but has not yet gained traction ImageSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has presented herself as a centrist but has not gained traction in the Democratic presidential race CreditElizabeth Frantz for The New York TimesShould former Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  enter the race  as his top advisers vow he soon will  he would have the best immediate shot at the moderate mantle   And if he does not run  Democrats like former Gov  Terry McAuliffe of Virginia or Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo of New York might try to seek that role  Mr  Biden s candidacy would immediately thrust a fundamental dispute to the center of the Democratic race  Do Americans simply pine for a pre Trump equilibrium  less chaos and more consensus  or do the yawning disparities of these times call out for a more transformational administration  Read more  A  beat Trump  fervor is producing big turnouts for 2020 Democrats  Mr  Sanders and other Democratic candidates  like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  are plainly wagering that voters want more than a return to normalcy  In 2016 Iowa helped begin the political revolution   Mr  Sanders recalled on Saturday at a rally in Des Moines  referring to his near victory in the state s caucuses that year   Now as we move to 2020 our job is to complete that revolution  The liberal candidates have dominated the policy debate in the race so far  Ms  Warren proposed on Friday that the government break up big tech giants like Amazon and Facebook  the latest  and perhaps boldest  proposal to come from her campaign  And Mr  Sanders s platform    Medicare for all   free college tuition and an aggressive plan to combat climate change   has grown in popularity  according to polls Speaking at the University of Iowa as part of his campaign swing  Mr  Sanders also took aim at  establishment Democrats  and won his loudest and most sustained applause by pledging to push through his universal health care bill Mr  Sanders and Ms  Warren  along with a new generation of high profile progressives like Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York  have emerged this winter as the clearest and most vocal arbiters of Democratic aspirations  if not the immediate congressional agenda They are  at least  hastening the tectonic shifts taking place in the party  It was no accident that House Democrats modified a resolution targeting Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota   for her controversial claim that pro Israel advocates carry an  allegiance  to a foreign country   after Ms  Ocasio Cortez  other lawmakers of color and the party s leading presidential hopefuls rebelled against singling out Ms  Omar  The episode marked a striking departure from the down the line support for Israel that has characterized the upper ranks of most Democratic primaries Relying on wealthy donors has also been standard fare  and unremarkably so  in past White House races  But Mr  Sanders elevated the issue of campaign finance in his 2016 race  and his jeremiads against the billionaire class have all but made super PACs verboten in this race  he and Ms  Warren are refusing to hold high dollar fund raisers Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts  who won her seat after defeating an incumbent Democrat last year  conceded that the first months of 2019 had inflicted  growing pains  on Democrats  but she argued it was merely a necessary side effect in the party s evolution  After we build that muscle  we re going to flex it   Ms  Pressley said Yet Mr  Biden  in speeches at home and abroad  has used much of the first part of this year pledging to restore the dignity he believes that the country has lost in the Trump years  promising a restoration rather than a revolution  And  as his supporters put it less subtly  his campaign would represent something else  Overwhelmingly  the primary electorate of the Democratic Party wants to win   Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said  He argued that Mr  Biden could  repair a lot of the ways in which our position in the world has been harmed  while offering a  hopeful  optimistic  positive  vision at home that would heal the divisions he said Mr  Trump has exacerbated To such moderate Democrats  the most instructive recent election is not that of Mr  Trump in 2016 but rather the 2018 midterms  when many of the Democrats who won in battleground House districts and governor s races were decidedly less confrontational than Mr  Sanders  The overwhelming majority of seats we picked up were by center left candidates representing more centrist type districts   said Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania  adding   There s still lots of folks on our side who are O K  with compromise  Other Democrats are even blunter  fretting that the party risks alienating the broad middle of the electorate at a moment Mr  Trump is making no attempt to appeal to such voters  You live for the day in politics when the other guy is conceding the majority of the country   said Larry Grisolano  a longtime Democratic strategist Yet for many Democrats   especially younger voters who have largely known only Mr  Trump and another once unlikely president for eight years before that   it is a hopelessly outdated notion that the party must be prudent about who it nominates and tread only within centrist confines on animating issues like climate change  racial justice and universal health care  These progressives have no more experience with a right of center  Reagan era framework than their parents did with the New Deal  We have had enough of the centrist  corporatist Democratic   the type of Democrat that my mom would have voted for back in the  90s   said Jake Peters  a 23 year old Iowan and Sanders volunteer who drove two hours to see him speak in Council Bluffs this week   We just don t have patience for the platitudes  And Mr  Trump has emboldened these young activists  heightening the urgency they feel about enacting a progressive agenda  and convincing them that Mr  Sanders s blunt force message about injustice is what s needed to defeat the president  Chris Kivlahan  22  who came to the Iowa City rally  described a Sanders presidency this way   I think if it s going to happen  now is the time and Trump is the candidate to be running against  Democrats in Washington are seeing the tensions within the party firsthand as they try to balance an agenda that their newly elected moderates can support while also mollifying more liberal newcomers who are eager to impeach Mr  Trump and pursue far reaching goals  such as the Green New Deal ImagePresidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mr  Sanders are plainly wagering that Democratic voters want more than a return to normalcy CreditElizabeth Frantz for The New York Times A lot of young people have come into a world where there was more diversity  more opportunities and where they had use of social media   said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland about the expectations of next generation activists and lawmakers  some of whom serve on the oversight committee he chairs   A guy like me  I had to fight to even get in the door  To tell some of these younger Democrats that a uncompromising progressive platform may be unattainable  let alone who can and cannot be elected president  is difficult given Mr  Trump s victory and the chasm they see between the scale of the problems they will confront and the policies in place today And unlike many in the party s pragmatic wing  these Democrats believe the recipe for success in the general election is not to nominate another seemingly safe candidate like Hillary Clinton  who was unable to galvanize the base and lost crucial votes to a Green Party nominee  but to put forward somebody who will energize reluctant voters  Obviously we ve shown that we re at a place where we re O K  with nontraditional candidates   said Riley Wilson  a 29 year old Nebraskan who crossed the Missouri River to see Mr  Sanders  He added   I think so many people just aren t involved at all in politics  and I think he would be able to bring some of those people into the fold because they ll feel like they have options that they haven t had before  politically speaking  And about the Republican strategy  led by Mr  Trump himself  to pin the  socialism  label on the Democrats in 2020 Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it was mostly just his party s elite  donor class  that had anything to fear from a sweeping  progressive agenda Well  them and the arbiters of conventional political wisdom  he added  What we ve learned from last two presidential elections is that nobody knows anything   Mr  Schatz said of the election of former President Barack Obama and Mr  Trump   The people who write op eds and stroke their chins and tell us how to win are the people who have been getting it wrong for almost two decades now  
SHREVEPORT  La    Transgender troops like Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher are seen as  an unreasonable burden  by the Trump administration  It says their presence hurts morale and the military s ability to fight  and that they have no place in uniform That s news to Airman Crutcher  He just got back from a deployment with his B 52 bomber squadron  and when he did  fellow airmen in his squadron  whom he counts among his best friends  threw a shower for him and his wife  Aimee  to celebrate their first child  born in February  Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty  conflict and consequence   At my level  it s not an issue   Airman Crutcher  30  said about serving while transgender   I can meet and exceed all the standards  and the people I work with  they like me  They have a lot of questions  but they don t have a problem  This has been an uneasy time for transgender troops in the United States military  caught between a commander in chief who wants them out and court injunctions that  at least temporarily  said they could stay   The last of the injunctions was lifted on Thursday  But dozens of transgender troops like Airman Crutcher said in interviews that they felt supported in the service  Their comrades and commanders have welcomed them  they said  and the military has often been more accepting than the homes and neighborhoods they left to enlist Nearly 1 000 troops officially deemed as transgender are currently serving in the American military  according to the Defense Department  and another 228 are in the process of enlisting  They are all over the globe in a wide spectrum of roles   infantry officers  armor platoon leaders  drill sergeants  intelligence specialists  Arabic linguists  nuclear reactor operators  A transgender instructor teaches leadership at the Naval Academy They started coming out publicly in 2016 when the military lifted a longtime ban  after concluding that doing so would have no significant negative impact on budgets or operations  But President Trump announced an abrupt reversal of policy on Twitter a year later  saying he would no longer allow transgender troops to serve  in any capacity  The Defense Department laid out its arguments for excluding transgender troops before the House Armed Services Committee late last month  James N  Stewart  a senior Pentagon official  testified that transgender troops were more prone to mental health issues than other troops  and that when they transition  medical treatments can make them nondeployable for months   factors that he said would make recruits ineligible to serve if they stemmed from other kinds of pre existing health conditions ImageAirman Crutcher worked out at a gym near his home   I can meet and exceed all the standards  and the people I work with  they like me   he said of his military service CreditAnnie Flanagan for The New York TimesMr  Stewart  who is a retired Air Force general  rejected calling the policy a ban  saying that the policy drafted after the president s Twitter announcement still allows transgender troops to serve  as long as they never transition He argued that having troops who have transitioned in the ranks could also raise complicated questions about physical fitness standards and access to shower and bathroom facilities that may upset others  leading  to unnecessary and debilitating leadership challenges  Other troops and military leaders disagree  Five transgender troops who also testified at the hearing said that  aside from the uncertainty created by the change in policy  they had encountered few problems transitioning in uniform  Instances of harassment have been few  according to Sparta  an association of transgender troops And in testimony before the Senate last spring  the heads of the Army  Navy  Air Force and Marine Corps all said they were not aware of any issues caused by having transgender troops serving openly Airman Crutcher says that few people outside his unit realize he is transgender  He relaxes on weekends by playing video games and has Airsoft gun battles with the other troops from his unit  There s nothing remarkable about him either way   said Senior Airman Kyle Daily  who serves in the same squadron   There are some people in the unit who don t agree with what he is  but they re the minority  Many transgender recruits come from socially conservative small towns or strict religious upbringings  and have spent their youth feeling like misfits  Some troops who were born anatomically male said in interviews that they enlisted with the initial hope that military service would drum feminine feelings out of them  I hoped it would straighten me out   I didn t want my family to hate me   said Aylanna Anderson  an Air Force staff sergeant who was raised Catholic in a tiny West Texas town and became an Eagle Scout   I hoped I could leave what I saw as this dark part of me behind  ImageAirman Crutcher says that few people outside his unit realize that he is transgender CreditAnnie Flanagan for The New York TimesTo her surprise  after enlisting in 2012  Sergeant Anderson said  she found a culture that emphasized judging people by ability  not identity  She began to transition to female in 2017  The military has been very freeing   she said by phone from Kunsan Air Base in South Korea  where she repairs electronics in F 16 fighters   I don t know if I could have done it otherwise  Airman Crutcher  who grew up in a Pentecostal household in rural Missouri  said he wrote a heartfelt letter to his family about his lifelong sense of being a boy in a girl s body  but they refused to read it  asking him instead if he was on drugs By contrast  when he came out to his Air Force commander  he said the reaction was   What do I need to do for you  I want to make sure you are supported  A few days back from a deployment to Guam with his bomber squadron  he was shopping for a crib with his pregnant wife when they got a text from his mother But it wasn t his birth mother  who he says essentially disowned him after he told her in 2015 that he was transgender  It was his Air Force mother   Kim Thomas  the wife of a lieutenant colonel  who informally adopted him after meeting him during basic training  He now spends holidays with her family and calls her Mom  She s the best   Airman Crutcher said as he leaned over his wife s phone to see the photo Ms  Thomas had sent of a new outfit for the baby   It was life changing to have that support of family who love me no matter what  Ms  Thomas said taking Airman Crutcher under her wing came naturally   Here is this amazing kid who volunteered to fight and die for our country   she said   We are not going to allow him to go through the military without support  ImageCapt  Alivia Stehlik  an Army physical therapist stationed at Fort Carson  Colo  She said her transition should be seen as an asset  not a burden CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesA 2016 RAND Corporation study found that nearly one fifth of transgender troops do not plan to transition medically  Those who do transition may  depending on gender and preference  undergo hormone therapy  breast removal and other procedures  like surgery to make facial features and voices more gender appropriate  All are covered by the military Transitioning troops can also request surgery to change their genitals  but the approval process and recovery time can be lengthy  The Defense Department did not respond to questions about how many such gender reassignment procedures had been performed on troops since the ban was lifted in 2016  Sparta estimates the figure at about six The cost and disruption associated with surgery is a chief complaint of critics  but the  RAND study estimated that those factors would be negligible  with fewer than 200 active troops transitioning per year at a total cost of less than  10 million  In interviews  troops who have transitioned said they tried to time their surgical procedures for scheduled lulls in unit activity  and sometimes put them off because of deployments or demanding work assignments Even so  transitioning can detour careers  Some Sparta members said they had been removed from sensitive jobs such as pilots  air traffic controllers or nuclear missile operators  out of concern that they might be mentally unstable Regulations can get in the way  as well  Airman Crutcher was sent home early from a 2016 deployment to Qatar when medical staff discovered that the testosterone treatments he was receiving violated a rule about injected medications for troops deployed in the region  I was crushed   he said   My major called me in and said he had fought for me to stay  but it was regulations  Capt  Alivia Stehlik is a transgender woman who graduated from West Point as a man in 2008  completed the Army s punishing Ranger School and led an infantry platoon  She is now an Army physical therapist stationed at Fort Carson  Colo In an interview at her home  she said her transition should be seen as an asset  not a burden She volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan with an infantry brigade last spring after the unit s regular physical therapist became pregnant  Captain Stehlik spent nearly a year hopping helicopters from base to base  treating sprains and other injuries with a medical bag in one hand and an M 4 rifle in the other Six foot three and broad shouldered  she said it would have been pretty obvious to the 1 700 soldiers she treated that she was transgender  but it was never a problem  It s not just that as a woman I can still do the same job I did as a man   I can actually do it better   Captain Stehlik said   People were actually more open with me because I had made myself more vulnerable to them  I think if I were still a guy  they might have downplayed how much things hurt  tried to act tough  And I might have  too  
For President Trump  the era of congressional oversight is shaping up to be a family affair  with his three eldest children   Donald Jr   Ivanka and Eric   at risk of getting swept up in multiple investigations  But none of the Trump clan may face a more thorough going over than Jared Kushner  the president s son in law and top White House adviser Mr  Kushner this week was among a long list of Trumpworld intimates asked to provide documents to the House Judiciary Committee as it looks into possible presidential misdeeds This request landed just as the continuing tussle was heating up between Mr  Kushner and the House Oversight and Reform Committee  which is examining claims that Mr  Trump arranged to have his son in law granted top secret security clearance over the objections of intelligence officials In both cases  the White House has signaled its intent to defy Congress  arguing executive privilege and legislative overreach  On Monday  the White House counsel  Pat Cipollone  sent a letter to the oversight committee chairman  Elijah Cummings  rebuffing his request and effectively daring him to start issuing subpoenas  Mr  Cummings said he would confer with colleagues to determine what comes next However Democrats proceed  Mr  Kushner s peculiar role in his father in law s White House has prompted widespread concern that is both broader and more specific than the generic questions of accountability and competence often raised by raw nepotism Unease about Mr  Kushner s access to secret information appears to go beyond politics  Mr  Trump s own intelligence officials are said to have balked at the idea of giving his son in law such access  as did Donald McGahn during his stint as White House counsel Mr  Trump overrode such advice and ordered Mr  Kushner s clearance granted  which it was last May These were not casual  offhand objections  After the president made his decision  Mr  McGahn was reportedly so troubled that he wrote an internal memo detailing the concerns about Mr  Kushner   including from the C I A    and making clear that he had recommended against the move John Kelly  at that time the White House chief of staff  is said to have felt similarly moved to write a memo stating that he had been explicitly  ordered  by the president to grant Mr  Kushner s clearance If true  this is yet another point on which Mr  Trump has misled the public  insisting in January that he had played no role in arranging his son in law s clearance  Just last month  Ivanka Trump made a similar claim  asserting that her father  had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband s clearance  zero  Those untruths are nowhere near as troubling as the fact that intelligence and administration officials were reportedly loath to grant Mr  Kushner access to the government s deepest secrets What was the C I A  s specific hesitation concerning Mr  Kushner and top secret information  Why does the agency continue to deny him access to  sensitive compartmentalized information   Why did the F B I  raise questions about foreign influence over Mr  Kushner As The Times reported last month  The full scope of intelligence officials  concerns about Mr  Kushner is not known  But the clearance had been held up in part over questions from the F B I  and the C I A  about his foreign and business contacts  including those related to Israel  the United Arab Emirates and Russia  according to multiple people familiar with the events   Mr  Kushner s inaccurate statements to the F B I  about his foreign interactions are cause for additional concern And many  many eyebrows have been raised over Mr  Kushner s special friendship with Mohammed bin Salman  the crown prince of Saudi Arabia   a coziness strategically and aggressively cultivated by the Saudis  Out of fear that Mr  Kushner  naïve in the ways of diplomacy and foreign affairs  was susceptible to manipulation by the prince  Mr  Kelly attempted to curtail the two men s private talks by reinstating a requirement that National Security Council officials participate in calls with foreign leaders  No matter  Mr  Kushner and Prince Mohammed s bond grew  even withstanding the conclusion by American intelligence agencies that the prince ordered the torture and murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi  Amid global outrage over the killing  Mr  Kushner has been among the prince s fiercest defenders Mr  Kushner is not a low level White House functionary  He has been charged with bringing peace to the Middle East  and he is the president s star emissary to the Saudi government  The public has a compelling interest in knowing what made the intelligence community so nervous about him  Putting a member of the president s family in the investigatory hot seat is a delicate business  Voters can get squeamish watching a politician s wife or daughter or son in law field tough questions  That s no excuse for letting them avoid

Chris Wallace sounded a little bit wistful  and a little bit wry  I m disappointed   he said by telephone on Thursday   There would have been a certain man bites dog quality to it  the Democrats showing up on Fox  But Mr  Wallace  the  Fox News Sunday  moderator  had to put aside his hope for a Fox News sponsored Democratic primary debate on Wednesday  when Democratic officials rejected the idea in an unusually sharp rebuke  To be banned  or boycotted  for the 12 debates over the next year  is kind of stunning   he said in his first extended comments on the matter   There are a lot of voters that a Democrat is going to need to get elected president who watch Fox News  People in the Rust Belt states  the rural areas that Hillary Clinton lost  They would have been able to see the Democratic candidates make their arguments about why they re better able to represent their interests  The Democratic chairman  Tom Perez  attributed his rejection of Fox News in part to an article published by The New Yorker that  he wrote  chronicled  the inappropriate relationship between President Trump  his administration and Fox News  Mr  Wallace   a formidable interviewer who in 2016 became the first Fox News journalist to moderate a general election debate   seemed dubious about that  Do I think Tom Perez read the New Yorker article and suddenly said   Oh  my gosh  there s gambling going on in the back room   No   he said   There is a visceral antipathy to Fox News among the left wing of the Democratic Party  and I think they saw this as a good opportunity to make a decision that I m sure the D N C  was under a lot of pressure to make  Fox News has had poor luck persuading Democrats to allow its journalists   who  the network says  operate separately from its partisan pundits   to host an official forum for the party s presidential candidates  Executives there spent months lobbying Democratic officials for a 2020 opportunity  though its prospects this time looked dimmer than ever After all  Mr  Trump is a devoted viewer who responds in real time to  Fox   Friends   counts a former Fox News co president as his deputy chief of staff  dines at the White House with Fox News stars like Sean Hannity and Jesse Watters  consults with Fox News commentators on policy decisions and sees his talking points beamed back at him every weeknight during the Fox News prime time block Image To be banned  or boycotted  for the 12 debates over the next year  is kind of stunning   said Chris Wallace  the  Fox News Sunday  moderator CreditIlya S  Savenok Getty ImagesSo  do the Democrats kind of have a point  I can understand where some of the programming on Fox News  at various parts of the day  would give Democrats heartburn   Mr  Wallace said   I can also understand why there s programming on in parts of the day on CNN and MSNBC   or  frankly  on the broadcast networks   that would give Donald Trump and Republicans heartburn  The question is  can you distinguish between the serious straight news reporters and the opinion people   he added  noting that Rachel Maddow  the liberal opinion host  co moderated an NBC News debate with Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016  Sean Hannity and our other opinion people aren t going to be onstage with the candidates   Mr  Wallace added  of a potential Fox News debate Mr  Perez  the Democratic chairman  went out of his way to praise Mr  Wallace during a pair of TV appearances on Wednesday  telling Chris Hayes on MSNBC that  my concern is not about Chris Wallace   it s about people above Chris Wallace   Mr  Wallace said that he expected Mr  Perez to return to his  Fox News Sunday  program  and that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had agreed to appear  as well  While some liberals expressed glee at the Democrats  decision  the CNN host Chris Cuomo on Wednesday subjected Mr  Perez to an on air grilling about the logic behind his decision   It seems like you re just asking for more division in a campaign season that s supposed to be about trying to find ways have less division   Mr  Cuomo said  I see my role as making sure that everything we do is ensuring that our candidates are treated fairly   Mr  Perez replied The president also weighed in  piping up on Twitter to threaten a boycott of debates moderated by  Fake News Networks  in the general election  This does give President Trump a pretty good excuse to decide if and when he ll do debates in the general election   Mr  Wallace said   If the Democrats are going to boycott certain venues  maybe the president will  too   I think that d be a huge mistake  I think that d be bad for the country   he added   But the Democrats have opened the door to the president being able to say now we re going to pick and choose where we answer questions from  
WASHINGTON   The House passed the Democrats  showcase anti corruption and voting rights legislation on Friday  an expansive measure that aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box  end big money in politics and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials The sweeping legislation  passed 234 193  makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington that helped catapult Democrats into the majority  It also serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020  It has virtually no chance of passing the Senate  It s a power grab for the American people   said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California  who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation The ambitious compendium  at nearly 700 pages  includes proposals designating Election Day as a federal holiday  automatically registering citizens to vote  and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences  It also creates a six to one matching system for donations of up to  200 to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high dollar contributions  funded by an additional fine on corporations found to have broken the law Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill   called the For the People Act or H R  1  to underscore its primacy   and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  has branded it the  Democrat Politician Protection Act  in weekly speeches  and pledged not to take up the legislation  The House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  also criticized the legislation  This bill is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections   Mr  McCarthy said in a speech on Friday  in an attack on  this new  Democrat  socialist majority  Some of the most debated provisions are intended to reveal who funds online political ads and finances so called dark money groups  The Disclose Act  part of the bill  would require super PACs and nonprofit organizations that spend money in elections to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than  10 000  Democrats say such disclosure is broadly popular with voters across the political spectrum ImageRepresentative Ayanna Pressley  Democrat of Massachusetts  proposed an amendment that would have lowered the voting age in federal elections to 16 CreditErin Schaff The New York Times Congress cannot meaningfully address the nation s significant challenges without first recognizing and acknowledging the undue influence of special interests in our politics   said Representative Abigail Spanberger  Democrat of Virginia Some of those provisions  however  have drawn criticism from both conservative and liberal groups that argue the language is overly broad and would infringe on First Amendment rights  The American Civil Liberties Union urged members to vote against the bill Democrats have also used the legislation to make clear that they believe that cleanup must start with the White House  and included several provisions jabbing at the president and homing in on a laundry list of his administration s alleged ethical abuses It would require presidents and vice presidents  as well as candidates for the nation s highest offices  to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns   Mr  Trump has released none   and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures And an amendment sponsored by Representative Raul Ruiz of California would prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned or controlled by the president  the vice president or any cabinet official  Federal agencies spent about  13 million on four of Mr  Trump s trips to his Mar a Lago resort in Florida in early 2017  according to a report by a nonpartisan congressional watchdog agency issued last month Two other measures also zero in on the costs of administration officials  travel  One provision would require the Defense Department to regularly report to Congress details of the costs of presidential travel  the other would prohibit political appointees from using federal funds to pay for travel on noncommercial or private flights for official business  We must hold our government leaders to the highest standards  and with so many high profile ethics violations in the past years  it is clear we have failed to do that   Representative Tom O Halleran  Democrat of Arizona and the sponsor of the amendments  said in a statement Democrats also successfully put down an attempt by Republicans to divide the caucus and tar the legislation with a resolution expressing the sense that  allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens  Republicans have repeatedly ambushed Democrats   twice successfully   with politically freighted procedural motions in a drive to divide Democrats and draw out vulnerable swing district members  But determined not to let that taint their signature legislation and fired up by a rousing speech from freshman Representative Max Rose of New York  Democrats held steady

WASHINGTON   The federal budget deficit is ballooning on President Donald Trump s watch and few in Washington seem to care And even if they did  the political dynamics that enabled bipartisan deficit cutting deals decades ago has disappeared  replaced by bitter partisanship and chronic dysfunction That s the reality that will greet Trump s latest budget   which will promptly be shelved after landing with a thud on Monday  Like previous spending blueprints  Trump s plan for the 2020 budget year will propose cuts to many domestic programs favored by lawmakers in both parties but leave alone politically popular retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security Washington probably will devote months to wrestling over erasing the last remnants of a failed 2011 budget deal that would otherwise cut core Pentagon operations by  71 billion and domestic agencies and foreign aid by  55 billion  Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of three prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending rather than defray deficits that are again approaching  1 trillion It s put deficit hawks in a gloomy mood  The president doesn t care  The leadership of the Democratic Party doesn t care   said former Sen  Judd Gregg  R N H   And social media is in stampede mode  Trump s budget arrives as the latest Treasury Department figures show a 77 percent spike in the deficit over the first four months of the budget year  driven by falling revenues and steady growth in spending Trump s 2017 tax cut bears much of the blame  along with sharp increases in spending for both the Pentagon and domestic agencies and the growing federal retirement costs of the baby boom generation  Promises that the tax cut would stir so much economic growth that it would mostly pay for itself have been proved woefully wrong Trump s upcoming budget  however  won t address any of the main factors behind the growing  intractable deficits that have driven the U S  debt above  22 trillion  Its most striking proposed cuts   to domestic agency operations   were rejected when tea party Republicans controlled the House  and they face equally grim prospects now that Democrats are in the majority Trump has given no indication he s much interested in the deficit and he s rejected any idea of curbing Medicare or Social Security  the massive federal retirement programs whose imbalances are the chief deficit drivers An administration official said Friday that the president s plan promises to balance the budget in 15 years  The official was not authorized to publicly discuss specifics about the budget before the document s official release and spoke on condition of anonymityDemocrats have witnessed the retirement of a generation of lawmakers who came up in the 1980s and 1990s and negotiated deficit cutting deals in 1990 and 1993  But those agreements came at significant political cost to both President George H W  Bush  who lost re election  and President Bill Clinton  whose party lost control of Congress in 1995 But the moderate wing of the Democratic Party has withered with the electoral wipeout of  Blue Dog  Democrats at the hands of tea party forces over recent election cycles  Concern about the deficit is so woefully out of fashion that it s hard to even imagine it coming back into fashion   said Rep  Jim Cooper  D Tenn   one of his party s few remaining deficit hawks   This is as out of fashion as bell bottoms  While in charge of the House  Republicans used to generate nonbinding budget blueprints that promised to balance the federal ledger by relying on a controversial plan to eventually transform Medicare into a voucher like program  But they never pursued follow up legislation that would actually do it Republicans  who seized Congress more than two decades ago promising and ultimately achieving balanced budgets during the Clinton administration  have instead focused on two major rounds of tax cuts during the Trump era and the administration of President George W  Bush in 2001 Nor are Republicans willing to consider tough deficit cutting steps such as higher taxes or Pentagon budget cuts  Leading Democratic presidential contenders talk of  Medicare for All  and increasing Social Security benefits instead of curbing them  You have to get pretty damn serious about revenue as well as defense spending  and those are two things the Republicans don t want to bring into the conversation   said Sen  Dick Durbin  D Ill   My Democratic friends who talk about expansion of benefits  I ve told them to  get real   Trump has never gone to the mat for his plan to slash domestic spending such as renewable energy programs  If Trump can be criticized I think the perception has been that he has not fought for the spending cuts that he s proposed   said former Sen  Jim DeMint  R S C   There s no upside to trying to cut anything  There s no political reward  But if you cut something there s a lot of political downside  Neither is there any reservoir of the political will and bipartisan trust required to take the political heat for the tough steps it would take to rein in deficits  And it s not like voters are clamoring for action  There s been very little dialogue in the last several years about debt and deficit and how to really be able to address it   said Sen  James Lankford  R Okla   It just never came up  in the 2016 election   It still doesn t come up  The deficit registered  714 billion during Trump s first year in office but is projected to hit about  900 billion this year  according to the Congressional Budget Office  which says Trump s tax cut will add  1 5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years  One of the short term goals should be   I know it s not a lofty goal   stopping things from getting a lot worse  It s something the Republicans obviously were unable to do  That s a low bar  but they couldn t meet a low bar   said Sen  Chris Van Hollen  D Md    AP Congressional Correspondent

BEIJING   President Trump says he is optimistic that a landmark trade deal with China is close  Chinese officials are not so sure The two sides in recent weeks agreed to the broad outlines of an agreement that would roll back tariffs in both countries  with China buying more American goods and opening up some markets to foreign goods  The trade deal looks like a good one for Beijing  since it would largely spare the government from making substantive changes to its economy But some of the biggest details   like the enforcement mechanism to ensure China complies and the timing for the removal of tariffs   still haven t been hammered out  Beijing officials are wary that the final terms may be less favorable  especially given Mr  Trump s propensity for last minute changes  according to two people familiar with China s position  The work team is still continuing to negotiate because we still have a lot to do   Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said on the sidelines of the 11 day annual session of the National People s Congress  which began on Tuesday  At the legislative meeting  senior Chinese officials have been taking turns warning that challenges remain The emerging gap is starting to put in doubt plans for President Xi Jinping to meet with Mr  Trump in late March or early April to sign a deal Chinese officials face an obvious dilemma in asking their president to fly all the way to Mr  Trump s Mar a Lago club in Florida without a clear understanding of the final details  And persuading Mr  Xi to attend such a summit meeting is no easy task  given his imperative of appearing strong before a domestic audience  If they re going to send their president all the way to Florida  they have to know there s an agreement in the end   said James Green  who until August was the top trade official at the United States Embassy in Beijing and is now a fellow at Georgetown University Mr  Trump s meeting last week with the North Korean leader  Kim Jong un  in Hanoi  Vietnam  serves as a cautionary tale  The meeting ended abruptly when the American president decided the North Koreans were not offering sufficient terms Over the past two years  Chinese negotiators have also repeatedly believed they had a deal  only for it to come apart at the last minute  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the summer of 2017 presented a plan  which Mr  Trump quickly disavowed  They thought they had an understanding with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last year  focused on cars and financial services  and then Mr  Trump imposed tariffs It s a difficult position for the Chinese  who want to avoid an embarrassment  Mr  Trump is unpredictable  and China can t be assured he won t change his mind when the two presidents meet But the Chinese also recognize that a presidential summit meeting may be the only path to completing a deal  since Mr  Trump has a tendency to undercut his advisers  A common view in China is that  Donald Trump is very interested in doing a deal himself   said Bo Zhiyue  the deputy dean of the New Era Development Research Institute at Xi an Jiaotong Liverpool University in Suzhou  China ImageChinese Premier Li Keqiang delivers a speech during the opening of the National People s Congress on Tuesday CreditAndrea Verdelli Getty ImagesThe United States and China have discussed holding further discussions in Beijing a few days after the National People s Congress ends on March 15  two people close to the trade talks said Michael Pillsbury  a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration  said that Mr  Xi s silence on the trade talks was an ominous sign  and that several of the points that the United States thought China had agreed to were far from settled  There may be the need for another round of talks before the signing summit   Mr  Pillsbury said The biggest barrier to a deal continues to be the enforcement of terms  people familiar with the discussions said  The United States has insisted that it retain the right to raise tariffs if China violates the agreement  without retaliation by Beijing  But some Chinese officials have criticized the arrangement as a potential infringement of China s sovereign rights  There are also disagreements over whether Beijing is going far enough in its promises to curb the forced transfer of American intellectual property as a condition of doing business in China Precisely how tariffs would be rolled back is still in play  too  If its conditions are met  the American negotiating team has signaled that it will lift 10 percent tariffs on roughly  200 billion of Chinese goods that Mr  Trump imposed last autumn  people familiar with the discussions said  But the fate of 25 percent tariffs imposed last summer on an additional  50 billion of goods is less clear  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  also prefers to roll back its tariffs over time as China makes changes to its law and economy  while China is arguing for them to be lifted altogether when the deal is signed  according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations Chinese officials are leery of continued talks  since they don t have to give up much under the current  albeit tenuous  agreement  And they do not want to commit China to structural changes in its economy  according to three people familiar with the negotiations The emerging deal would allow China to sign long term contracts for the purchase of oil  gas  soybeans and other natural resources that its economy needs and cannot easily produce at home  It wouldn t require Beijing to buy large volumes of American manufactured goods  which could threaten jobs in China s vast but slowing manufacturing sector The agreement would also do little to limit China s government programs to assist the development of high tech manufacturing  China sees its economy s long running evolution toward such industries as essential to creating the high paying jobs that its increasingly educated work force has begun to expect In a bid to appease Mr  Trump  China shelved last year the term for the initiative   Made in China 2025   The term had become a lightning rod for criticism in the United States  Premier Li Keqiang did not use it in his annual address to the National People s Congress on Tuesday  after using it in previous years  Asked about the omission of  Made in China 2025   Huang Shouhong  the director of the State Council Research Office and leader of the team that drafted the speech  said there was not room in the speech for every issue If the United States presses too hard  Beijing is also likely to take the position that no deal is better than a deal that could limit China s economic development  And it is preparing for that possibility The national budget outlined by Mr  Li on Tuesday includes corporate tax cuts and extra lending from the government controlled banking sector  That could help them weather trade frictions  however long they last  and bounce back from a recent credit crunch that has particularly affected smaller private companies Four fifths of the savings from the main corporate tax cut announced on Tuesday will ultimately flow to manufacturers  said Mr  Huang  They have faced many difficulties   he said   Therefore  this time the focus of tax reduction is on small and micro enterprises and manufacturing enterprises

The Democratic National Committee s decision to bar Fox News from hosting a 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate will undoubtedly  and understandably  prove to be a popular decision with the party s core  primarily coastal base But it s also very shortsighted and could hurt the party and its candidates  In the minds of many progressive Democrats  Fox News may be synonymous with Sean Hannity  But in the minds of many other Americans  Fox News is synonymous with what they put on to watch Bret Baier  Shepard Smith or Chris Wallace These Fox News anchors and personalities do not do the bidding of the Trump administration   go find Mr  Wallace s recent grilling of the Trump anti immigration White House policy adviser Stephen Miller if you re unsure  It s not a given that their viewers are entirely die hard Trump fans  or even Republicans  Fox News   the actual news part   is indeed consumed by some Democrats and independents  And its viewership numbers are big enough that the D N C  is  in its way  cutting off its nose to spite its face by leaving those potential voters on the table and unspoken to According to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey  3 percent of 2016 Hillary Clinton voters cited Fox as their principal news source  exactly one percentage point behind the number who cited NBC and two points behind those who cited The New York Times as the  main source  of their news  Critically  Pew asked its question about  main sources  in an open ended way  they were not pushing anyone to reply  Fox News  Pew data from 2014 shows similar trends  5 percent of people who called themselves  mostly liberal  cited Fox News as their  main source  of news about government and politics  the same number as cited MSNBC   So did 8 percent of those with  mixed  political views  MSNBC didn t rate with them at all  According to New York Times reporting from 2012  a quarter of  Fox and Friends  viewers were Democrats or Democratic leaners  9 percent were independents It s possible that in the era of Trump  those numbers have shifted a lot  It s also possible that every Democrat or independent who watches Fox is a  hate viewer  or views it on mute just to see super telegenic anchors smiling and looking friendly But it s more likely given that Fox has been the most watched cable network for 17 years straight  some people who tune in are people Democrats actually want and need to vote for their candidates  That will be especially the case if the economy starts to sour   February s job numbers offer a hint of that   and voters who were previously more favorable to Mr  Trump start to turn on him  That could easily happen in places where Fox is most likely consumed more by Democrats and independents   like Iowa  the first caucus state  where many farmers are reeling from the effect of Mr  Trump s tariffs and where  in a packed primary field  10 votes here or 10 votes there might make the difference between who emerges as a real contender for the nomination and who is culled straight out of the gate This was presumably the logic behind Senator Kirsten Gillibrand s decision to sit down for an interview with Mr  Wallace last month  Some Democrats criticized her for it  but according to a Washington Post media reporter  over two million people tuned in  Compare that with CNN s town halls with Senator Bernie Sanders  1 35 million viewers   Senator Kamala Harris  1 95 million   Senator Amy Klobuchar  1 15 million  and Howard Schultz  1 02 million   Ms  Gillibrand may be on to something here  even if the Democratic Party as a whole is not  As a Republican who watches CNN and does not plan to vote in Virginia s Democratic primary next year  I d say Ms  Gillibrand probably is  I bet the conservative commentator and talk radio host Erick Erickson  who  prefers  CNN to Fox but has pledged to vote for Mr  Trump  agrees Apart from those numbers and facts  there s another reason Democrats shouldn t bar Fox News from hosting a debate  Ever heard the old political saying that you should never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel  It s actually true  Diving into the  media bias  trough and attacking actual news organizations   and Fox News is one  as demonstrated by a roster of reporters that includes John Roberts and Ed Henry   is the last refuge of losing political organizations and candidates who will not triumph on the day  It s an easy  base hit  that gins up existing supporters and makes them extra motivated by feeling hard done by media elites In some cases  it may even be 100 percent true  But think about it historically  Virtually every time you see a candidate or political group respond by explicitly screaming  media bias   they end up losing the election they are fighting to win or whatever battle they find themselves in  It happened in 2008  it happened in 2012  and it happened in 2016 The D N C  people do not want to play that game  even if short term they think it s good for getting people who otherwise could not give a monkey s uncle about the committee to pony up more  5 and  10 donations   It probably will be  and very likely that s a lot of what this is about   Smart political campaigns are about looking ahead to where things will most likely stand and what votes will be needed on Election Day   or the beginning of early voting   and not responding to whatever the drama of the day or the week is  Democrats hate Fox  and the pressure not to lend them credibility or  punish  it by allowing it to host a debate is immense  But giving into it is ultimately more likely than not to prove shortsighted and pointless  The  no Fox debate  rabble rousers will vote Democratic anyway  those Democrats and independents watching Fox might not  Suck it up and do the debate  It s the smarter move strategically more on fox newsOpinion   Bret Stephens  What Have the Elites Ever Done for Fox Jan  4  2019Liz Mair  who was a strategist for campaigns by Scott

WASHINGTON   The government s consumer watchdog agency came under new scrutiny from the House Financial Services Committee  now controlled by Democrats who say the appointees chosen by President Donald Trump to lead the organization have undermined its mission to protect Americans A fresh rebuke came Thursday from the committee s chair  Rep  Maxine Waters  D Calif   as the new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau appeared before the panel In December  Kathy Kraninger succeeded Mick Mulvaney  now Trump s acting chief of staff  Mulvaney hired Republican political operatives to oversee nearly all of the agency s operations  The Trump administration has undertaken a sustained effort to destroy the agency   Waters said   I m committed to reversing the damage that Mulvaney caused  As a congressman from South Carolina  Mulvaney described the bureau as a  sick  sad  joke  When he was made director  Mulvaney pushed for cutbacks on many of the rules and regulations that were put into place under the first director during the Obama administration Democrats opposed Kraninger s appointment in the fall  saying she had little relevant experience  She s an attorney who had worked as a mid level official in the White House s budget office  most recently under Mulvaney  but has no experience in financial services or consumer protection and had never run a federal agency The CFPB was created as an independent agency by the landmark Dodd Frank law that overhauled the regulations governing Wall Street and banks in the wake of the 2008 09 financial crisis Republicans assailed the CFPB under President Barack Obama s appointee as director  saying he had overreached with his actions taken against companies selling financial products and services Consumer advocates expect Kraninger to run the agency as Mulvaney did In a major move under Kraninger  the agency said last month that it plans to abolish most of its critical consumer protections governing payday lenders  It s a big win for the payday lending industry  which asserted that the government s regulations could kill off a large chunk of its business Consumer groups say payday lenders exploit the poor and disadvantaged with loans carrying annual interest rates as high as 400 percent The cornerstone of the regulations is a requirement that lenders ensure that borrowers can afford to repay a payday loan without being stuck in a cycle of debt   a standard known as  ability to repay  Asked about the move on payday lending  Kraninger told the hearing that the practice  has a number of impacts on a number of different consumers   The agency s plan is still at a proposal stage  she said  and agency officials are examining evidence that could make or dispute the case for unfair and abusive practices by the payday loan industry Waters has proposed legislation that would direct Kraninger to reverse Mulvaney s actions as head of the CFPB in the areas of student loans  consumer complaints  fair lending rules and others  Waters  bill has gained several dozen Democratic supporters in the House Kraninger insisted  under a shower of criticisms and questions from Democrats  that she is not under the political influence of Trump or Mulvaney  I absolutely take seriously the responsibility vested in me  and the decisions I take at the CFPB are my decisions   Kraninger said  She said she has never received a directive from Trump or felt pressure to act in a way that the president or other White House officials might like Republicans defended Kraninger  accusing Democrats of setting a contentious tone after they  berated and badgered  her  At least one GOP lawmaker acknowledged he would prefer that the agency be abolished altogether  if possible  The good news is that it s a new day at the CFPB   said Rep  Patrick McHenry of North Carolina  the panel s top Republican  He decried  the ugly history of regulation by enforcement  during the Obama administration as  dangerous and destructive  The CFPB has the authority to scrutinize virtually any business selling financial products and services  credit card companies  payday lenders  mortgage servicers  debt collectors  for profit colleges  auto lenders and money transfer agents Under its first  Obama appointed director  the agency pursued enforcement actions against an array of companies large and small  saying that it returned tens of billions of dollars to consumers harmed by illegal practices 
WASHINGTON   The Pentagon is planning to tap  1 billion in leftover funds from military pay and pension accounts to help President Donald Trump pay for his long sought border wall  a top Senate Democrat said Thursday Sen  Dick Durbin  D Ill   told The Associated Press   It s coming out of military pay and pensions   1 billion  That s the plan  Durbin said the funds are available because Army recruitment is down and a voluntary early military retirement program is being underutilized The development comes as Pentagon officials are seeking to minimize the amount of wall money that would come from military construction projects that are so cherished by lawmakers Durbin said   Imagine the Democrats making that proposal   that for whatever our project is  we re going to cut military pay and pensions  Durbin  the top Democrat on the Appropriations panel for the Pentagon  was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Thursday morning The Pentagon is planning to transfer money from various accounts into a fund dedicated to drug interdiction  with the money then slated to be redirected for border barriers and other purposes More attention has been paid to Trump s declaration of a national emergency to tap up to  3 6 billion from military construction projects to pay for the wall  The Democratic controlled House voted last month to reject Trump s move  and the GOP held Senate is likely to follow suit next week despite a White House lobbying push Senate Republicans met again Wednesday to sort through their options in hopes of making next week s voting more politically palatable  They are struggling to come up with an alternative to simply voting up or down on the House measure as required under a never used Senate procedure to reject a presidential emergency declaration  Lawmakers in both parties believe Trump is inappropriately infringing on Congress  power of the purse Senators are increasingly uneasy ahead of voting next week because they don t know exactly where the money to build the wall will come from and if it will postpone military projects in their home states Vice President Mike Pence told senators during their meeting a week ago that he would get back to them with an update  But senators said they don t yet have a response from the administration  It s a concern   said Sen  John Cornyn  R Texas  He said a number of senators have been talking to the White House about other ways the administration could shuffle the money without relying on the authority under the emergency declaration  which is likely to become tied up in litigation The pitch is   Why have this additional controversy when it could be done in a less controversial way   he said   Apparently  the White House is not persuaded  The Army missed its recruiting goal this year  falling short by about 6 500 soldiers  despite pouring an extra  200 million into bonuses and approving some additional waivers for bad conduct or health issues Congress also appropriated money to give members of the military incentive to take early retirement  but enrollment in the program is coming in well under expectations  This is pay that would have gone to Army recruits that we can t recruit   Durbin said   So there s a  savings  because we can t recruit  The other part was they offered a voluntary change in military pensions  and they overestimated how many people would sign up for it  
President Trump claimed last June to have ended the practice of separating immigrant families at the southern border   We are going to keep the families together   he declared from the Oval Office Mr  President  meet Clemente and his daughter Wendy  both fleeing gang violence in Guatemala  Your administration separated them six months ago and kept them apart These family separations  continuing but at a lower level than before  are an element of the real  emergency  at the border   the one also involving physical and sexual abuse of immigrant children in U S  custody and systematic deception from Washington The paradox is that Trump s cruel policy to deter desperate immigrants appears counterproductive  apparently the furor it provoked drew attention to the possibility of migration  The result is a surge of Central American families traveling to the United States  with the number crossing the border far higher than a year earlier  Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world  shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes  For a behind the scenes look at Nick s gritty journalism  sign up for his newsletter  Clemente  34  is from a small Guatemalan village  He doesn t want to use his last name because of all he has been through at the hands of the U S  government  There is no way to verify parts of his story  but individuals who work with immigrants say it rings true A gang in Guatemala murdered his cousin  and last year gangsters stabbed Clemente s father and sent warnings to Clemente   It s now your turn  Terrified  Clemente fled with his eldest daughter  Wendy  then 15  leaving his wife and five other  younger children  whom he did not believe the gang would target  He feared that the gang would abduct Wendy  an excellent student who loves books  and he could not bear that thought They crossed Mexico without serious incident  then waded across the Rio Grande and turned themselves in to Border Patrol officers  requesting asylum  That was Aug  20  two months after Trump said he had ended the family separation policy  But officials promptly separated Clemente and Wendy Clemente was put in a  hielera   or ice box  notorious detention rooms predating Trump that are kept cold  Clemente  wet from the river crossing  was soon freezing as well as hungry and weak because he had given his food to Wendy   As a dad  the last thing you want is for your daughter to suffer   he explained simply   So I gave everything to her  In this frail state  he caught pneumonia and passed out  Many hours went by before he was taken to a hospital  unconscious and gravely ill  Inadequate health care in detention centers is common  and two migrant children died in December in Border Patrol custody  I woke up in the hospital  and I didn t know where I was   Clemente told me   It was a nightmare  My first question was   Where s my daughter    After he was released from the hospital and later from detention  he found himself on the streets of Brownsville  Tex  He was distraught and he was crying   recalled Sergio Cordova  a volunteer in Brownsville who does heroic work with immigrants  funded by donations  and discovered Clemente at the bus station   I gave him a hug and he started saying he can t find his daughter  he doesn t know where his daughter is  Eventually  Clemente discovered that she was in a shelter  She was allowed to telephone him once a week  but not return to his care  his voice broke as he described her as  an angel from God  Immigration is a complicated challenge  but ripping families apart isn t the solution  Perhaps the best approach is to help improve security in Central America so that people like Clemente need not flee  Some anti gang initiatives there have been very successful in reducing murder rates that drive migration  If it were peaceful  I d like to be back there where I grew up   said Clemente  who received help from Immigrant Families Together in his quest to reunite with his daughter   I d love to be in the land where I was born  The Texas Civil Rights Project found that at least 272 adults were separated from a child family member in the six months after Trump supposedly ended family separation  The youngest to be separated was an 8 month old girl taken from her mother READ MORE ABOUT THE CRISIS AT THE BORDERU S  Continues to Separate Migrant Families

WASHINGTON   The European Union will not support a comprehensive trade deal with the United States that includes agriculture  the EU s top trade negotiator said on Thursday  so she is working towards a narrower deal focused on industrial goods and automobiles The European Union s trade commissioner  Cecilia Malmstrom  said at a Georgetown Law School event that an industrial goods agreement could be achieved more quickly and could rebuild trust between the two largest trading blocs that had been eroded by U S  tariffs on steel and aluminium  If we start with industrial goods  which is much less complicated  and which will be beneficial from both sides  we maybe can rebuild that trust and then maybe we   ll see later  about agriculture  she said a day after meeting with U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer The EU and the United States spent three years trying to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal  the Trans Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  TTIP   but the talks failed to bridge gaps on allowing more U S  access to Europe for agricultural products  including genetically modified crops  wine and cheese   A full  comprehensive trade agreement   TTIP style  there is no support for that in the European Union right now  That   s the truth   Malmstrom said Europe has retaliated against the Trump administration s tariffs on EU produced steel and aluminium based on national security grounds  imposing tariffs on a range of U S  products from Harley Davidson motorcycles to bourbon whiskey U S  President Donald Trump is currently considering whether to impose similar  Section 232  tariffs on imported autos and auto parts on national security grounds  an action widely seen as a tool to gain negotiating leverage over the EU and Japan to lower their tariffs and non tariff barriers to U S  auto imports Trump pledged last year to European Union President Jean Claude Juncker that he would not impose such tariffs on EU made cars as long as there is progress in the negotiations But the two sides have not yet agreed on the scope of the talks  The U S  Trade Representative s office said in its negotiating objectives for the EU talks  published in January  that it would seek to reduce or eliminate EU tariffs and non tariff barriers to U S  farm products Members of the U S  Congress have demanded increased agriculture access to Europe  and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  an Iowa farmer  has said he does not see how a deal that excludes agriculture could win congressional approval  European member countries must approve two negotiating mandates to formally launch talks  But while Germany aims to start quickly  France has been more reluctant and remains adamantly opposed to talks on agriculture On Thursday  Malmstrom said the EU would be ready to launch negotiations with the United States within weeks She added that European officials would like to see cars and auto parts included in the talks  but said she had not seen any details about the U S  recommendations regarding related  Section 232  tariffs Malmstrom also called on the Trump administration to take a lead role in reforming the 24 year old World Trade Organization  whose rules have failed to address modern trade problems  such as China s excessive subsidies and technology transfer policies  Unless we save the international order  it may well be replaced and we might not like all of what we see   she said   Additional reporting by Alex Alper and Doina Chiacu  Writing by David Lawder and Susan Heavey  Editing by Jonathan Oatis and James Dalgleish 
WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is eyeing a plan to seek more money from allied European and other nations where American troops are based Several U S  officials said Friday that the White House has asked the Defense Department to gather data on the costs of keeping troops in other countries and how much those nations contribute to the expenses  The officials weren t authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations and spoke on the condition of anonymity President Donald Trump has waged a lengthy  public campaign to get NATO allies to meet the goal of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense  And in the last two years  a number of allies have increased their spending The officials said this latest effort is along those lines  They said the collection of data could be used in subsequent meetings and discussions to pressure allies to help offset the costs of having U S  troops within their borders The plan was first reported by Bloomberg National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said that getting U S  allies to  increase their investment in our collective defense and ensure fairer burden sharing  has been a long standing U S  goal  The Administration is committed to getting the best deal for the American people   Marquis said in a statement issued Friday He declined to provide details on any ongoing deliberations Most NATO allies have a U S  presence  but there are larger bases and military populations in countries such as Germany  England  Japan  Italy  Kuwait  Qatar and Bahrain Derek Chollet  former assistant defense secretary for international affairs  said that allies should pay their fair share  But  he said  the bases serve critical U S  interests and must not be considered charitable contributions For example  key U S  military commands that oversee operations in Europe and Africa are located in Germany as well as the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center  where thousands of American troops were treated after injuries in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars  The fact is that U S  bases are an essential part of protecting American interests   in Europe  Asia  Africa or the Middle East   said Chollet  now with the German Marshall Fund of the United States   Moreover  those countries that host our troops want to be our partners  and the message he  Trump  is sending is that we don t care  This is totally self defeating  Just last week  South Korea and the United States signed a deal that would increase Seoul s financial contribution for the deployment of U S  troops in the Asian country  After rounds of failed negotiations  chief delegates from the two countries last month agreed on Seoul paying about 1 04 trillion won  or  924 million  in 2019 for the U S  military presence  up from about  830 million last year There are about 28 500 U S  troops in South Korea 
WASHINGTON   The Environmental Protection Agency will attempt to stamp out speculation in the U S  biofuel credit market by barring trading by non industry players  publicizing large positions  and improving price transparency  a source familiar with the agency s proposals told Reuters on Thursday The measures  included in a broader policy reform under review by the Trump administration  are intended to help U S  oil refiners cope with the costs of complying with the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard  Under the law  passed in 2005 and expanded in 2007 partly to help expand farmers  market for corn  refiners must blend certain volumes of biofuels like ethanol into their fuel or purchase credits from those that do For years  refiners have complained that the market for such credits is vulnerable to manipulation that has at times caused prices to surge  and compliance costs to rise with them  Under the measures  parties such as banks and financial institutions that are not part of the fuel supply chain will not be permitted to trade biofuel credits  called Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs  according to the source Such traders have in the past acquired large volumes of the biofuel credits in speculative plays  forcing smaller players that require credits to comply with the biofuels law to scramble to buy them  often at higher prices Another of the five proposed measures to curb credit speculation calls for RIN buyers to disclose their holdings to the EPA if they acquire volumes beyond a certain threshold   likely 120 percent of their obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard  the source said The measures also require quarterly  instead of annual  retirement or sales of the credits to prevent  hoarding   a quarterly limit to how long credit stockpiles can be held  and improving EPA s market monitoring capabilities by collecting information about transactions  the source said  All this is meant to limit hoarding and create greater liquidity in the market place   the source said Michael Abboud  an EPA spokesman  declined to comment on the content of the proposal The EPA sent the draft rule to the White House for review on Monday  and hopes to finalize it before the summer driving season The anti speculation measures have been twinned with another EPA proposal to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline  called E15  year round  to help corn farmers supplying the ethanol industry President Donald Trump in October directed the EPA to draft the two part rule as a way to please both the oil and agricultural industries  crucial constituencies which have often bitterly battled over biofuels While the Renewable Fuel Standard has helped farmers by creating a 15 billion gallon a year market for corn based ethanol  oil refiners have increasingly complained that compliance costs them a fortune and threatens the very blue collar jobs Trump has promised to protect   Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk in Washington  Writing by Richard Valdmanis  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama  Matthew Lewis and Richard Chang 
WASHINGTON   The wife of a former FBI agent who vanished in Iran in 2007 expressed bitter frustration Thursday about efforts to get her husband back home Christine Levinson told a House panel that she holds Iran responsible for the disappearance of her husband  Robert  but she also said three American administrations have failed to press the Tehran government hard enough for his return  Time and time again  Bob has been left behind  deprioritized  or seemingly forgotten   she said at a House hearing on the status of Americans detained in Iran Robert Levinson vanished while in Iran on an unauthorized CIA mission  Christine Levinson said she believes her husband is alive and that the U S  should press Iran harder for answers  She praised the work of  some dedicated people from various agencies  but said others in the government have not communicated with each other regarding his case  or have questioned whether he is alive and have undercut efforts to secure his release  My husband served this country tirelessly for decades   she said   He deserves better from all of us and from our government  He deserves our endless pursuit to bring him home  to fight day and night and leave no stone unturned  Christine Levinson testified along with Babak Namazi whose Iranian American father and brother  Baquer and Siamak Namazi  are both serving 10 year sentences on espionage charges  Omar Zakka also told lawmaker about his father  Nizar Zakka  a Lebanese born U S  permanent resident who was detained after he visited Iran in 2015 to attend a conference Babak Namazi said that more than two years after President Donald Trump took office   it seems that we are not any closer in getting my family and other hostages home   He said time is running out for his 82 year old father  The elder Namazi s health is rapidly deteriorating and needs to leave Iran for medical attention  the son said There are at least five Americans being held in Iran in addition to one U S  permanent resident  The United Nations said last year that arrests of Americans in Iran are part of an  emerging pattern  by Tehran targeting dual nationalities  I am counting on President Trump to stay good to his word that Americans will not languish in Iran when he is president   Namazi said  citing the administration s recent successes freeing American hostages in other countries   I implore the president to spare no effort to bring my family and the other American hostages home from Iran  A hard line on Iran has been central to Trump s foreign policy  including withdrawing from a landmark nuclear deal and reinstating economic sanctions  He has pledged  serious consequences  if Americans detained in Iran are not returned Dan Levinson  Robert s son  said his family has been more hopeful following the reimposition of sanctions  We believe after dealing with the Iranians for 12 years now that they only respond to pressure and we think that it s the only way to bring them to the negotiating table   he told reporters before the hearing Robert Levinson was a contractor for the CIA who traveled in March 2007 to an Iranian island  Kish  where he met with a U S  fugitive  He has not been seen since except in a video sent to his family by his captors  His wife said in her testimony that an FBI assessment of the video and photos showing him in an orange jumpsuit concluded that the Iranian government must have developed them and sent them to the family   All the facts of the case indicate they kidnapped my husband   she said Iran has said Levinson is not in the country and that it has no further information about him Rep  Ted Deutch  chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that held the hearing  asked the family members what their message would be to Trump  I would ask that he would meet with us   Christine Levinson said   He doesn t know us  He doesn t understand how difficult it is for us  After the hearing  Deutch  D Fla   and three other members of Congress introduced legislation that would empower the president to impose sanctions on hostage takers  elevate the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs to the rank of ambassador  and create an interagency group that would work on hostage recovery and response 
WASHINGTON   Judge T S  Ellis III offered some pointed advice for those who expected him to throw the book at President Trump s former campaign chairman  Paul Manafort  for perpetrating a decade long  multimillion dollar fraud scheme  Go and spend a day in the jail or penitentiary of the federal government   Judge Ellis said on Thursday night from the bench in the United States District Court in Alexandria  Va   Spend a week there  He has to spend 47 months  Judge Ellis dismissed as  vindictive  and  way out of whack  sentencing guidelines that recommended a prison term of 19 to 24 years for Mr  Manafort  69 But to more than a few legal experts  it was Judge Ellis s sentence that was out of whack  They cited it as a glaring example of the leniency that wealthy white collar criminals often receive because they have the money to defend themselves or because judges find it easier to empathize with them  There are a lot of defendants who are going to prison for a lot longer for offenses that are far less serious   said Duncan Levin  a former federal prosecutor who specialized in financial crimes   This sentence is leaving me and a lot of people who do this every day scratching our heads  By some calculations  with credit for the nine months he has already spent in jail  plus a break included in a sentencing law just approved by Congress  Mr  Manafort could serve out Judge Ellis s sentence in just 22 months The judge had predicted some pushback  but he may not have expected how his decision reverberated around the nation  provoking a social media firestorm that swept up public defenders  prosecutors and ordinary citizens  William N  Nettles  a former United States attorney in South Carolina  called Judge Ellis s decision  sentencing disparity on steroids   How in the world can we make sense of the sentences that we have been handing down to the poor and to those people of color who didn t have nearly the opportunities that Paul Manafort had to make an honest living   asked Mr  Nettles  who was an Obama administration appointee Scott Hechinger  a public defender in Brooklyn and a pithy presence on criminal justice on Twitter  made a similar point   For context on Manafort s 47 months in prison  my client yesterday was offered 36 72 months in prison for stealing  100 worth of quarters from a residential laundry room   he wrote Many legal experts criticize sentencing guidelines as unduly punitive  But in four out of five criminal cases  sentences fall within or above the guideline range  unless the government specifically requests a lighter punishment  In Mr  Manafort s case  prosecutors recommended no specific punishment  but said the range of 19 to 24 years had been rightly calculated Rachel E  Barkow  a former member of the United States Sentencing Commission  said she had expected Mr  Manafort s punishment to fall below the guidelines  In fraud cases  the recommended penalty can skyrocket depending on the amount of money involved  she said  leading many judges to opt for a lighter sentence ImageMr  Manafort s lawyers played on Judge Ellis s distaste for special counsels  insisting that their client had been unfairly pursued by prosecutors CreditErik S Lesser EPA  via ShutterstockBut Judge Ellis cut the punishment far more drastically than she expected  said Ms  Barkow  a law professor at New York University Judge Ellis said the guidelines for Mr  Manafort s crimes were distorted by a 2017 decision by the Justice Department that increased the recommended punishment for failing to disclose a foreign bank account  which was one of eight counts Mr  Manafort was convicted of after a lengthy jury trial in his courtroom  He also noted that he had sentenced another defendant who had hidden  200 million in overseas accounts and evaded  18 million in taxes to only seven months in prison  plus restitution Greg D  Andres  the lead prosecutor on the case  argued that Mr  Manafort was different because the jury had found him guilty not only of hiding his wealth and evading  6 million in taxes  but also of deceiving banks to obtain millions of dollars in loans  The two bank fraud counts were the most serious charges he was convicted of  each carrying a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison Mr  Andres also urged Judge Ellis to take the broader picture of Mr  Manafort s behavior into account  including the crimes he admitted to as part of his plea agreement in a related case in Washington  Mr  Manafort acknowledged he was guilty of 10 other felonies on which the Virginia jury had deadlocked 11 to 1  including several more counts of bank fraud But Judge Ellis seemed to see Mr  Manafort s case as more strictly about tax evasion  He noted that one fraudulent loan application was never actually approved  and questioned whether Mr  Manafort had in fact intended to cause that bank a loss when he lied to get another loan   I don t know that there s any other way to defraud a bank and not intend it to lose the money   Mr  Andres replied Carl Tobias  a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law  said Judge Ellis s sentence seemed strangely light  especially given that the judge denied every objection raised by Mr  Manafort s lawyers to the sentencing guidelines   He refuted all of the arguments of the defense  yet ultimately ruled very much in favor of their client   Mr  Tobias said He was also struck  he said  by the judge s praise of Mr  Manafort s character   He s lived an otherwise blameless life   Judge Ellis said of a man who acknowledged orchestrating a sophisticated financial fraud scheme that lasted a decade   And he s also earned the admiration of a number of people  To the very end  Judge Ellis showed his distaste for special counsels  He said the office of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  had the authority to prosecute Mr  Manafort  but  that doesn t mean that I decided the wisdom or appropriateness of delegating to special prosecutors broad powers   Judge Ellis cut off a prosecutor as he tried to explain the special counsel s position on the appropriate fine for Mr  Manafort  admonishing   That s the government s position  I don t want to hear special counsel  The defense has played on the judge s sentiments  insisting that Mr  Manafort has been relentlessly pursued for garden variety crimes only because of his importance to the special counsel s inquiry into Russian interference in 2016 presidential election  On Thursday  Kevin Downing  Mr  Manafort s lead lawyer  took up that refrain again  repeatedly saying that a local United States attorney s office would have handled the case differently In federal court in Washington  where Judge Amy Berman Jackson will sentence Mr  Manafort next week on two conspiracy charges  that strategy has been noticeably less effective Some legal experts suggested that Mr  Mueller s team might respond to Judge Ellis s decision by asking Judge Jackson for a specific sentence on the two conspiracy charges  which each carry a maximum penalty of five years But few expect her to be influenced by the Virginia judge s decision   It s not her job to use her sentence as a moment to correct what she thinks went wrong in this case   Ms  Barkow said One of the biggest issues remaining for Mr  Manafort is whether he will be allowed to serve out his two sentences simultaneously  Prosecutors have taken no stand on that so far  but indicated in a sentencing memorandum that they might do so after Judge Ellis s decision

WASHINGTON   Joe Biden isn t a presidential candidate yet  But with two key rivals already getting out of the way  the former vice president has more space to court voters who could help him claim the Democratic nomination Ohio Sen  Sherrod Brown said Thursday he wouldn t run for president  following an announcement earlier this week from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that he would also sit out 2020 Both men have vastly different political profiles  Brown has deep connections to blue collar  union friendly voters in the Midwest while Bloomberg saw his path to the nomination run through centrists uncomfortable with the party s move to the left  But together  their decisions could give Biden a greater opportunity to appeal to the middle America voters who sided with President Donald Trump in 2016 and could be crucial to Democratic hopes of winning back the White House  I think it certainly creates a whole new constituency for the vice president that might have been split otherwise   California Sen  Dianne Feinstein  who has vowed to support Biden if he runs  said soon after Brown s announcement   So  that s good  Chris Coons  elected in 2010 to fill the Delaware Senate seat Biden occupied for 36 years  said Brown s decision not to run  absolutely  strengthened the former vice president s case Brown  comes from and connects to the heartland in a remarkable way  He s a real guy   Coons said  likening his appeal to Biden s Bloomberg s aides said their internal polling suggested his path to the Democratic nomination was narrow  particularly if Biden   who shares some of Bloomberg s moderate positions   decides to run  Brown  in contrast  denied that the former vice president had any effect on his choice to opt out of the primary  His getting in or out had zero impact on this   the 66 year old senator said of Biden  Brown told reporters that he and Biden talk  from time to time  but had last connected before his Senate re election win in November   when he was in Ohio campaigning with me or for me  Biden spokesman Bill Russo declined to comment on either Bloomberg or Brown s decisions against running in 2020 Of course  if Brown had sought the presidency  he would have faced a steep challenge in climbing ahead from the back of the pack in a field with a dozen candidates already declared Biden and Vermont Sen  Bernie Sanders consistently lead in early surveys of the 2020 Democratic field  and former Texas Rep  Beto O Rourke could shake up the race if he decides to run  Brown s departure also provides a possible boost to Sanders  given their shared distaste for free trade deals and vocal criticism of Wall Street Although Brown leans further left on policy than Bloomberg or Biden   especially when it comes to trade  the senator and former vice president have a parallel appeal to working class voters who fled their party for Trump Biden s ties to his hardscrabble hometown of Scranton  Pennsylvania  have made him a compelling messenger for the plight of blue collar workers whose jobs and livelihoods remain under threat by globalization and outsourcing  His role in an Obama administration that poured billions of dollars into rescuing the U S  auto industry from the 2008 financial crisis also gives him a unique opportunity to connect with Midwestern voters  It s a mantle that is open to be grabbed by people who are willing to talk to these voters in an authentic way  in sharing their frustrations   said Tom Russell  a Wisconsin based Democratic strategist who aided the party s successful effort to topple GOP Gov  Scott Walker in 2018  Biden has a history of being able to do that   Russell said  though he added that Brown s absence from the race creates potential advantages for O Rourke  who has elements of the more centrist profile that Biden and Bloomberg would bring  as well as for Sanders  Brown  was Bernie without some of the Bernie baggage   Russell said Still  Biden will have to confront several vulnerabilities  He is famously prone to gaffes and angered some in the LGBT community last week when he called Vice President Mike Pence a  decent guy  The decades in public life that he often portrays as an asset also carries challenges  The Washington Post  for instance  reported on Thursday that Biden opposed bussing children in the mid 1970s as schools sought to further integrate classrooms  Russo said Biden is a longtime civil rights advocate who supports equal housing  education and job opportunities  But such comments from decades ago could seem tone deaf in a Democratic primary heralded for its historic diversity Ultimately  Democrats are weighing how to keep their grip on progressives without alienating Midwestern voters  Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said Brown has proved that s possible by winning over some voters in his battleground home state in 2018 who backed Trump in 2016  Any candidate can  succeed in Ohio  if they are focused on the right issues  and if they come across as someone who will fight for the everyday Ohio worker   Pepper said   Certainly  Joe Biden is somebody I think would have a very good chance of beating Trump in Ohio  But I m quick to say I don t think other candidates couldn t do the same thing     Associated Press writers Tom Beaumont in Des Moines  Iowa  and Julie Pace in Washington contributed to this report 
CARACAS  Venezuela   The Latest on the political crisis in Venezuela  all times local  1 p m Trump administration officials say there are no U S  plans to intervene militarily in the crisis in Venezuela  That s despite the fact that President Donald Trump and others have repeatedly said all options on are on the table to support the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro The special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams and director of the U S  Agency for International Development Mark Green told Congress that the administration is promoting a peaceful political transition in Venezuela  Both said their instructions were to work only to that end Abrams said the administration was wholly focused on exerting diplomatic and economic pressure on Maduro through sanctions  He said more sanctions would soon be announced and foreign banks may be targeted if they are found to be assisting Maduro in hiding state assets Abrams and Green testified Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee The U S  is among more than 50 governments to recognize Juan Guaido as interim president  arguing that Maduro s re election last year was illegitimate    8 35 a m The European Union said it was disappointed that Venezuela s government has ordered the German ambassador to leave the country after he expressed support for opposition leader Juan Guaido European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said Thursday that the EU wants to continue its dialogue with all political forces in the country  Despite the tense and complex political context  the EU has been keen to maintain lines of communication with all key parties including the government   Kocijancic said   In that respect  the EU hopes that this decision can be reconsidered  The German ambassador and other diplomats greeted Guaido when he returned to Venezuela on Monday   a gesture the Venezuelan government condemned    8 a m Germany s foreign minister says the presence of foreign diplomats at the Caracas airport on Monday helped prevent the arrest of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido Heiko Maas said Thursday he expressly asked Germany s ambassador to Venezuela  Daniel Kriener  to join other envoys at the airport He told reporters in Berlin on that  there was information that he  Guaido  was meant to be arrested there  and I think the presence of various ambassadors contributed to helping prevent this arrest  On Wednesday  the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced it was giving Kriener 48 hours to leave the country  a move seen as a response to Germany s support for Guaido 
WASHINGTON   The House will vote on Friday on the Democrats  signature piece of legislation  a sprawling compendium of ballot access  campaign finance transparency and anti corruption proposals devised to restore public trust in government The sweeping measure   as much a campaign platform as an actual piece of legislation   is intended to show the voters who catapulted Democrats into the majority that they are following through on their campaign pledges  The bill  nearly 700 pages  aims to dismantle barriers to voting  end big money in politics and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials  This is about instilling the confidence of the American people in the political process  in what happens in government  that it is the people s interests that are being served   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said But Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill   called the For the People Act or H R  1  to underscore its primacy   and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  has branded it the  Democrat Politician Protection Act  in weekly speeches  The House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  produced his own video to define the bill  This is a terrible proposal   Mr  McConnell said on Wednesday   This is a solution in search of a problem  What it really is is a bill designed to make it more likely that Democrats win more often  Democrats are standing by their legislative handiwork  Now they have to sell it  It s going to become  I believe  a marker of what the Democratic brand is   Representative John Sarbanes  Democrat of Maryland and the lead sponsor of the legislation  said in an interview   We stand for reform  we stand for democracy  we stand for cleaning up our politics  ImageSenator Mitch McConnell  the majority leader  has called the proposal  terrible  and  a solution in search of a problem  CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesSo what is in H R  1 Campaign finance transparencySome of the most debated provisions are intended to disclose who is paying for online political ads and financing so called dark money groups  The Disclose Act  part of the bill  would require super PACs and nonprofit organizations that spend money in elections to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than  10 000  Democrats say such disclosure is broadly popular with voters in both parties  Congress cannot meaningfully address the nation s significant challenges without first recognizing and acknowledging the undue influence of special interests in our politics   said Representative Abigail Spanberger  Democrat of Virginia Some of those provisions  however  have drawn criticism from both conservative and liberal groups that argue the language is overly broad and would infringe on First Amendment rights Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana  the minority whip  said the legislation would turn the Federal Election Commission  into a  speech czar  with the power to enforce Democrats  vague definition of  campaign related speech    The American Civil Liberties Union has urged members to oppose the legislation  Communications that refer to a candidate in the context of an important public policy issue may have nothing to do with supporting or opposing that candidate s election  and yet that speech would trigger disclosure   the organization said in a 13 page letter laying out its concerns The legislation would establish a six to one matching system for donations of up to  200 to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high dollar contributions  That system would be funded by an additional fine on corporations found to have broken the law  Republicans call that welfare for politicians  Make no bones about it  No matter how they try to move a shell game around  the cost will be borne as another mandatory spending program in Washington   said Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois  the ranking Republican on the House Administration Committee Eliminating barriers to votingThe legislation seeks to make it easier to vote  It would designate Election Day as a federal employment holiday and automatically register citizens to vote  restore voting rights to those who have served felony sentences and encourage same day voter registration ImageVoters in Franklin County  Ohio  last year  The legislation aims to prohibit voter roll purges like those that have been challenged in Ohio and Texas CreditJohn Minchillo Associated PressIt also would prohibit voter roll purges  a technique employed by states to prune outdated registrations but one that voting rights advocates say has been used to disenfranchise eligible voters  especially minorities  Such purges have been subjected to court challenges in Ohio and Texas  Voting is crucial  and I don t give a damn how you think about it   Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  said in a fiery hearing on the legislation   I want to be clear  that when they look back on this moment 200 years from now  there are those of us who stood up and said   We will defend the right to vote   Republicans have expressed concern about allowing felons to vote  although in most states  felons can regain their voting rights after they are released  as in Massachusetts and Hawaii   after they complete their parole  as in Colorado and Connecticut  or when they are no longer on parole or probation  as in New Jersey and Texas   Not only is this dangerous  it s unconstitutional   Mr  McCarthy said in his video attacking the legislation Mr  McConnell threw cold water on the proposal to make Election Day a federal holiday  What affects turnout more than anything else is interest and competition   he said   We got a lot of federal holidays in America  I personally don t see any point in having more  Holding the president and other officials accountableThe legislation also provides House Democrats with another opportunity to jab at President Trump with a series of ethics law changes that cut to the heart of some of the controversies bedeviling Mr  Trump It would require presidents and vice presidents  as well as candidates for the nation s highest offices  to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns   Mr  Trump has released none   and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures  Mr  Trump s inaugural committee  which raised a record  107 million and spent lavishly  is  being investigated by prosecutors in New York Asked whether he would support the measure that requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns  Mr  McConnell remained impassive   We ll be happy to look at it  
JERUSALEM   The Palestinian leadership is urging the international community to boycott the newly created U S  Embassy unit that will handle relations with Palestinians Palestinian official Saeb Erekat issued a statement Thursday calling upon the diplomatic community  not to engage in any kind of formal relationship or collaboration  with the new Palestinian affairs unit  which will take over the responsibilities of the shuttered U S  consulate The U S  move to close the consulate earlier this week was the latest decision from the Trump administration to infuriate the Palestinians  who view the closure as a  downgrade  and  new assault  on the prospect of a U S  brokered solution to the conflict The unit will grant ambassador David Friedman  a staunch supporter of the Israeli West Bank settler movement  authority over U S  relations with the Palestinians 
Immigrant rights advocates and organizers protesting the Trump administration s policies celebrated a victory this week after JPMorgan Chase   Company said it would no longer finance private operators of prisons and detention centers As the administration has stepped up efforts to detain undocumented migrants  privately run prisons have become the government s default detention centers for them  despite reports questioning the facilities  safety  In addition to securing lucrative government contracts  these private companies have also borrowed money from large banks A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase   Company  Andrew Gray  said on Tuesday the company had  a robust and well established process to evaluate the sectors that we serve   As part of this process   he said   we will no longer bank the private prison industry  Mr  Gray did not immediately respond to a question about whether the decision was related to public pressure Last year  two of the country s largest private prison companies  CoreCivic and GEO Group  borrowed about  1 8 billion from several banks  including JPMorgan Chase  Matthew Toole  deals intelligence director at Refinitiv  said on Wednesday  Prison finance represents a small portion of the bank s overall business  according to Reuters While facilities operated by private companies house about 9 percent of the country s prison population  they hold about three quarters of immigrant detainees Ana Maria Archila is the co executive director for the Center for Popular Democracy  a national network of community organizations and individuals that has organized public protests at the bank s headquarters  at annual meetings and outside the bank s chief executive s home in Manhattan In an interview on Tuesday  she said the bank became a focus for its role in profiting from  the caging of humans   which she described as a  morally bankrupt act   I am reminded that when we dare to protest  even when it seems impossible  that we actually lift up the veil on things that were not visible   said Ms  Archila Ms  Archila said the protests had been part of a broader effort by activists to call out corporate entities who they see as  legitimizing  the Trump administration s policies  including the aggressive enforcement of immigration policies and the forcible separation of immigrant children from their parents at the border ImageA CoreCivic facility in Phoenix in 2018 CreditGabriella Angotti Jones The New York TimesWhile testifying to Congress on Wednesday  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  was defiant in the face of criticism over the department s treatment of migrant families at the border  especially over the separation of children from their parents  Ms  Nielsen also encouraged lawmakers to pass legislation that would allow the indefinite detention of families and to more easily turn back claims of asylum by migrants from Central America Representatives for the prison companies expressed frustration with JPMorgan Chase s decision and what they saw as a weaponization of political will  JP Morgan has served an important role in creating better conditions for inmates entrusted in our care   Rodney E  King  a spokesman for CoreCivic  said on Tuesday Mr  King added that the company s immigration facilities did not provide housing for children who weren t under the supervision of a parent  These divestment efforts are politically motivated and based on a deliberate mischaracterization of our role as a long standing service provider to the government   he said Emily Covington  a spokeswoman for the GEO Group  which operates dozens of about 130 dozens of correctional  detention and community re entry sites in the United States  said Tuesday that the company had never managed facilities that house unaccompanied minors  including those who may have been separated from their parents Several activists and politicians embraced the news  including New York City s comptroller  Scott M  Stringer  who called the development  huge  On Valentine s Day this year  an immigrants rights group  Make the Road New York  sent a mariachi band and protesters with  Break Up With Prisons  signs to the townhouse of JPMorgan Chase   Company s chief executive  Jamie Dimon  If we come together and are diligent   Javier H  Valdés  the group s co executive director  said Tuesday  to  build strong coalitions and work with powerful allies  we can actually win and help shift the narrative of enforcement in this country  Ms  Archila  one of several protesters arrested on charges of blocking the entrance to the bank s headquarters in Manhattan in May 2017  said targeting the financial services industry was a new frontier in the campaign for immigrants  rights  In some ways  the Trump era is one of fighting against incredible odds  to protect our communities  to protect ourselves  to protect each other   she said 
SAN DIEGO   The U S  government kept a database on journalists  activists  organizers and  instigators  during an investigation into last year s migrant caravan  infuriating civil liberties and media groups who called it a blatant violation of free speech rights U S  Customs and Border Protection compiled information on dozens of people that included passport and social media photos  dates of birth  personal information and their suspected role in the caravan  Some of the people on the list were denied entry into Mexico and had their passports flagged or visas revoked On Thursday  officials said the department s independent watchdog was looking into the database  and stressed that journalists were not targeted based on their occupation or reporting  CBP has policies in place that prohibit discrimination against arriving travelers and has specific provisions regarding encounters with journalists   said Andrew Meehan  assistant commissioner of public affairs The database was revealed Wednesday by the San Diego TV station KNSD  People listed in the documents provided to the station included 10 journalists  many of whom are U S  citizens  and an American attorney  There were several dozen people in all on the list  including many labeled as  instigators  The intelligence gathering efforts were done as part of  Operation Secure Line   which was designed to monitor the caravan of thousands of people who began making their way north from Central America last year to seek asylum in the United States The government compiled the database at a time when the caravan was attracting considerable attention in the White House around the midterm elections  with President Trump repeatedly tweeting about the group Customs and Border Protection officials said extra security was implemented after a breach of a border wall in San Diego on Nov  25 in a violent confrontation between caravan members and border agents  The confrontation closed the nation s busiest border crossing for five hours on Thanksgiving weekend Officials said it was protocol to follow up on such incidents to collect evidence  and determine whether the event was orchestrated Such  criminal events     involving assaults on law enforcement and a risk to public safety  are routinely monitored and investigated by authorities   according to a statement from Customs and Border Protection  CBP will continue to maintain a high standard of accountability and transparency with the media and public   Meehan said Lawyers and immigrant rights groups were going back and forth across the U S  Mexico late last year to help thousands of people who arrived at the border manage a complicated clogged asylum process and to help provide humanitarian aid as conditions worsened and illness spread  Journalists from several news organizations were also there to chronicle the story Bing Guan  a freelance journalist from New York and student at the International Center of Photography  said he and a colleague were stopped by U S  agents while returning from Tijuana in December  A plainclothes agent who didn t identify his agency showed Guan a multi page document with dozens of photos and asked him to identify people in the images  The agent then asked Guan to show him the photos he had taken in Tijuana Guan said the report of the dossiers confirmed the long held suspicions he and other journalists had  It s sort of a weird combination of paranoia and pride   Guan said   Paranoia because our own government is conducting these intelligence gathering tactics and these patterns of harassment in order to deter journalists from doing their jobs  but also a little bit of pride because I feel like I m on the right track   Guan said Two House Democrats asked CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan for any instructions to officers on the 59 people named  an explanation of why they were included and how often they were stopped for additional questioning  The appearance that CBP is targeting journalists  lawyers  and advocates  and particularly those who work on immigration matters or report on border and immigration issues  raises questions about possible misuse of CBP s border search authority and requires oversight to ensure the protection of Americans  legal and constitutional rights   wrote Reps  Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Kathleen Rice of New York  who both serve on the Homeland Security Committee The database was denounced by a variety of groups  including the Committee to Protect Journalists  American Civil Liberties Union  Amnesty International and the Southern Poverty Law Center The database was built at a time of increasingly tense relations between the Trump administration and journalists  with Trump calling some members of the press the  enemy of the people   There has also been an increase in false news stories proliferating on social media on both the left and right The Department of Homeland Security last year sought a contractor to monitor more than 290 000 news sources and social media around the world in several languages  and compile a database of journalists  editors  foreign correspondents and bloggers  DHS officials said the aim was to gather open source information  not unlike alerts the public can set up through email And according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by The Nation  U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  another part of Homeland Security  tracked a series of anti Trump protests in New York City last year  including several that promoted immigrants  rights and one organized by a member of Congress The caravan documents  dated Jan  9  are titled  San Diego Sector Foreign Operations Branch  Migrant Caravan FY 2019  Suspected Organizers  Coordinators  Instigators and Media   According to the San Diego station  the material was used by Homeland Security and other agencies  including some FBI agents One dossier was on Nicole Ramos  the refugee director and attorney for Al Otro Lado  a law center for migrants and refugees in Tijuana  Mexico  It included details such as the kind of car she drives and her mother s name  KNSD TV reported A photographer working for The Associated Press was also on the list The Mexican government  which denied entry to some of the people in the database  said it disapproved of spying and didn t do  illegal surveillance   Mexican officials also said they would ask the U S  to clarify any possible cases of  illegal spying   Mexico welcomes all foreign visitors who  obeying immigration laws  carry out in our territory tourism or professional activities   according to a joint statement from the Foreign Relations Department and the Department of Security and Citizen Protection    Long reported from Washington  Associated Press Writers Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report 
Sarah Isgur Flores  a Republican political operative whose hiring by CNN last month set off an uproar among liberals and several Democratic presidential campaigns  will no longer take on a management role at the network  CNN said on Friday Instead  Ms  Isgur  who was the chief spokeswoman for former Attorney General Jeff Sessions  said she would be an on air political analyst for CNN  a more traditional entry level role for government officials who pursue television careers  She will also occasionally write commentary for the network s website When Ms  Isgur s position   initially described as a  political editor   with a role in coordinating CNN s 2020 campaign coverage   was announced three weeks ago  it set off confusion and frustration inside the cable network and Democratic political circles Several journalists at CNN voiced concerns about the hire  They questioned how a partisan spokeswoman and recent alumna of President Trump s administration  who had stayed on at the Justice Department after Mr  Sessions s departure in November  could be granted a senior journalistic role at the network And representatives of several presidential candidates contacted the Democratic National Committee to ask if CNN  with Ms  Isgur in a senior editing position  could be trusted to cover their campaigns fairly  CNN is set to host a Democratic primary debate in July  the network eventually issued statements saying that Ms  Isgur would not play a role in debates or candidate town halls Ms  Isgur  whose contract at the network goes into effect next week  announced her new position in a Twitter post on Friday   I will go to CNN as a Political Analyst instead   she wrote   Will start next month on air and on line  See y all soon  Reached by email  Ms  Isgur declined to comment further  When Sarah came to us and proposed her role be adjusted to a political analyst instead  we agreed  and we look forward to her starting in that role   a CNN spokeswoman said in a statement CNN has hired reporters from conservative leaning news outlets and organizations  saying that ideological diversity can be a boon to well rounded coverage It is unusual  however  for news networks to place a former government official directly into a role managing other journalists  For instance  George Stephanopoulos  who is now the chief anchor of ABC News  was hired by the network as a partisan member of a Sunday political panel after he left President Bill Clinton s staff in 1996 Ms  Isgur was critical of CNN while working on Republican campaigns  including in 2015  when she complained that the network had excluded her candidate at the time  Carly Fiorina  from participating in a presidential debate  She also attacked one of Ms  Fiorina s rivals for the Republican nomination  Donald J  Trump

WASHINGTON   A federal appeals court in California determined Thursday that a Sri Lankan man who is a member of the Tamil ethnic minority has the right to go before a judge after failing an initial asylum screening The decision could have major implications for those seeking asylum  and could further clog the immigration court system that has a massive backlog  It s also another legal loss for the Trump administration s efforts to restrict immigration  delivered by a three judge panel in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals   the same region Trump has railed against in the past as an  activist court  Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam  46  said he was jailed and tortured for political activity during the civil war between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  according to court documents  He fled the country in 2016  after he was tortured again by intelligence officers  he said in court papers  He crossed the U S  Mexico border on Feb  17  2017 where he was arrested by a Border Patrol agent 25 yards into the U S He requested asylum  But he did not pass his initial screening  a  credible fear  interview where he had to show a well founded fear of persecution  torture or death if he were to return to his home country  The interviews are meant to be inclusive  nearly 90 percent of all asylum seekers pass their initial interview  and then are generally released into the country where they await court proceedings  The number of asylum seekers has ballooned in recent years  and immigration officials say it s in part because migrants know they will be able to live and work in the U S  while their cases play out  That process could take years  in part because the immigration court has a backlog of more than 700 000 cases  In the end  most people do not end up receiving asylum Thuraissigiam said that the agent rejected the claim after conducting only a cursory hearing and refused to hear important context that would bolster his case  He asked for a court hearing to appeal the decision  but was denied it  The American Civil Liberties sued on his behalf The three judge panel in San Francisco agreed Thuraissigiam has a right to go before a judge  It will mean that thousands of current and future noncitizens will not be sent back to potential death without a federal court looking at their case   said Lee Gelernt  deputy director of the ACLU s Immigrants  Rights Project   The historical and practical importance of this ruling cannot be overstated   he said   This decision reaffirms the Constitution s foundational principle that individuals deprived of their liberty must have access to a federal court  The panel noted the Supreme Court hasn t considered the question  The only other court to rule on the issue  the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia  reached a different conclusion  It decided in 2016 that immigrants arrested after just crossing the border were not entitled to a court hearing to challenge deportation

the Trump campaign s hands  And former Gov  John Hickenlooper of Colorado opened his presidential campaign this week by questioning whether  Medicare for all  was  really the right thing  Welcome to the revenge of the moderates Since President Trump s election  an activist liberal wing has taken hold of the Democratic Party  They ve pushed bold economic  health care and environmental proposals  Some have embraced the term  socialist   giving fresh fodder to Republican critics  and denounced the richest Americans and biggest corporations  And they ve dominated the national conversation  from Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in Congress to Senator Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail But now  as the 2020 primary field comes into sharper focus  we re starting to see a resurgence of more moderate  market oriented Democrats  as they try to re exert their power in a party they fear is courting political defeat by veering too far left Mr  Biden  a politician defined by the era of centrist Democratic politics  has his campaign plan nearly in place and seems to be moving toward entering the race in the coming weeks  Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and other congressional moderates  like Representatives Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio  are making noise about launching their own presidential bids Those men  along with several other white male moderates who may enter the race  hope to provide a counterweight to the proposals of the Sanders Warren wing of the party Of course  in one really big way  the liberals have already won by shifting the debate distinctly leftward  The conversation in the Democratic Party is around their ideas  a massive plan to fight climate change  a complete overhaul of the health care system  new taxes on the

happening on Capitol Hill this week with Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota offers perhaps the most high profile test yet of that policy   and how it interacts with the Democrats  new power in Washington For those who haven t been following the issue  here s a quick catch up  Last week  Ms  Omar suggested that pro Israel activists were pushing  for allegiance to a foreign country    a comment that leading Jewish lawmakers said played into the anti Semitic trope of  dual loyalty   They pressured Speaker Nancy Pelosi to introduce a resolution condemning anti Semitism That infuriated a group of younger liberal and minority members  who saw the resolution as unfairly targeting a lawmaker who is not only one of the first Muslim American women in Congress but also a refugee The conflict boiled over in a closed door meeting of House Democrats on Wednesday  What about condemning Islamophobia  demanded the liberal members  What about racism  Homophobia Senators Elizabeth Warren  Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris defended Ms  Omar from the campaign trail  Representative Ayanna Pressley  a freshman Democrat from Massachusetts  said   We need to denounce all forms of hate  There is no hierarchy of hurt  The messy dispute has dominated Congress for the past week  overshadowing a signature Democratic bill  H R  1  designed to send a message about overhauling ethics  lobbying and voting laws  It has also been a boon for Republicans  who have already begun using Ms  Omar as both a symbol of Democratic hypocrisy and a way to give cover for the race baiting  misogynistic remarks of President Trump In an effort to end the uproar  the House today approved a resolution on the oh so bold position of condemning all hate  One Democratic lawmaker told me this week that they just wanted to take the vote and move on as quickly as possible It s not likely to be that easy  Issues of race  gender and immigration dominate our national conversation  Hard to imagine Democrats

WASHINGTON   Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday that the healthy U S  economy and low inflation are allowing the central bank to take a  patient  wait and see approach  on interest rates Speaking at Stanford University  Powell said the Fed is well along in its effort to normalize Fed operations by scaling back the extraordinary efforts it employed to support the economy s recovery from the Great Recession The Fed is trimming its sizable holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities  Officials are discussing a plan for wrapping up the efforts to reduce the central bank s balance sheet later this year  Powell said  adding that the plan s details should be announced soon The Fed s moves to reduce its balance sheet  which hit a peak of  4 5 trillion  are being watched closely by investors The Fed started in October 2017 reducing the balance sheet by allowing some bonds to run off as they matured  The balance sheet is now around  4 trillion  but some investors have worried that the Fed could end up driving long term interest rates higher and harming the economy by going too far in reducing its holdings Some analysts have projected the Fed s balance sheet will end up being around  3 5 trillion  which would be significantly higher than the less than  1 trillion it held before the financial crisis hit in 2008 Powell said the size of the holdings will  prove ample  to meet the Fed s needs of supplying reserves to the banking system  He said  we could be near that level later this year   As we feel our way cautiously to this goal  we will move transparently and predictably in order to minimize needless market disruption   Powell said The Fed is conducting a yearlong review of its procedures as part of its effort to update its operations in areas such as the way it communicates with the public  Powell said One area being examined is whether the Fed should consider altering its inflation target  which is currently a goal of annual price increases of 2 percent  to allow inflation to go above that goal for a time During a question and answer session  Powell said that the yearlong review of Fed policy would cover the unconventional tools the Fed used to bolster the economy such as bond purchases but also look at tools the Fed decided not to use such as the use of negative interest rates to provide more stimulus to the economy  This is the first time we have done this   Powell said of the yearlong review  which will include town hall style meetings and an academic conference   We are looking at a wide range of things  In his appearance  Powell did not specifically discuss the course of rate hikes other than to repeat the  patient  pledge the Fed began using in January to signal that it was planning a prolonged pause in hiking rates this year after boosting them four times in 2018 Some analysts believe the Fed could leave its policy rate unchanged for the entire year and could possibly start cutting rates in 2020 if the economy slows significantly as the effects of the Trump administration tax cuts and a boost in government spending fade The rate hikes last year prompted strong criticism from President Donald Trump  who charged that the rate increases were driving down the stock market In his remarks  Powell said   We live in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions around the world  At the Fed  we are committed to working hard to build and sustain the public s trust  
SEOUL   South Korean President Moon Jae in has replaced his unification minister who played a major role in last year s detente with the North  his office said on Friday  and named a longtime confidant to lead Moon s drive for  a new Korean peninsula  Kim Yeon chul  a pro engagement scholar who heads the state run Korea Institute for National Unification  will replace Cho Myoung gyon pending a confirmation hearing   He s the right man who can actively embody the president s vision for a new Korean peninsula  a new peace and cooperation community  by carrying out the Unification Ministry s main policy tasks without a hitch and implementing inter Korean agreements in a speedy manner   Moon s spokesman told a news briefing The change was part of Moon s largest cabinet reshuffle since taking office in 2017  with new ministers for the interior  land and transportation  culture and sport  oceans and fisheries  science and technology  and small and medium enterprises  The shake up allows incumbent aides to run in parliamentary elections next year  analysts said  and turns a page for an administration facing a sluggish economy and sagging popularity  The removal of Cho  who has yet to say if he will enter politics  comes a week after the second summit between U S  President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to narrow their differences on dismantling the North s nuclear program and U S  willingness to ease sanctions The failed summit was a blow for Moon  who had hoped U S  sanctions relief would boost South North projects including a factory park  tourism zone and railway network Ahead of the Hanoi summit  a rift opened within Moon s administration over how to advance Korean ties without undercutting international sanctions and the alliance with the United States Some top aides  including national security adviser Chung Eui yong  had pushed for the economic projects to go ahead  Cho and other aides favored sticking to Trump s  maximum pressure  campaign to force the North s denuclearization Cho s advocacy of strict sanctions enforcement surprised   and drew complaints from   many officials The appointment of Kim Yeon chul  a staunch backer of Korean reconciliation  may further improve ties with the North  officials said  It could also signal deeper divisions within Moon s government  some analysts said  and fuel U S  concerns that the South may be moving too quickly with the North  Kim  55  is a North Korea studies professor and adviser to a previous administration in which Moon also served More recently  he advised Moon s office on Korean summits before moving to head the think tank affiliated with the Unification Ministry  Kim was a vocal critic of the 2016 decision to close the Kaesong factory after Seoul s then conservative government said the North had diverted wages paid to its workers by South Korean firms to bankroll its weapons programs  A private panel appointed by the Unification Ministry under Moon said there was no evidence to back up that charge  and Kim has since called for the factory to reopen The factory  alongside a railway and tourism project  are important parts of Moon s initiative to build a pan peninsula economic community which he has said will also benefit South Korea s economy   Reporting by Hyonhee Shin  Editing by Darren Schuettler 
Good Thursday morning   Was this email forwarded to you  Sign up here  Big questions over Facebook s privacy pivotFacebook plans to start shifting people toward private messaging and away from the public broadcasting on which its business has been built  Mike Isaac of the NYT reports   Mark Zuckerberg said yesterday that the company  would focus on private and encrypted communications  in which users message mostly smaller groups of people they know     Unlike publicly shared posts that are kept as users  permanent records  the communications could also be deleted after a certain period of time     He said Facebook would achieve the shift partly by integrating Instagram  WhatsApp and Messenger so that users worldwide could easily message one another across the networks    That  Mr  Zuckerberg said  would make Facebook a  living room   rather than a  town square  Facebook s declining public perception  fueled by fake news and data privacy scandals  is driving the shift   Frankly we don t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services   Mr  Zuckerberg said  To grow  and roll out new technologies like its reported cryptocurrency  the company needs to regain trust But plenty of questions remain   What s the business model  Most of the company s current profits come from openly sharing content and displaying targeted ads  which doesn t fit with the privacy push  Mr  Zuckerberg argued that there were  all kinds of different commerce opportunities  available in a shift to privacy  but didn t elaborate   Should its platforms be integrated  It s not clear that users want Instagram  WhatsApp and Messenger to be combined  And Facebook could find itself facing allegations of anti competitive behavior by tying them together   When will it happen  Mr  Zuckerberg had promised to improve Facebook s privacy in the past and then was painfully slow to act   A  Clear History  tool announced last year still hasn t arrived                              Today s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York  and Michael J  de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London                             Huawei sues the U S   citing Constitutional violationsHuawei sued the U S  government yesterday over a ban on government agencies using the Chinese telecom giant s products because they could violate American national security The U S  says Huawei products are a security threat  and could be used by Chinese authorities to spy on telecom networks   though it has yet to produce supporting evidence  Washington has pushed wireless carriers to avoid using the company s equipment  and urged other countries to follow suit The lawsuit will force Washington to show its hand   The U S  Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products   Guo Ping  Huawei s rotating chairman  said in a statement Huawei also claims it s being unfairly singled out in an unconstitutional bill of attainder   where legislation singles out a person or entity for punishment without trial  Mr  Guo said that Congress was acting as  judge  jury and executioner  But the strategy is risky  Its business practices and relationship with Beijing will be put under the microscope  And legal experts say the lawsuit on its own is unlikely to succeed  The Russian cybersecurity

non bank firms will also get an easier ride  A federal oversight panel will scrap the  systemically important financial institution  designation  which subjects non bank firms like insurers and asset managers to intrusive oversight   It s largely symbolic  Only four firms had been labeled systemically important and all have successfully argued to shed that status  This is part of the Trump administration s effort to relax financial regulations imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis  Officials have sided with the banking industry in arguing that Obama era rules stifled lenders  ability to make loans and continue to grow But critics say it s risky  and could lead to a less safe  less transparent financial system  Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets  a financial industry watchdog  told the NYT   The markets are not going to have the full picture  America s trade deficit breaks a recordPresident Trump s aggressive fights over trade are driven by a desire to narrow America s trade deficit  which he sees as a sign of partners taking advantage of the U S  But the gap between imports and exports has actually widened  leaving the U S  with a record trade deficit of  891 3 billion  Jim Tankersley and Ana Swanson of the NYT write    The increase was driven by some factors outside Mr  Trump s control  like a global economic slowdown and the relative strength of the United States dollar  both of which weakened overseas demand for American goods     But the widening gap was also exacerbated by Mr  Trump s  1 5 trillion tax cut   they add   and the trade war he escalated last year     Economists have long warned that Mr  Trump s tax cuts would ultimately exacerbate a trade deficit he has vowed to reduce  as Americans  flush with extra cash  bought more imported goods     By his own metric  the president is failing to right America s global trading relationships  But economists aren t panicking   I d rather live in a country that capital is trying to get into  rather than get out of   Larry Summers  who led the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama  told the NYT   The reason we have a trade deficit is people are investing in America  The E U  wants new Brexit ideas  fastOfficials in Brussels have reportedly asked Prime Minister Theresa May to offer new proposals that would convince British lawmakers to back her Brexit deal within the next 48 hours  the BBC reports  E U  officials said they would work nonstop over the weekend if  acceptable  ideas were received by Friday to break the deadlock  over issues tied to the Irish border  which have been the main sticking point  according to the broadcaster But the U K  has said it already put up  reasonable  proposals to satisfy lawmaker s concerns about being tied to E U  rules   That said  Mrs  May has reportedly outlined steps  to develop technology to keep the Irish border open after Brexit  in the event of no deal  Bloomberg reports  Unsurprisingly  the E U  is pessimistic   There s increasing concern on the European side that any concessions the bloc would be prepared to give wouldn t be sufficient to win a majority in the House of Commons   according to Bloomberg  citing unidentified sources More  Toyota says it might stop manufacturing cars in Britain in the event of a no deal Brexit  And the O E C D  has warned that a no deal departure could

that are sold off in tranches  The regulator  wants to identify the holders of C L O s around the world and assess the risks that investors could pull money from exposed institutions during a severe downturn   the FT writes   Investors in C L O s include banks  investment funds and insurers   Randy Quarles  the chairman of the F S B   told the FT   From a financial stability risk  point of view

WASHINGTON FRANKFURT    Patient  monetary policy   Muted  inflation   Uncertainty  over global trade and government policies that may be undermining the economy Evidence of a world slipping back to an inflation less  slow growth norm   the outlook that prompted the U S  Federal Reserve to halt its interest rate hikes in January   has now forced a broader pivot among major trading nations as governments from Beijing to Ottawa take stock of a decaying outlook In announcing a sharp downgrade of euro zone growth and a surprise move to loosen monetary policy  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Thursday coined what may be the motto of the times   Continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty  Those five words sum up why the ECB pushed back consideration of any rate increase to next year and expanded lending to banks to stave off a credit crunch The action was a response to weak inflation and growth data Following on the heels of the Fed s pause of its tightening cycle  the launch of stimulus in China this week  and a debate over more action by the Bank of Japan  the ECB s latest policy decision completes a dramatic turn from just a year ago when the world seemed in the midst of a synchronized expansion  If anything  the world economy is now throwing off signs that an era of coordinated stagnation may have arrived  Anchored by the long run demographics of aging populations and low productivity  the situation has been aggravated  Draghi and other central bankers have noted  by geopolitical risks like Britain s plan to leave the European Union  and U S  protectionist moves that have begun exacting global costs The ECB   s forecast of overall 1 1 percent growth this year for the 19 EU nations that make up the euro zone is less than half of the 2 4 percent predicted a year ago  U S  growth is expected to slow as well as the impact of President Donald Trump s  1 5 trillion tax cut package as well as federal spending begin to wane  The slowdown of foreign growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed   Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in remarks on Thursday that continued the U S  central bank s shift to what she called  softer  policy That  persistent  weakness  she said  reflects the complex challenges faced by China  which this week marked down its growth forecast for 2019 to a 30 year low of between 6 percent and 6 5 percent  weakness in Germany  and struggles in Japan  all overlaid with the turbulence caused by the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and several of its key economic partners  And it is likely to make it harder for anyone to break out Lower interest rate expectations in Europe mean a likely rise in the U S  dollar  weaker inflation in the United States as imports grow cheaper  and slower U S  growth as the cost of American exports rise on world markets  That will add to uncertainty about the U S  outlook and further limit the Fed s already diminished need to further raise rates  The U S  central bank lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018  signaled as late as December that more hikes were coming  and then backed down in January BROAD UNCERTAINTYThe ECB s U turn added to growing investor angst over a weakening global economy  leading to sharp declines on global equity markets on Thursday  Benchmark U S  and European sovereign debt yields tumbled on the blow to inflation expectations Draghi  echoing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell s comments in January  said it was largely the global environment and political risk that had forced the ECB to change course  The challenges to European growth are  mostly of external source   including Brexit and U S  trade policy  he said   The uncertainty is over how long these will continue affecting the world economy  the euro economy  and confidence more generally  That is a question that has become ever more important to policymakers worldwide as the Trump administration intensified its efforts over the past year to challenge and rearrange the global trading system to the United States  advantage as part of an  America First  policy In effect  ECB officials argue  a broad sense of uncertainty regarding U S  trade policy  Brexit  and other risks has now taken hold and begun to erode the economic outlook more severely the longer it persists Recent studies have begun tallying the narrow costs of things like the tariffs imposed by Trump  with a recent analysis saying the measures imposed so far are taking about  4 5 billion per month directly out of the wallets of American consumers and businesses But the more chronic impact may be the corrosion of confidence in a global recovery that was running full tilt in 2017 and much of 2018  Throughout that time  U S  central bankers spoke optimistically of  tailwinds  they felt would let them continue raising rates  That has given way more recently to disappointing business investment  weaker than expected consumption  and market volatility that took a record  3 8 trillion out of U S  household wealth late last year In Europe  much like in the United States  Draghi noted signs of continued economic health that included ongoing job gains and broad wage growth But they are not proving robust enough to lift growth beyond a very limited range  and the hope now is that the shift by central banks will at least put a floor under the world economy that prevents anything more serious from occurring The ECB s action  Draghi noted  did nothing to right the balance of risks Europe is facing  which remain tilted to the  downside   but only guard against something worse  Our decisions certainly increase resilience of the euro zone economy   he said   Can they address the factors weighing on the euro zone economy  They cannot    Reporting by

Over 2 000 students took us up on our second annual December challenge to  connect what you re learning in school with the world today   and  as you ll see from the work of the winners  below  this year s best were just as insightful and imaginative as last year s Whether the connections these teenagers made were obvious  or whether they were so oblique it s likely no one else has ever made them  what delighted us most was seeing the thinking in action  Many described aha moments  when a work of literature or an event in history was illuminated by something in The Times  whether a Letter to the Editor that helped make sense of  Death of a Salesman   or a Smarter Living piece that  as one student wrote  would have greatly helped Hamlet  handle his anger responsibly  Like last year  when comparisons to the  MeToo movement dominated submissions  the echoes of some of our most pressing issues were everywhere  Students saw parallels to climate change in Plato s  Allegory of the Cave  and Beckett s  Waiting for Godot   but also in a Rachmaninoff concerto and a mathematical problem called the Collatz conjecture  Similarly  the role of apps  social media  Crispr and other technologies in our lives today showed up in submission after submission  as students saw forewarnings in texts like  Frankenstein    Fahrenheit 451    1984  and  Oryx and Crake  But enough introduction  the essays

 A Lack of Respect for the Working Class in America Today   to  Death of a Salesman  CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesAlexa Bolnick  Indian Hills High School  Franklin Lakes  N J    Death of a Salesman  by Arthur Miller and  A Lack of Respect for the Working Class in America Today Last year  reading the play  Death of a Salesman   I couldn t understand why salesman Willy Loman refused to accept his son s desire to perform manual labor for a living  If working on a ranch made him happy  then why couldn t Willy let his son go After reading Daniel Wasik s letter to The New York Times   A Lack of Respect for the Working Class in America Today   I realized that this prejudice against  blue collar  jobs dates back to the beginning of the 20th century  In the 1800s  agriculture dominated the economy  and the average American was a small farmer  However  the Industrial Revolution and development of corporations introduced a slew of new business related jobs  such as marketing  finance  management  and sales  Since these jobs required much less physical work and offered a steady paycheck  millions seized the opportunity  resulting in urbanization and the domination of business over agriculture  Consequently  the average American was no longer a farmer  but a city dweller  transforming the American dream from the picturesque scene of a quaint farm with a white picket fence to one of wealth and materialistic success Americans seem to have forgotten the fact that only a century ago  we would be living on farms  performing manual labor  So much value was placed on the image of the successful businessman  that we have forgotten about our roots  about the people who form the foundation of our success  Working class Americans comprise one third of the population  yet they are looked down upon and treated with disrespect  The common misconception is that  blue collar  jobs are unfulfilling  for people who lack ambition  However  this belief is due to the selfish and materialistic society in which we live  money is not the only consideration when choosing a career  What one individual finds enticing may seem unrewarding to another  but that doesn t make them less of a person Willy Loman cannot accept that both he and his son would be happier performing manual labor because he doesn t want to be viewed as less  He cannot understand his son s preference of a simple life because society values material over emotional success Today  there are too many Willy Lomans in the world  too many people who look down on the working class like they lead subpar lives  They fail to consider that someone needs to perform the hands on work that keeps the country running  As the American economy has grown immensely over the last century  working class Americans have experienced little improvement in their quality of life  Yet  as the backbone of our economy  they should be sharing in that growth  Working class Americans deserve better  it is time for them to receive the respect they deserve Alex Iyer  Geneva School of Boerne  San Antonio  Homer s  The Odyssey  and  As Rich Nations Close the Door on Refugees  Uganda Welcomes Them In literature  we learned that in Homer s epic poem  The Odyssey   Homer uses the tribulations of the hero Odysseus to illustrate the Ancient Grecian custom of xenia  This custom focused on extending hospitality to those who found themselves far from home  As Odysseus navigates the treacherous path back to his own home  he encounters both morally upstanding and malevolent individuals  They range from a charitable princess who offers food and clothing  to an evil Cyclops who attempts to murder the hero and his fellow men  In class  we agreed that Homer employs these contrasting characters to exemplify not only proper  but also poor forms of xenia For the people of its time   The Odyssey  cemented the idea that xenia was fundamental for good character  resulting in hospitality becoming engrained in the fabric of Ancient Grecian society  I saw a parallel to this in a New York Times article called  As Rich Nations Close the Door on Refugees  Uganda Welcomes Them  published on October 28  2018  Similar to the prevalent custom of xenia in Ancient Greece  Uganda has made hosting refugees a national policy  The country is now occupied by up to 1 25 million refugees  many of whom are fleeing the violent unrest of South Sudan The xenia of Homeric times implied a mutually beneficial relationship between host and guest  We see this in Uganda  where villagers share land with South Sudanese refugees  Grateful for this generosity  the refugees gladly help out with farming  carpentry  and even translation  Many Ugandans remember when they themselves had to look to Sudan for sanctuary  During the murderous rampages of Idi Amin and Joseph Kony  the Sudanese provided critical support to Ugandan refugees  These memories are motivating modern day Ugandans to assist refugees  bringing the world a little closer to what xenia strived for over 2 000 years ago Uganda and South Sudan are by no means wealthy utopias  However  xenia was never about the rich blindly giving to the poor  It aspired to foster symbiotic relationships of openness and inclusivity that would endure through time  It s interesting that a quaint Greek ideal from thousands of years ago would find a practical application in Uganda  When Amos Chandiga was asked why he lent two acres of his own land to refugees  he simply responded  They asked me  and I gave it to them   He then patted his chest and said  It comes from here  in my heart   Perhaps this can serve as a lesson to Americans  as we grapple with modernizing our own asylum policies  Teaching us that  whether rich or poor  open borders give way to open hearts Megan Lee  West Windsor Plainsboro High School North  Plainsboro  N J    Harrison Bergeron  by Kurt Vonnegut and  The Curse of Affirmative Action From racial justice to gender discrimination  the struggle towards equality is one that holds undeniable weight and value  However  maintaining an equal and just society requires a careful assessment of the ways in which inclusive efforts can be exclusive at the same time In  The Curse of Affirmative Action   author Bret Stephens argues the flaws of a policy that aims to provide equal opportunities to minority groups in education and employment  Stephens makes light of a recent legal battle  Students Against Fair Admissions vs  Harvard  in which qualified Asian American students were being denied chances of admission for unjustifiable reasons in order to create a racial balance  A systematic preference for minority groups through affirmative action has imposed negative effects on another minority group for which the policy was created   although this measure was initiated with the intention of inclusion  it has the ability to do the exact opposite at the same capacity  Stephens states that   The very people who ordinarily championed affirmative action as a cornerstone of a decent society   had no trouble understanding the other dimension of the policy   an unfair preference for the unqualified  They knew that  affirmative action   whatever its benefits as a form of social engineering  was a synonym for mediocrity  Paralleling the same theme  the short story  Harrison Bergeron  by Kurt Vonnegut describes a future in which absolute equality has become the obsession of society  In order to achieve this  any special quality is eliminated through the use of mental and physical handicaps  Those who are intelligent wear earpieces that transmit disruptive noises  those who are beautiful wear degrading masks  and those who are powerful are held down with bags of lead  While doing so allows for a society where no one is above each other  it is also simultaneously counterintuitive and unfair for every citizen  Mediocre standards are set for every characteristic  and the different talents that each individual possesses is buried in the name of total equality Although the  Harrison Bergeron  is a heavily exaggerated piece of fiction writing while  The Curse of Affirmative Action  was written to denounce a real world policy  both allude to the delicacy of equality  Ensuring that every citizen has the same rights  opportunities  and fair treatment regardless of personal characteristics is essential to creating a society of growth  tolerance  and productivity  However  translating these values into policies that embrace a healthy equitable balance is an undeniable challenge  As we continue to progress towards a more equal and inclusive society  we must consider and revise the ideal environment that allows equality to thrive Jeffrey Liao  Livingston High School  Livingston  N J    The Grapes of Wrath  by John Steinbeck and  The Impossible Choice My Father Had to Make Migration  It is a concept fundamental in nature birds fly south every winter in search of cloudless skies  fish swim away from vast ocean depths to spawn in rivers  dragonflies follow the passage of cold fronts in autumn to reach sun soaked shores Yet for humans  the story is more complicated  In her New York Times op ed  The Impossible Choice My Father Had to Make   Reyna Grande illustrates the profound sacrifices that her father and undocumented migrants like him must make in order to provide a better future for their loved ones  Through her account of her father s journey to America  Grande emphasizes the prejudice and violence perpetrated against immigrants from President Trump s policy that separated thousands of children from their parents to the derogatory term  illegal alien  that recently entered the sociopolitical landscape highlighting the unfortunate reality that  in a nation claiming to be built on the ideals of  liberty  and  justice  for all  a deep undercurrent of xenophobia still plagues American society and needs to be addressed John Steinbeck s classic novel  The Grapes of Wrath   which chronicles the struggles of the Joad family during the Great Depression  documents a similar reality  Due to massive dust storms that erode their property and exacerbate their economic troubles  the Joad family moves westward in search of work  When they reach the haunted promised land of California  however  their hope and optimism quickly wither to ash and dust  Beneath the glimmering façade of opportunities that abound in  the land of the free   the brutal living conditions  poverty  and abuse of workers are quickly exposed  The locals derisively refer to the newcomers as  Okies   and  due to rising concerns of a labor uprising  the aristocratic landowners mistreat their migrant workers and promote exploitative policies to keep them subservient and dependent  This vicious cycle of destitution the faithful becoming faithless  the poor becoming penniless illustrates the subjugation of the marginalized and the erasure of those on the fringes of society Although written nearly a century ago   The Grapes of Wrath  documents a social injustice that mirrors the plight of immigrants in contemporary America  As Grande notes in her op ed  the Trump administration s restrictions on those seeking asylum or legal migration exemplifies the frightening ignorance and monoculturalism of our most powerful political leaders  Just as the migrants in Steinbeck s novel grew despondent as police officers jailed union strikers and burned their makeshift camps to the ground  modern immigrants must endure the painful struggles that arise from discrimination fueled by Trump s divisive policies and hateful rhetoric  As Americans  we must do better  We must recognize and speak out against the systemic injustices that immigrants face to preserve the patchwork quilt of diversity that comprises the social fabric of our country Jack Magner  Flint Hill School  Oakton  Va   Biological feedback loops and homeostasis and  After  MeToo  the Ripple Effect All it takes is a single action to spark innumerable reactions  In the case of Jessica Bennett s  After  MeToo  the Ripple Effect   it is the publishing of a 2017 article in the Times that launches a revolution  changing the treatment and recognition of women for the better  In the case of AP Biology  it is the connection of a ligand to a receptor protein or a drastic change to an organism s environment that sends millions of signals that protect the organism from harm In her article  Bennett aptly describes the systemic suppression of women in their attempts to come forward as a form of  machinery   containing several long standing fail safes designed to ensure that vulnerable members of society remain silent  This phenomenon mirrors that of negative feedback loops in biology  in which a stimulus triggers a biological response designed to keep a biological system at equilibrium  Like an increase in body temperature in order to kill a disease  our male centric society has developed instinctual  often subconscious methods to protect powerful men at the expense of women  leaving them powerless to speak up Conversely  however  the  MeToo movement has thrown a wrench in the once impenetrable machinery of patriarchal society  It has extended beyond the limits and implicit biases of the American legal process  providing an open forum for women to share their own experiences  In opposition to a systemic negative feedback loop  women have created a positive feedback loop  where a single stimulus prompts the increase of a specific biological response  which in turn leads to the creation of more stimulus  In this rendition  women bravely tell their stories  Subsequently  women feel less alienated about their own experiences and men begin to consider how their actions affect women  As a result of that response  more women speak up and step forward  causing the process to begin again  Each woman s story serves as a stimulus for a unique  biochemical cascade  of societal impact  with the internet serving as its technological  signal transduction pathway   MeToo and feedback loops are extremely interconnected  but there is one key difference in the  MeToo movement that makes it so dynamic and revolutionary  In biology  feedback responses are developed slowly and organically over millions of years of evolution  Environments select for these responses  and a species s fitness increases as a result  The  MeToo movement is the exact opposite  attacking the perceived natural order that our environment has selected for at the expense the  fittest  members of society  powerful men  This positive feedback loop does not run in concurrence with the already established negative feedback loop  It instead serves as its foil  aiming to topple the destructive systems for which hyper masculine society has selected for over thousands of years Kylie Magnus  Verona Area High School  Verona  Wis    The End of Men  And the Rise of Women  by Hanna Rosin and  How Same Sex Couples Divide Chores  and What It Reveals About Modern Parenting  Marriage still ain t equal  y all  It ain t equal   These words spoken by former First Lady Michelle Obama depict the vast inequalities in what is supposed to be a two sided affair  It takes two to be married  yet women are still being treated like second class citizens in their own homes  While women have made great strides in the workplace  their quest to  have it all  has been hindered by the increasing amount of housework they still shoulder  This inequality for heterosexual marriages is very different from the equity that homosexual couples have found in their own home lives For my AP Language and Composition class  I read  The End of Men  And the Rise of Women   written by journalist Hanna Rosin  She found that most women  even if they earn the most money in their household or if their husband stays at home  do most of the childcare and housework  A software engineer in the book who is the primary breadwinner was quoted saying   I have to do the same house child care work  as a stay at home mom   AND if I lose my job  my whole family is  expletive    54  This book  while providing a comprehensive view of how heterosexual couples interact and carry out housework and child rearing  does not identify that this system works much differently in same sex marriages  The New York Times article  How Same Sex Couples Divide Chores  and What It Reveals About Modern Parenting   written on May 16  2018 by Claire Cain Miller  analyzes how marriages that do not need to worry about which gender traditionally does certain chores divide housework much more evenly  until they have children  In the article  it was established that partners divide chores based on personal preference  After the couple has children  however  they tend to divide housework based on which partner does more work outside the home  Contrary to this  women in opposite sex marriages who work outside the home can shoulder two to three times more housework and childcare than their husbands This new dynamic  introduced primarily once marriage between same sex couples was legalized in 2015  proves that heterosexual couples do not need to follow the traditional gender roles  especially if one partner works more  In order for heterosexual women to gain any freedom from the housework they are so burdened with  these couples should take notes on the tactics homosexual couples are using  By each partner doing an equitable amount of chores and childcare  based on the amount of work they are doing outside of the home  and completing the chores that they do not mind or know their partner dislikes  a balance can be reached Robert McCoy  Whippany Park High School  Whippany  N J   Gilded Age Mugwumps and  Republicans for Democrats The 2018 midterm elections saw a misrepresented faction of the Republican Party shed its affiliation by supporting Democrats  As illustrated in The New York Times op ed article   Republicans for Democrats   the  Never Trump  movement was galvanized by political moralism  Contemporary conservatives  vehement opposition to Trump resembles Mugwumps  bolt from allegedly corrupt nominee James Blaine to Democrat Grover Cleveland in the 1884 Presidential election  Republican anti Trump attitudes echo those of their nineteenth century counterparts  such as Carl Schulz  who wrote   Our duty to the country is paramount to any duty we may owe to the party  Both groups denounced their party s irredeemable deviation from its fundamental values  Mugwump George William Curtis rejected Blaine on the grounds that his party  formerly representing  political morality and personal liberty   had  sprung from a moral sentiment   The estranged Mugwumps utilized political mobilization to hold the Party to the ideals on which it had been established  Curtis  diagnosis is readopted by contemporary voters like Lynn Schmidt  who  appalled by Trump s incivility  affirmed   I am no longer a Republican if the G O P  is the Party of Trump   Curtis and Schmidt attributed an unfit politician to the Republican Party s departure from ethics  Both movements challenged the integrity of their Party as a means of reformation Mugwumps and Never Trumpers share the desire to preserve honesty in democracy  Mugwumps vocally rejected Blaine  recognizing the regressive effects of embracing an immoral candidate  In 1881  Schulz suggested that Blaine s election would prompt an unprecedented descent of the government  into a depth of demoralization and corruption   By rejecting Blaine  Mugwumps aimed to fulfill a civic duty to maintain governmental virtue  Schulz s alarm is mirrored by Never Trump Republicans like Mary Beth Hunt  who reluctantly supported Democratic candidates on the basis that  under Trump   we are watching the demise of our democracy   Both sentiments identified party switching as a measure to avoid the Republic s plunge into immorality The parallels in the Mugwump and Never Trump movements demonstrate the significance of adhering to a strict moral standard  despite extreme partisan divides  Developing in atmospheres of distinct political polarization   residual disaccord from the Civil War and partisan rifts following the controversial election of Donald Trump   both groups were subjected to scathing criticism from Republican loyalists  Nonetheless  they wielded significant influence  historians attribute Cleveland s victory over Blaine to the pivotal Mugwump presence in New York  and today s political analysts attribute the new majority Democrat House to voters in previously Republican strongholds turning to Democratic candidates  The results of the 2018 midterms show political moralism as a counterweight to party fealty  and modern day mugwumpery in full force Connor Stevens  Sunset High School  Portland  Ore    Fahrenheit 451  by Ray Bradbury and  How Egypt Crowdsources Censorship How can you control ideas  In today s world  you scroll through feeds  finding any information available  government trade deals  local restaurants  movies  and TV shows  We are in an age where the power to find any fact  answer or piece of information that floats into question is available anywhere  If this privilege was stripped by a bodying government  how would freedom of information change The theme of censorship is the template for Ray Bradbury s novel   Fahrenheit 451  where the dystopian society has banned books and firemen burn down houses  Citizens in this society fall into a loop of routine and empty beliefs where they ve been force fed nonsensical information by the government  Bradbury describes the painstaking process Montag makes to find the history of books and through the help of an outside thinker  Clarisse Mcclellan  he rethinks his entire existence as a fireman Though the absurdity of banning books is the basis of the novel  some of the government s restriction on information are apparent today  Specifically  the actions of those in power  In the article headed   How Egypt Crowdsources Censorship  it expresses the government s ban on anything that may contradict the state  its leaders or the religion that is sought out by its very people  Shortly after the impending gas deal between Egypt and Israel  reporters posted an article regarding the government s actions and were immediately instructed to remove the writing from the news site  This intolerance to free speech oppresses the people much like those in Bradbury s novel  Reporter and editor of a weekly Cairo newspaper  Yasmine El Rashidi  said he too  learned to self censor  The approach to self censorship is exactly what Bradbury advises us to avoid  The governance in  Fahrenheit 451  protects their people from offensive information by removing the issue completely while ignoring the casualty of accessible information  Events suspiciously similar to today appear in Bradbury s novel  Montag gets stopped while walking without purpose  Yasmine Rashidi is stopped and questioned by police officers simply for carrying a notebook  These analogous patterns make you wonder  have people lost the right to freedom Both the American and Egyptian countries are built off of the idea of a free democracy and more accurately  a republic  To strip away any information displayed for the public would go against the building blocks of developed society and would neighbor the future characterized by Bradbury  It s obvious to pick out the foolishness of removing the process of self thinking in  Fahrenheit 451   however  today this fiction is seeping its way into existence through the governmental censorship of news reporting If we surrender our right to advantageous knowledge  how can we truly conceive ideas independently Zaria Roller  Verona Area High School  Wis    Things Fall Apart  by Chinua Achebe and  The Boys Are Not All Right Colonial age Nigeria and modern day Western society have more in common than one would think  Although the buzz phrase  toxic masculinity  did not exist at the time Chinua Achebe s  Things Fall Apart  was written  its protagonist  Okonkwo  might as well be the poster boy for it Though the novel focuses primarily on colonization and change  I could not help but think of its theme of masculinity when I read Michael Ian Black s NYT article  The Boys Are Not All Right   In his words  toxic masculinity is responsible for the   brokenness of  America s boys   in the US  men are 3 54 times more likely to commit suicide than women  and 97 4  of mass shootings between 1982 and 2018 were carried out by men Okonkwo fell victim to the unrealistic standards of toxic masculinity throughout Things Fall Apart  he beat his wives  killed a child put under his care  and refused to show affection  all in the name of not appearing weak or effeminate  Ultimately  this behavior caused his tragic fall  He was once considered the greatest warrior alive  by the end of the book  he was reduced to a failure of a man  unable to prevent the Europeans from taking control of his village  This was deeply emasculating for him  as his identity and pride stemmed from his power  and he eventually resorted to hanging himself  Men expressing their emotions and opening up about their struggles was frowned upon then  and still is  something Michael Ian Black aims to change  Okonkwo s struggles  although expressed through a work of fiction  were very real and continue to plague modern society Toxic masculinity squashes men s ability to express themselves  whether that be through emotions  the way they dress  or how they act  Men need not show their abilities through aggression  as Okonkwo believed  other men in his tribe unabashedly proclaimed who they were through music  storytelling  and masquerade ceremonies  And such is the message of Michael Ian Black  affirming to young men that expression and vulnerability are things to be strived towards rather than ashamed of Although it was not Achebe s original intent  I believe he inadvertently makes a case for feminism in  Things Fall Apart  by showing the negative impact of Okonkwo s toxic masculinity  Through the lens of toxic masculinity  the worst thing men can be is like women  crying or spending time on one s appearance is heavily criticized  If gender equality is achieved  there will be no standard for men to be reduced to  We need to take a page out of Michael Ian Black s book and look to feminism to fix the world s broken boys  lest they fall

has produced no mathematical proof for over 80 years  and  Stopping Climate Change Is Hopeless  Let s Do It  The Collatz conjecture is a seemingly simple math problem  It reads   Multiply any counting number by 3 and add 1 when odd  and divide it by 2 when even  and it will eventually reach one   And while this conjecture has been observed to be true  it has never been proven mathematically  Its solution is much more complex than the problem s statement  The same could be said about climate change  Describing the problem is easy  climate change is fueled by an excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  trapping in heat and causing a warming of the planet  However  solving the problem is so much more difficult  As Auden Schendler and Andrew P  Jones write in their article   Stopping Climate Change is Hopeless  Let s do it   reversing climate change will be more difficult than  sending a man to the moon   or even  winning World War II  The Collatz conjecture is famous in the mathematical community  Its apparent simplicity yet monstrous difficulty pulls people in  Experts and laymen alike have tried to solve it and have shared their results for others to continue  The problem has appeared in countless dissertations and journals  Still  it remains unsolved after 82 years  and a discovery of the solution in the near future is highly unlikely  The legendary mathematician Paul Erdos put it simply   Mathematics may not be ready for such problems   It may require the development of new branches and innovations in mathematics to prove the Collatz conjecture Climate change is similar  it may take new branches of science and changes in human behavior to develop the solution  It is a global problem which scientists and politicians must work on together  across nations  sharing their progress amongst each other to continue the fight  It has become apparent that the reversal of climate change is the hardest task that humans have ever faced  so hard that they may never see it realized  It is  not a job with a clear payoff   and yet people devote their lives to it What draws mankind to these impossible problems  whether it be solving the Collatz conjecture or reversing climate change  Fighting for a common cause brings people together  making them part of something greater  Even fighting a  long defeat  can give one a sense of purpose a sense of belonging  There is a beauty in fighting a losing battle  as long as a glimmer of hope remains  And as Schendler and Jones write   If the human species specializes in one thing  it s taking on the

psychology  we learned about a term  choice blindness  Essentially  a person becomes so consumed with their own choice that they fail to see any development or change in the situation that would change their opinion  It s part of a bigger circumstance called the introspection illusion  People tend to be more confident and stubborn than they should be in their choices  we will even go to the extent of defending an argument that s wrong  just because we made it Unfortunately  this is reminiscent of the political climate today  In the article  Why Trump Supporters Don t Mind His Lies  by Daniel A  Efron  it states that Donald Trump made over 2 400 false statements in under 400 days in office  however  his Republican approval ratings are at 82 percent  The excuses people actually believe these falsehoods or they just don t mind them because they re a result of his confidence  nonetheless  I believe it stems from this introspective illusion  Specific to our president  in 2016  voters made a choice and now that that choice may not be as ideal  people still want to believe they were right  This isn t specific to Trump either  In all major issues  there tends to be two sides

celebrities are often asked to show aegyo on television  a young female singer named Kang Jiyoung once incurred much hatred online for refusing to show aegyo on a talk show  Aegyo has long become a characteristic many Korean men expect in women  and even many women concede that it is a quality that women should possess Growing up in such a society  I did not ponder the implications of aegyo

Hard Truth  About Science There s a famous line in German  Translated  it goes   As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams  he discovered that he had been changed into a monstrous

 or dung beetle  or   we don t really know  Metamorphosing  The Metamorphosis  into English has been a translator s quandary for over a century  The German word Kafka uses in place of  bug  is

 But the problem of translation doesn t just stick to the literary world  it very much extends into our own lives through science communication  Science and technical journalists are tasked with the same challenge as literary translators  They need to take dense  jargon filled research articles and clarify them into succinct feature pieces that both catch the eye and stay true to scientific findings  Effectively  they just like Kafka s translators must interpret and innovate to get a text from language A  the scientific world  to language B  the general public   And sometimes

and yourself alone  transports you from the turmoil of the world and creates a space where you can be alone with your thoughts  It can be  an act of slowness   allowing you to process the constant flood of information from behind screens  Or  as Tammy Kim writes in  The Feminist Power of Embroidery   it can be  transgressive in its silence and domesticity  Kim expresses a similar sentiment to Willams  in  The Feminist Power of Embroidery   admitting that while  resistance is necessarily public   there is a corresponding need for time indoors  where  she  can be still and let the mind wander  Sarahi  Verona Area High School  Verona  Wis    Enrique s Journey  by Sonia Nazario and  Trump and the Baby Snatchers Sonia Nazario had written  Enrique s Journey  to depict the realities of immigrants  especially in recent decades  depicting the journey of struggles immigrants go through  such as gangs  bandits  lack of food and water  and trying to avoid border patrol  As  Enrique s Journey  humanizes and brings awareness to the situations of immigrants  President Donald Trump s language tells another standpoint  New York Times author  Charles Blow had written  Trump and the Baby Snatcher   after President Trump enforced families to be separated and incarcerated because Trump viewed them as  unlawful immigrants  and  criminals   therefore  the foul language and actions used by Trump dehumanizes all immigrants who cross the border Annie Sheridan  Marblehead High School  Marblehead  Mass    Frankenstein  by Mary Shelley and  Now Mental Health Patients Can Specify Their Care Before Hallucinations and Voices Overwhelm Them Both pieces regard bioethical issues of their times and unfair treatment given to people because of their differences  The creation of Frankenstein s monster is a great bioethical dilemma because it is be a major scientific discovery but its morality is debatable  The bioethical issue in the article is whether mentally unstable patients should get full control of their treatment The amount of respect that Mr  Singer  profiled in the New York Times article  and the creature from Frankenstein received from others are similar  Mr  Singer  who suffers from bipolar and borderline personality disorder  was locked in a room with a guard at the door for 20 hours after visiting the hospital  Both of them were treated like they were animals that were to be put in cages  Even Mary Shelley  the author of  Frankenstein   wanted to see the creature in anguish When reading  Frankenstein   it can be hard to empathize with the monster because he is just that  a monster  I never felt strong sympathy for him because he acted so inhumane  Surprisingly  the treatment that Mr  Singer received in the NY Times article allowed me to understand how the monster felt Tommy Sherman  Bloomfield Hills High School  Bloomfield Hills  Mich    Waiting for Godot  by Samuel Beckett and  Going Nowhere Fast on Climate  Year After Year In this article  author Paul Bledsoe displays society s lack of action over the past 30 years  from the meager response to the staggering climate reports of the 1980s to the current withdrawal of the US from the Paris Climate Accords  ending his article with another warning about the rapid warming of the planet and the costs to humanity in the near and far future  Like we care Although tempting  to think this increasing disregard of our global problems is merely a modern phenomenon would truly be naive  Societal ignorance is a never ceasing historical habit  which has spread into our literature through the escapist genre  often infused with political allegory In my English class  we recently read the play  Waiting for Godot  by Samuel Beckett  a play originally written in France in 1949  The play follows two characters  Vladimir and Estragon  as they wait for a man named Godot for reasons unknown to the reader  As Vladimir and Estragon wait for Godot  they converse about things they wish to do  hang themselves from a nearby tree  never see each other again  and move from where they are  ultimately ceasing to wait for Godot  However  Vladimir and Estragon severely lack the motivation to take almost any action throughout the play  expressed ironically at the end of Act I when Beckett writes ESTRAGON  Well  shall we go VLADIMIR  Yes  let s go They do not move  Curtain    Beckett s incessant displays of inaction are not only purposeful  but also a satirical stab at the ignorance of the political elite in post WWII France  Although his play was written for another time  Beckett s Waiting for Godot still has relevance today  as the problem of lethargy has surfaced again with respect to global warming Janani Srinivas  West Windsor Plainsboro High School North  Plainsboro  N J   World War II and the Holocaust and  China Is Detaining Muslims in Vast Numbers  The Goal   Transformation    Never Again   that is what we said after World War II  never again would such prejudice corrupt the thoughts of our world   Never Again   was the anthem of the people after the 9 11 attacks  never again would we let ourselves be caught off guard like that ever again   Never Again   is what we say after every single school shooting that has happened over the past decade  never again would we let our schools become war zones  It is funny though  how history keeps on repeating itself  isn t it  Now the situation in China with the Uighur Muslims is no different  yet again are we imprisoning people for being who they were born to be  or who they chose to be  Throughout my education I have learned about the Holocaust in different subjects to varying degrees  In science  we learned about how the Germans used chlorine against the american troops  In language arts  we read the  Diary of Anne Frank  and other books detailing the life of a Jew during this time  And in history  we learned about everything leading up to the War and all the catalysts and warning signs  At the time my peers and I just went through the motions  did the homework and took the tests  Only after reading about the Uighur Muslims did I understand why we were being taught the same unit year after year Valerie Wang and Kisha Yan  Richard Montgomery High School  Bethesda  Md   Newton s Third Law and  Women Will Pay for the Mess of the Kavanaugh Confirmation Newton published his laws of motion in his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy  Not only have these laws been the cornerstones of the field of physics  but they re also applicable to the metaphysical world  Perhaps the most often quoted is Newton s third law  which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction  Simply put  it explains why your knuckles hurt while boxing  or why a tennis ball bounces  Outside of its implications in a classroom setting and its fundamental interpretations  the general principle stands  everything you do will have repercussions  making it crucial to remain tenacious in our words and actions For decades  people have been urged to speak up about sexual assault  yet society still tiptoes around the subject like it is broken glass  The past year has brought momentous change  with pivotal figures such as Christine Blasey Ford  Deborah Ramirez  and Julie Swetnick shedding much needed light on the issue of sexual harassment  Women around the world  realizing that they were not alone  were empowered by the courage of others to share their own stories  sometimes earning justice for the crimes committed against them  Although the rise in such testimonials should have solely been constructive in the treatment of women in society  it has caused unanticipated backlash and damage The article headline   Women Will Pay for the Mess of the Kavanaugh Confirmation   likely shocked readers initially  especially those for whom Ford has become a beacon of inspiration  Yet  reading into the article reveals the author s disheartening  albeit true  conclusion that the women involved  the very people who ought to have benefitted from Ford s testimony  are unfortunately losing just as much as they should have gained  Hence  being equal  but opposite Maxwell T  Wilson

and personality  find themselves in a relationship built not on love but on carnal needs  violence  dominance  and submission  One is delicate  valuing kindness and virtue  The other is aggressive  even animalistic  It works because the former submits to the latter  rationalizing and forgiving abusive behavior American literature buffs might recognize this relationship as that of Tennessee Williams  Stanley and Stella Kowalski  two main characters in  A Streetcar Named Desire   But the pattern of dysfunction also describes another star crossed couple  The United States and China A recent article in The New York Times entitled  China Is a Dangerous Rival  and America Should Treat It Like One  noted that the Chinese are simultaneously one of our greatest trading partners  and one of our greatest strategic enemies  Their ideology is antithetical to ours  they steal our intellectual property and rattle at us a military saber built with our dollars  It seems that just as Stella

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and  China Breaks Silence on Muslim Detention Camps  Calling Them  Humane  I first heard about China s hidden internment camps through a snapchat news story  Located in Xinjiang  these camps hold tens of thousands of Muslims  The Chinese government refers to them as students  bragging on public media about their  generous  living conditions  However  the truth of the situation has been brought to light by various news sources  These Muslims are being brainwashed and stripped of their identities  Chinese officials ignore Islam values like the strict adherence to permitted  halal  foods and dress code  instead detaining Muslims and force feeding them communist propaganda It is shocking to see how individualism was not allowed fifty years ago and are still not allowed today  Reflecting on what happened to my grandparents during the Cultural Revolution  and seeing picture after picture of Muslims reciting laws and being forced to do hard  manual labor  I wondered how it was possible for oppressors to oppress  I realise now that this isn t a simple matter of empathy  Maybe the incentive is more of an absolute power for the communist regime In English class we watched the Ted Talk  The Danger of a Single Story  by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie  She spoke of how one version of what you hear has the power to totally infest your perspective on someone or something  Are these Chinese officials  the ones who are running the Muslim  schools   hearing single stories from the government  Are the Muslims trapped in these camps hearing single stories from these officials  When these shallow  one dimensional stories become somebody s truth  do we start forgetting about putting each other in each other s shoes  regardless of religions or customs

My job  when I am doing it right  is to please no one  I m a press lawyer  I m paid by this newspaper to vet stories before publication Think of me as a story s first and worst reader  doubtful  questioning  blind to subtlety  skeptical of the facts  regularly prodding editors and reporters to do something more or different  And if I have done my job well  many of the subjects of those same stories will be unhappy as well  but for all the reasons we want them to be  We got it right The basic idea of libel law is simple  A publisher can get sued for making a factual statement that proves to be false and hurts a person s reputation  For those of us charged with helping news organizations avoid libel suits  that means we learn to look at the world through the eyes of the person at the center of any tough story  often the bad guy in the tale I am all about the villains in many pieces   the doctor who botched the surgery  the insurance company that shafted its customers  the professor who hit on the student  the greedy industrialist who ground up workers to make a fortune  I try to look for the counternarrative that they could  and their lawyers will  build from the same set of facts  It s a counterintuitive form of reading  It s looking for the innocent explanation or the possibility that what appears to all the rest of the world to be nefarious may in fact just be a mistake made in good faith It s a tricky skill to take into the real world  When the guy at the grocery story with 17 items cuts in front of you in the express line  maybe you don t want to wonder whether he just honestly miscounted  17 can look a lot like 10   Or ponder the possibility that he sincerely thinks he is supposed to be counting food groups  not boxes  Or earnestly gauge the likelihood that he is a devoted father in a rush to get home to a sick and hungry child  Maybe you just want to go with irate and level a  I hope you die  sir  stare But for a libel lawyer  a little sympathy for the villain is almost an occupational requirement  And maybe it wouldn t be a bad idea for all of us in the tribalized  pick your side and stay on it  era we are living in Most Times stories don t take much of a legal lift  or any at all  But my approach was never more tested than in the 2016 campaign  I had been a Times lawyer for a decade and a half by then  Week after week  I was alternatively in the tank for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump  whoever happened to be the piñata on any given day  doing my part to make certain that our coverage was sound I have an old school vision of the First Amendment  that journalists should tell stories straight  that readers can be trusted and that out of that process we as a country will get it right more often than not Libel lawyers don t serve as the fairness police  If anything  they are more like fact cops  Coverage can be wildly unfair and still be true  And that is what matters to the law  Still  as the campaign ended and the Trump administration took hold  and as much as I continued to cling to a blind faith in the power of facts  it was impossible not to get drawn into the white hot debate over coverage in a politicized America It was a debate rippling across our democracy at a time when news operations were facing extraordinary financial challenges  Over the past half decade  The Times and others had reoriented themselves to reader centered journalism  The shift in attitude has been like opening a window after a long winter  Journalism should be done as if the readers mattered But in a divided America there was a risk  too   the risk that we would set our compass by what people wanted rather than giving them the journalism they needed  Among our readers  the appetite for stories that were unflattering to Mr  Trump and the people around him seemed insatiable  There were times  though  when we needed to tell other kinds of stories if we hoped to reflect the world as it was In late November 2016  Scott Shane of The Times s Washington bureau did a profile of Steve Bannon  at that time Mr  Trump s go to aide  It was a well reported piece of journalism done by the book  a profile of a newsmaker that had no ambition beyond letting readers know who this Bannon character was It set readers  hair on fire  Part of it was the digital headline that described Mr  Bannon as  combative  and a  populist  when many readers thought  racist    white supremacist  or  xenophobe  might have done the trick If people wanted to see Mr  Bannon as a menace to America  the facts for getting there were to be found in the profile  But if readers preferred to see Mr  Bannon as an enigmatic figure with a résumé that should have led him anywhere but where he ended up  the article gave that narrative  too  It was discouraging that so many people apparently believed that the time honored journalistic act of telling a story straight had become a problem and that The Times needed instead to take sides and coach readers on what to think Journalism is hard when people feel the failure to take sides is in and of itself a surrender  It is not an easy time to be speaking up for a journalism that follows the facts wherever they lead  even if our readers  or our president  don t want to be taken there By the time the profile of Mr  Bannon ran  the alt right and its enablers had become the masters of trying to silence all the voices they found disagreeable  It was not a model I thought we should emulate  The great risk we face comes not in giving them voice but in taking their worst instincts and making them our own At least that is the free press vision I tried to bring to my legal work  even as the president continued his toxic attacks on the press  But it wasn t always possible to hear the  fake news  drumbeat and shrug  In April 2017  the PR person for a gun control group wrote to us with a strange cheeriness   Just wanted to let you know that the N R A  has released another unhinged video  this time targeting N Y T  Apparently  they re  coming for you   Happy Friday  The video was another release from the National Rifle Association s media outlet  NRATV  featuring its favorite over the top talking head  Dana Loesch  the go to ringmaster for the group s propaganda circus  Wearing a white top offset by the all black background of the NRATV studio  Ms  Loesch spewed out her not quite controlled rage about fake news  directly addressing The New York Times   Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow   she announced   We re going to laser focus on your so called honest pursuit of truth  In short  we re coming for you  Many people at The Times found it chilling and pressed us to respond in some way  All of that was understandable  We have lived through too many death threats to our people  But I questioned whether we really wanted to give the N R A  and its fans the satisfaction of an official response from the company  The First Amendment gives a lot of protection to even nasty speakers  We stood down as a company  We were willing to let the hit piece fade into obscurity I was more than a little surprised  then  to pick up The Times a few months later and find spread across the Sunday Styles section a fairly glowing profile of none other than Dana Loesch  Online  the headline described her as  the National Rifle Association s telegenic warrior   The reporter and Ms  Loesch took what seemed like a lovely trip to the neighborhood shooting range  I think  upon reflection  it spoke well of The Times  Ms  Loesch was a person in the news  and we write about people in the news  not just the people we agree with I never heard whether Ms  Loesch considered the profile fake news  but four weeks later she was once again lighting up the screen at NRATV   literally  A new video showed Ms  Loesch holding up a lighter to a copy of The New York Times   You know  I don t even have to do this   she said   You guys are doing a good enough job burning down your reputations all by yourselves   Lovely But that is how the First Amendment works   thanks to our  profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited  robust and wide open   as Justice William Brennan said in the landmark Times v  Sullivan case  which raised the bar for libel suits against publications  Speakers are allowed to be provocative  colorful  contradictory and wrong It is a beautiful thing  Bizarre some days  but still beautiful RelatedA letter by David McCraw in response to Donald Trump was widely

NEW YORK   Growing up in eastern Honduras  Jose said his father would get drunk and beat him with a horse whip and the flat side of a machete  He said he watched his father  a coffee farmer whose crops succumbed to plague  hit his mother on the head with a pistol  sending her to the hospital for three days At 17  Jose said  he hired a coyote to ferry him to the United States  seeking to escape his home life and violent feuding among his relatives  as well as seek better opportunities for himself and his siblings  He was picked up by border agents  then released pending deportation proceedings After struggling to get a good lawyer  Jose applied at 19 for special protection under a program for young immigrants subjected to childhood mistreatment including abuse  neglect or abandonment  But like a growing number of applicants  his petition hit a series of hurdles  then was denied  Now he is appealing  It s like being stuck not going forward or backwards   said Jose  now 22 and living in New York  He spoke on condition his last name not be used because he is working without a permit and does not want to jeopardize his appeal   You can t advance in life   he said  As President Donald Trump vociferously pushes for a physical barrier across the country s southern border  young people claiming to be eligible for protection under the Special Immigrant Juvenile  SIJ  program increasingly face a less publicized barrier  heightened demands for paperwork Data obtained by Reuters under the Freedom of Information Act shows that the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  has recently ramped up demands for additional documents through  Requests for Evidence  and  Notices of Intent to Deny   which can tie up cases for months   For a graphic on the Special Immigrant Juvenile Program click on  https   tmsnrt rs 2EFeDV7 The program allows immigrants under 21 to apply for permanent residency in the United States if a state court determines that they need protection and that returning to their home countries would be unsafe  Since 2010  about 54 000 applications have been approved In fiscal year 2016  before Trump took office  USCIS issued 347  Requests for Evidence   the data show  A year later  the agency issued 4 153  while the overall number of new applications rose only slightly  Notices of Intent to Deny   one of the last opportunities to submit additional information before a petition is rejected  doubled in fiscal year to 767 in 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 Meanwhile  approvals of special immigrant juvenile status petitions dropped by nearly 60 percent in the 2018 fiscal year compared to a year earlier  to 4 712  while denials increased more than 88 percent  according to federal data USCIS Spokesman Michael Bars said in a statement that the agency evaluates every petition case by case and that requesting additional evidence  cut down on frivolous petitions and applications  reduce waste  and help to improve the integrity and efficiency of the immigration petition process  Immigrant advocates and attorneys have turned to the special protection program as one avenue to offer young migrants who had come from violent pasts a path to legal residency in the United States  Some apply for asylum at the same time But for years critics have seen the youth program and other forms of legal relief for Central Americans  including some asylum protections  as  loopholes  that are too permissive and end up encouraging more migration It s  shockingly easy for any minor that is represented by a lawyer to meet the requirements of the law regardless of whether they have been abused  neglected and abandoned   said Jessica Vaughan from the Center for Immigration Studies  which supports increased immigration restrictions  LOW HANGING FRUIT  Migrant attorneys say the administration is using an administrative back door to curb the program  They say many of the requests for additional evidence are technical   requiring proof  for instance  that a state court s order was issued according to that state s law  These advocates say a large chunk of cases being challenged by the Trump administration are those like Jose s  in which applicants applied between the ages of 18 and 21  and in which the government has challenged the jurisdiction of state family courts in the proceedings  Immigration rights groups have sued the government in California  New York and Washington state over what they say are blanket denials of petitions from that older group  In the California suit  a judge in February issued a preliminary ruling against the administration  saying state courts do have jurisdiction  A ruling is expected soon in New York  and the Washington suit was just filed Tuesday   These post 18 cases are the low hanging fruit   said Maria Odom  the former independent ombudsman for USCIS under President Barack Obama   This is just one piece of  the administration s  overall plan to destroy protections for unaccompanied minors to try to stop the flow  MISSION CREEP Underlying these disputes is a conflict over the purpose of the 1990 law authorizing the youth protection program The law was passed in response to growing concerns about foreign children becoming homeless or orphaned in the United States because of abandonment or abusive family situations  Eligibility was expanded in 2008 under a U S  anti human trafficking law to include kids abandoned by just one parent even if they were being cared for by the other Applications ballooned during the Obama administration following a surge in unaccompanied minors crossing the U S  Mexico border  many from violent countries in Central America  The government received 1 646 applications for the status in fiscal year 2010  in 2018  the number of applications jumped more than thirteenfold   This is not what the original law anticipated   said Vaughan from the Center for Immigration Studies   It was meant for kids who were trafficked   By statute  USCIS is supposed to process applications in six months  but Randi Mandelbaum  who runs a legal clinic at Rutgers Law School that serves immigrant foster kids  said she is handling a dozen cases that have been pending longer than a year  The delays can be painful  she said  Young people  are already very vulnerable and now they can t move on   Mandelbaum said   Their lives are on hold   This story has been refiled to correct the spelling of USCIS spokesman s name in 13th paragraph    Reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York

TUCSON  Ariz    A motel and a monastery are among pop up shelters that have opened in the last six months in Arizona to house a rising number of migrants from Central America entering the United States to seek asylum    In January  Catholic Community Services  CCS  turned to the American Red Cross for cots and blankets to equip the former Benedictine monastery in Tucson  Arizona  as a shelter  said CCS Director of Operations Teresa Cavendish         The monastery has housed more than 1 000 people since it was opened  Cavendish said     These are unprecedented numbers for this time period and this region   she said U S  Border Patrol officials told reporters on Tuesday that there has been a dramatic shift in how migration is happening along the U S  Mexico border  with large numbers of families and unaccompanied children from the northern triangle countries of Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador replacing mostly single adult men from Mexico who typically crossed the border illegally in the past  Apprehensions and people deemed inadmissible at ports of entry along the southwest border reached a record high of more than 76 000 in February  and the majority of those caught were families  according to U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  statistics In recent years  applications for asylum have ballooned as more Central Americans fleeing violence back home turn themselves into authorities to seek protection  according to CBP data The shelters in Arizona are way stations for migrants released by border agents that need a place to stay while they figure out where they can settle in the United States and pursue claims in immigration court Cavendish allowed a Reuters photographer to visit the monastery and a 1970s motel in the Tucson area on condition the photographer not take pictures of the migrants  faces or disclose their identities  Cavendish said the charity feared gangs and others in home countries and the United States might try to extort the migrants or their families if it were known they were in the United States RECORD ARRIVALSFacing an influx of families and legal limits on the time minors can be held  U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  began to release large groups to Arizona charities and churches in October  ICE spokeswoman Yasmeen O Keefe said Adults are outfitted with a monitoring ankle bracelet on a case by case basis when they are held at ICE facilities in Arizona  according to ICE  Migrants are assigned an immigration court near where they will live  They can wait years for their asylum hearing due to a backlog in cases  according to Reuters data Migrants stay at the shelters for a night or two to get a hot meal  a shower  a medical check up and maybe some legal advice  Volunteers help with travel plans  then drop the migrants off at the bus station or airport  They journey on to stay with friends or family in the United States while awaiting court hearings  according to CCS But their prospects for getting asylum are dim CBP Commissioner Kevin  McAleenan said on Tuesday that while approximately 80 percent of people asking for asylum pass initial screening at the border   only about 10 to 20 percent of Central Americans are found to have valid claims at the end of their immigration court process While many migrants fleeing Central America have said they left their home countries to escape poverty  violence and crime  hoping to find a better life in the United States  often those reasons do not meet the high legal bar required to avoid a deportation order The Trump administration is concerned the asylum process is being abused  and has made efforts to curb the number of applications  The Trump administration recently announced that it was aiming to expand a program to send Central American asylum seekers to await U S  court dates in Mexico For photo essay  please click on  https   reut rs 2C7fdcF   Reporting by Nicole Neri in Tucson  Arizona  additional reporting by Andrew Hay and Mica Rosenberg  Editing by Bill Tarrant and Diane Craft

Want the At War newsletter emailed to you  Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Friday The Times recently asked servicewomen and veterans to share stories about their military service for a project planned for today  International Women s Day  I wasn t surprised that we received more than 650 submissions to our reader call out  But reading the dozens of accounts that poured in each day filled me with a renewed sense of appreciation and frustration for these women s service  Too many had to force their way into an institution that has been designed for and upheld by men for generations  Too many were told they didn t belong  And too many felt the physical and mental consequences of disrupting and threatening the male dominated status quo in ways that should have been

SAN DIEGO   A federal judge who ordered that more than 2 700 children be reunited with their parents on Friday expanded his authority to potentially thousands more children who were separated at the border earlier during the Trump administration Dana Sabraw ruled that his authority applies to parents who were separated at the border on or after July 1  2017  Previously  his orders applied only to parents whose children were in government custody on June 26  2018  when he issued his initial decision in the case Sabraw was responding to a report in January by the U S  Health and Human Services Department s internal watchdog that said thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017  which he noted has not been disputed  The department s inspector general said the precise number was unknown The judge will consider the next steps on March 28  The first move may be to identify the separated families  no easy task because the government didn t have an adequate tracking system at the time The administration argued that it would be difficult to identify families  the children were no longer in its custody  and the children would likely be emotionally harmed if they were removed from their current homes Justice Department attorney Scott Stewart told the judge last month it would be a  significant burden  to add families and  blow the case into some other galaxy  after the administration had  done all things to correct the wrong  Sabraw disagreed in his 14 page order  The hallmark of a civilized society is measured by how it treats its people and those within its borders   he wrote   That defendants may have to change course and undertake additional effort to address these issues does not render modification of the class definition unfair  it only serves to underscore the unquestionable importance of the effort and why it is necessary  and worthwhile   Justice Department spokesman Steven Stafford declined to comment on the ruling The American Civil Liberties Union  which sued over the practice of splitting families  welcomed the decision  The court made clear that potentially thousands of children s lives are at stake and that the Trump administration cannot simply ignore the devastation it has caused   ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said The ACLU wouldn t want U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to go to the children s homes  Gelernt said  It would prefer that the government tell them where to find the children Sabraw wrote that identifying separated parents and their children  may be burdensome   but  it clearly can be done  Jallyn Sualog  deputy director of Health and Human Services  Office of Refugee Resettlement  said in court filing that it would take up to eight hours to review each of its 47 083 cases between July 1  2017  and Sabraw s June order  which translates to 100 employees working up to 471 days  Such an assignment would  substantially imperil  operations without a  rapid  dramatic expansion  in staffing The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives  but many are not parents  Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year  49 percent went to parents  41 percent to close relatives like an aunt  uncle  grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives  family friends and others The Health and Human Services inspector general said in January that a  steep increase  in separations began in the summer of 2017  before the administration announced a  zero tolerance  policy on illegal border crossings to criminally prosecute every adult  even if it meant splitting families  Families separated before the policy was introduced across the border in last spring included 281 people in a pilot project in the Border Patrol s El Paso  Texas  sector that ran from July to November of 2017 The lack of a tracking system left the government unable to quickly reunite families when parents finished their criminal cases and  in nearly 500 instances  parents were deported without their children  Sabraw ordered in June that the practice be stopped and that more than 2 700 children in government care be reunited with their parents within 30 days  which has largely been accomplished Jonathan White  who leads the Health and Human Services Department s efforts to reunite migrant children  testified in Congress last month that Sabraw  created a pathway  for the administration to successfully reunite thousands of children with their parents  We could not have affected the reunification of children with their parents in ICE custody absent his providing a way to do that under our steady state authorities   White said 
CARACAS   Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido on Saturday called on citizens nationwide to travel to the capital Caracas for a protest against socialist President Nicolas Maduro  as the country s worst blackout in decades dragged on for a third day Addressing supporters in southwestern Caracas  Guaido   the leader of the opposition run congress who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January   said Maduro s government  has no way to solve the electricity crisis that they themselves created   All of Venezuela  to Caracas   Guaido yelled while standing atop a bridge  without saying when the planned protest would be held   The days ahead will be difficult  thanks to the regime  Activists had scuffled with police and troops ahead of the rally  meant to pressure Maduro amid the blackout  which the governing Socialist Party called an act of U S  sponsored sabotage but opposition critics derided as the result of two decades of mismanagement and corruption Dozens of demonstrators attempted to walk along an avenue in Caracas but were moved onto the sidewalk by police in riot gear  leading them to shout at the officers and push on their riot shields  One woman was sprayed with pepper spray  according to a local broadcaster The power flickered on and off in parts of Caracas on Saturday morning  including the presidential palace of Miraflores  according to Reuters witnesses  Six of the country s 23 states still lacked power as of Saturday afternoon  Socialist Party Vice President Diosdado Cabello said on state television  We re all upset that we ve got no power  no phone service  no water and they want to block us   said Rossmary Nascimiento  45  a nutritionist at the Caracas rally   I want a normal country   At a competing march organized by the Socialist Party to protest what it calls U S  imperialism  Maduro blamed the outages on  electromagnetic and cyber attacks directed from abroad by the empire   The right wing  together with the empire  has stabbed the electricity system  and we are trying to cure it soon   he said Several hundred people gathered at the rally in central Caracas for a march to denounce the crippling U S  oil sanctions aimed at cutting off the Maduro government s funding sources  We re here  we re mobilized  because we re not going to let the gringos take over   said Elbadina Gomez  76  who works for an activist group linked to the Socialist Party  CLINICS IDLEJulio Castro  a doctor and member of a non governmental organization called Doctors For Health  tweeted that a total of 17 people had died during the blackout  including nine deaths in emergency rooms Reuters was unable to independently confirm the deaths or whether they could have resulted from the blackout  The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment Clinics in the sweltering western state of Zulia  which suffers chronic regional blackouts  had scaled back operations after nearly 72 hours without power  We re not offering services and we don t have any patients staying here because the generator is not working   said Chiquinquira Caldera  head of administration at the San Lucas clinic in the city of Maracaibo  as she played a game of Chinese checkers with doctors who were waiting for power to return Venezuela  already suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods  has been mired in a major political crisis since Guaido assumed the interim presidency in January  calling Maduro a usurper following the 2018 election  which Maduro won but was widely considered fraudulent Maduro says Guaido is a puppet of Washington and dismisses his claim to the presidency as an effort by the administration of U S  President Donald Trump to control Venezuela s oil wealth Former mayor and exiled opposition activist Antonio Ledezma on Saturday called on Guaido to seek United Nations intervention in Venezuela by invoking a principle known as  responsibility to protect  The U N  doctrine sometimes referred to as R2P was created to prevent mass killings such as those of Rwanda and Bosnia and places the onus on the international community to protect populations from crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing   President  jguaido   you should  formally request Humanitarian Intervention  applying the concept of R2P  to stop extermination  genocide and destruction of what s left of our country   Ledezma wrote via Twitter At the opposition rally  Guaido said he would not invoke an article of the Venezuelan constitution allowing the congress to authorize foreign military operations within Venezuela  until we have to    Article 187 when the time comes   Guaido said   We need to be in the streets  mobilized  It depends on us  not on anybody else  Trump has said that a  military option  is on the table with regard to Venezuela  but Latin American neighbors have emphatically opposed a U S  intervention as a way of addressing the situation   Reporting by Vivian Sequera

The current focus on North Korea s growing arsenal obscures the fact that the most likely trigger for a nuclear exchange could be the conflict between India and Pakistan  Long among the world s most antagonistic neighbors  the two nations clashed again last week before  fortunately  finding the good sense to de escalate  The latest confrontation  the most serious between the two nations in more than a decade  gave way to more normal pursuits like trade at a border crossing and sporadic cross border shelling But this relative calm is not a solution  As long as India and Pakistan refuse to deal with their core dispute   the future of Kashmir   they face unpredictable  possibly terrifying  consequences The current crisis dates to Feb  14  when a Kashmiri suicide bomber killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary officers in the deadliest attack in three decades in the  divided region that both nations have claimed since partition in 1947  The militant group Jaish e Muhammad  which seeks independence for Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan  took responsibility  While it is on America s list of terrorist organizations and is formally banned in Pakistan  the group has been protected and armed by the Pakistani intelligence service Last week  India sent warplanes into Pakistan for the first time in five decades  Indian officials said they had struck Jaish e Muhammad s  biggest training camp  and killed a  very large number  of militants  although those claims have been called into doubt  Pakistan counterattacked  leading to a dogfight in which at least one Indian jet was shot down and a pilot was captured by the Pakistanis The situation could have easily escalated  given that the two countries have fought three wars over 70 years  maintain a near constant state of military readiness along their border and have little formal government to government dialogue Adding to the volatility  India s prime minister  Narendra Modi  is waging a tough re election campaign in which he has used anti Pakistan talk to fuel Hindu nationalism  With Pakistan s Army most likely shaken by the Indian raid and unwilling to slide into protracted conflict  Prime Minister Imran Khan returned the pilot to India  in what was seen as a good will gesture  called for talks and promised an investigation into the bombing  Mr  Modi took the opportunity to back off further escalation The next confrontation might not end so calmly Pakistan has never seriously cracked down on militant groups that attack India and the Indian controlled part of Kashmir  In recent days  Pakistani authorities said they detained 44 members of various armed groups  including a brother of Masood Azhar  the head of Jaish e Muhammad  and planned to seize assets of militants on the United Nations terrorist list  But Pakistan has rarely followed through on such promises Without international pressure  a long term solution is unlikely  and the threat of nuclear war remains China is a major ally and lender to Pakistan  and if it stopped blocking moves in the United Nations Security Council to add Mr  Azhar to the United Nations terrorist list  it would signal to Pakistan that it has to curb the militant groups While the Clinton  Bush and Obama administrations aggressively worked to ensure that India Pakistan confrontations in 1999  2002 and 2008 did not spiral out of control  the Trump administration has done little but issue a few statements urging restraint  It s hard to see a role as a mediator for Mr  Trump  who has shifted the United States more firmly against Pakistan and toward India  where he has pursued business interests  But the United States needs to get involved  It could help India strengthen its counterterrorism capabilities to prevent future attacks  and it could encourage India to modify its approach to those opposing its rule in Kashmir  which the United Nations and other groups say involves widespread human rights abuses that simply spawn more militants  And while it s good when India and Pakistan decide to walk back from the brink  as they seem to be doing now  the United States should be ready to assist if they cannot A solution to a conflict that touches so many religious and nationalist nerves must ultimately come from within  through talks among India  Pakistan and the people of Kashmir  It s a long shot  and the protagonists have shown no serious interest  but that s the reality nonetheless The two countries have crossed into dangerous territory  with India attacking Pakistan and engaging in aerial duels  The next confrontation  or the one after that  could be far more unthinkable Mired in Crisis  Pakistan Vows to Move Against Militant GroupsMarch 5  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram 
The Labor Department is proposing to expand overtime eligibility to include most salaried workers earning less than about  35 000 a year The new threshold would be substantially higher than the current level of about  23 700  but would cover fewer workers than an Obama administration initiative that was thrown out by a federal judge Under the proposal announced Thursday  most workers earning less than the new threshold must receive time and a half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week The department anticipates that the rule will expand overtime eligibility by just over one million workers  absent an intervention by their employers  such as raising their salaries The proposal will be subject to a 60 day public comment period  and the department expects it to take effect around January  The current threshold was set by the George W  Bush administration in 2004 The Obama administration set the salary threshold at about  47 500 when it put forward a new rule in 2016  But a federal judge in Texas suspended the rule just before it was to take effect  arguing that the administration lacked the authority for such a significant increase  The same judge later invalidated the Obama rule While the Trump administration has appealed the judge s decision  it asked the court to pause the appeal while it prepared a new version of the rule Heidi Shierholz  a former Labor Department chief economist who was involved in the Obama administration s effort  said that the threshold in the new proposal was at the upper end of what she had expected  but that she was still disappointed with the figure  Their analysis of the rule looks similar to what we did   said Ms  Shierholz  now director of policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute   The problem is their own analysis shows millions fewer workers get covered  But Tammy McCutchen  one of the architects of the Bush administration s increase  said she was pleased that the department had set the threshold at about the 20th percentile of earnings for salaried workers in the South   in line with where she and her colleagues had set it in 2004  I think that s what they had to do in light of the Texas court decision   said Ms  McCutchen  a lawyer at the management side firm Littler Mendelson   Anything higher would have been subject to challenge again  Many employers and business groups argued that while the 2004 threshold was in need of an increase  the magnitude of the Obama change was unreasonable Some argued that it would significantly increase costs for employers  who would either have to pay out hundreds of millions more in overtime or raise workers  salaries above the new threshold to avoid paying additional overtime  Many critics also said salaried workers would suffer a loss of status by having to account for their time the way hourly workers do The Obama administration argued that its proposal was modest by historical standards  noting that it would make fewer than 40 percent of salaried workers eligible for overtime pay based on their salaries  far less than the percentage who were eligible in 1975 Even so  it estimated that more than four million workers would gain the right to overtime pay under its rule Other skeptics argued that the change would have little impact because employers would lower the base wage of people who work significant overtime hours  leaving their total pay  including wages and overtime  roughly unchanged More liberal economists largely rejected this analysis and concluded that while base wages might fall somewhat  the increased overtime pay would more than offset the losses Employees who make more than the salary threshold are also eligible for overtime pay if they aren t executives  administrators or professionals   that is  workers who have significant decision making authority  But the Obama administration believed that employers were routinely flouting this so called duties test by labeling rank and file employees as managers  making a high salary threshold more important The Trump administration s original nominee for labor secretary  the fast food executive Andrew F  Puzder  was openly hostile to the Obama overtime rule  But after he withdrew his nomination under a personal controversy  his replacement  Alexander Acosta  struck more of a middle ground At his confirmation hearings in 2017  Mr  Acosta suggested that a reasonable salary threshold would be in the low  30 000s Last year  Mr  Acosta s department held a series of public  listening sessions  to solicit input from employers  business groups and worker advocates on where to set the threshold  Many in the business community echoed his  30 000 plus suggestion  while worker groups tended to favor the Obama threshold  At my confirmation hearings  I committed to an update of the 2004 overtime threshold  and today s proposal would bring common sense  consistency and higher wages to working Americans   Mr  Acosta said in a statement In addition to raising the salary threshold  the Obama administration s approach also required that it rise automatically every three years to keep up with salary increases  The new proposal does not seek to raise the threshold automatically  but suggests that it be updated through a new rule making process every four years 
CARACAS   Venezuela s power supply remained patchy on Friday after the worst blackout in decades paralyzed most of the country  exacerbating hardship for millions of people already suffering from hyperinflation and widespread shortages of basic goods Power went out across the recession stricken country on Thursday afternoon due to a problem at Venezuela s main hydroelectric plant  the government said  calling the event an act of  sabotage  by ideological adversaries Power returned to some parts of the capital of Caracas during the afternoon but quickly cut out again  according to witnesses and local media  threatening to extend what is already the longest blackout under 20 years of socialist leadership Neither Socialist Party officials nor state power company Corpoelec have provided further updates on the situation Opposition leader Juan Guaido  who most Western nations recognize as Venezuela s legitimate head of state  criticized the government for bungling the country s energy supply and said Maduro was the one sabotaging the nation  Sabotage is stealing money from Venezuelans  Sabotage is burning food and medicine  Sabotage is stealing elections   Guaido said on Twitter Humanitarian aid trucks went up in flames last month when Maduro deployed troops at the Colombian border to prevent the opposition from bringing in relief supplies Despite international outcry at Maduro s decision to turn back the aid convoy  Elliott Abrams  U S  President Donald Trump s special representative for Venezuela  on Friday ruled out the use of force to deliver humanitarian assistance Washington  which has led calls for Maduro to step down  pledged on Thursday to  expand the net  of sanctions against Venezuela  including more foreign banks providing financing to the government The United States in January levied crippling oil industry sanctions meant to starve Maduro s government of revenue  China  which together with Moscow backs Maduro  issued a stern warning on Friday to Western nations about the risks in imposing sanctions and interfering in Venezuela  External interference and sanctions will only exacerbate the tense situation   said the Chinese government s top diplomat  State Councillor Wang Yi   There s already enough of such lessons from history  and the same old disastrous road should not be followed  Adding to Venezuela s economic woes  a World Bank arbitration tribunal ruled on Friday that Maduro s government must pay ConocoPhillips more than  8 billion for seizing the oil and gas company s oil assets as part of a wave of nationalizations  Venezuela can still contest the award SOME POWER BACKIt was not immediately clear if the outage has affected oil operations in the OPEC nation  State oil company PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment In the upscale Caracas neighborhood of Los Palos Grandes  several hundred people gathered for an opposition rally where Guaido spoke   Everyone is hoping that with Guaido  the country will go back to being normal   said Yamila Oliveros  a 53 year old architect   That s all a person wants  to live normally  That when I open the tap  water comes out  That when I flip the light switch  the lights come on  The opposition has set protests for Saturday in the capital as it seeks to maintain pressure on Maduro to step down  Venezuela has become mired in a major political crisis since Guaido declared himself the president in January and denounced Maduro as an usurper  Maduro says Guaido is a  puppet  of Washington and dismisses his claim to the presidency as an effort by the Trump administration to control Venezuela s oil wealth Maduro  who was re elected last year in a vote widely viewed as fraudulent  blames Venezuela s economic crisis on a U S  backed campaign to wreck the economy and force him from power  Maduro has consistently attributed major power outages to sabotage by opposition adversaries  without providing evidence  Government officials on Thursday said the massive Guri dam was damaged by a cyber attack  and initially said power would return within three hours  They have not updated their timetable  We will once again defeat this electrical sabotage  We are going to recover this important service for the population   Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said in comments broadcast over state television Thermoelectric plants  which are meant to back up the hydroelectric dam  are operating well below capacity  said Miguel Lara  an electrical engineer who formerly ran a state agency that oversaw the national power grid Some 3 4 million migrants and refugees have left Venezuela amid the crisis  according to the United Nations The U N  refugee agency said on Friday that Venezuelans lodged nearly one quarter of a million asylum applications in 2018 alone  double that of the previous year Maduro s critics say his government has mismanaged the power sector since late socialist leader Hugo Chavez nationalized it in 2007 while setting aside billions of dollars for power projects that were swallowed by corruption Venezuela suffered major blackouts in 2008 and 2013 that affected significant parts of the country  but they were resolved in less than six hours Local power outages continue to be chronic  particularly in the sweltering western state of Zulia where residents complain of days without power or with limited electricity and voltage fluctuations that damage appliances   Reporting by Vivian Sequera  Brian Ellsworth and Corina Pons  Editing by Daniel Flynn and Alistair Bell 
NEW YORK   A U S  Appeals Court ruled on Thursday that immigrants ordered deported by U S  authorities in a sped up process have a right to take their case to a U S  judge  giving them another avenue to challenge their removal from the United States The ruling allows immigrants subject to  expedited removal  to have their deportation reviewed in federal court  potentially frustrating efforts by the Trump administration to deport people quickly who have crossed the U S  Mexico border illegally   This decision reaffirms the Constitution s foundational principle that individuals deprived of their liberty must have access to a federal court   said Lee Gelernt  an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union  who argued the appeal  A spokesman for the Department of Justice declined to comment U S  immigration law allows authorities to use  expedited removals  to deport recent arrivals detained within 100 miles of the border  In 2016  the Department for Homeland Security carried out 141 000 expedited removals  according to the opinion If the migrant can show they have a credible fear of persecution in their home country  they can remain in the United States to seek asylum If authorities deny a claim of credible fear  the decision can be appealed to an immigration judge  who is not part of the judicial branch but an employee of the Department of Justice  Several courts have ruled that the law does not permit a challenge in federal courts The Appeals Court ruled that the U S  Constitution guaranteed the asylum seeker could challenge their detention in a federal court  even if they were in the expedited removal process Stephen Vladeck  a professor at the University of Texas School of Law  said the ruling could slow the process of deportations  but the extent of the impact depended on the willingness of federal judges to stay removals The case stems from a lawsuit brought by Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam  who was detained near the San Ysidro port of entry in California in 2017  U S  asylum agents found he did not have a credible fear of being returned to his native Sri Lanka  where he is a member of the Tamil ethnic minority  according to the opinion  He said that in 2104 Sri Lankan government intelligence officers kidnapped him  beat him and threatened to kill him for his political activities An immigration judge upheld the credible fear finding  and in 2018  Thuraissigiam sued in federal court  alleging the process violated his constitutional rights   Reporting by Tom Hals in New York  Editing by James Dalgleish 
BEIJING   China and the United States are still working day and night to achieve a trade deal that matches the interests of both sides and the hopes of the world  including eliminating tit for tat tariffs  a senior Chinese official said on Saturday Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said he was optimistic about negotiations with Washington  but added any trade mechanism achieved must be equal and fair The governments of the world s two largest economies have been locked in a tariff battle for months as Washington presses Beijing to address long standing concerns over Chinese practices and policies around industrial subsidies  technology transfers  market access and intellectual property rights Advances in talks drove the White House to indefinitely delay hikes in tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports that were set to kick in on March 2  Wang  speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of China s ongoing annual meeting of parliament  said slapping tariffs on each other was bad for workers  farmers  exporters and manufacturers   It hurts investor confidence and delays corporate investment decisions   said Wang  who has been deeply involved in the trade talks with the United States  Now  the economic and trade teams of the two sides are making full efforts to communicate and negotiate in order to reach an agreement in line with the principles and directions decided by the two heads of states   he added  That is to remove all the tariffs imposed on each other  so that bilateral trade relations between China and the United States can return to normal  The trade talks have seen senior officials shuttling backwards and forwards between Beijing and Washington Giving rare details into the talks  Wang said the two countries had been making extra effort to find areas in common  During the talks Vice Premier Liu He and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer enjoyed take out food  he said   Vice Premier Liu had a hamburger  and Lighthizer had eggplant and chicken   he added  describing a common Chinese dish  Throughout the negotiations  there was coffee and tea  but the two of them did not drink any coffee  did not drink any tea  They both drank hot boiled water  This is to find common ground  It is unclear when or where senior negotiators from both sides will next meet Trump administration officials have not made any new plans to send a team to China for face to face trade talks though there is much work left to be done to reach a deal  White House trade adviser Clete Willems said on Friday   Reporting by Ryan Woo and Yawen Chen  Writing by Stella Qiu and Ben Blanchard  Editing by Michael Perry 
SACRAMENTO  Calif    The federal government has rejected  306 million in reimbursements for California s repair of damaged spillways on the nation s tallest dam  a state agency said Friday California has so far requested about  639 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the Oroville Dam repairs  said Lisa Lien Mager of the state s Natural Resources Agency  FEMA has agreed to cover  333 million That s less than about a third of the  1 1 billion the state s Department of Water Resources said it took to repair the dam  Spillways on the Oroville Dam crumbled and fell away during heavy rains in February 2017  forcing nearly 200 000 people to evacuate amid fears the dam would collapse  Disaster was ultimately averted  but the dam needed significant repair The agency rejected  306 million in repairs for the dam s upper gated spillway because it was damaged prior to the heavy rain  FEMA spokeswoman Brandi Richard said  Two separate independent engineering reviews indicate that a variety of problems existed at the dam prior to the February 2017 floods  FEMA s Public Assistance can only fund work directly linked to the declared disaster   Richard said in a statement California plans to appeal  though it has not yet received a formal memo from FEMA outlining its decision  Lien Mager said  The state can seek reimbursement for up to 75 percent of the cost and may be submitting more reimbursement requests soon Local water agencies are already paying some of the repair costs  and anything not covered by the federal government would be kicked to them  We firmly believe that federally required repairs to Oroville after a federally declared emergency should qualify for full federal assistance   Jennifer Pierre  general manager for the State Water Contractors  which advocates for 29 local water agencies Republican state Sen  Jim Nielsen  who represents Oroville  said state water officials have long failed to do routine maintenance  The Department of Water Resources  he said   must be more vigilant in its inspections and more thorough in its maintenance of the Oroville Dam for the safety of the people of Oroville and residents living downstream  Republican U S  Rep  Doug LaMalfa  meanwhile  blamed the state for spending money on other things  such as a high speed rail project  over  fixing known deficiencies at the dam  Last month  the Trump administration threatened to revoke  3 5 billion for California s high speed rail project  prompting a battle with California Gov  Gavin Newsom  There s no indication FEMA s decision is related 
WASHINGTON   U S  productivity grew at a rate of 1 9 percent in the fourth quarter  a slight improvement over the third quarter  Labor costs rose 2 percent  the strongest gain since the beginning of 2018 The Labor Department reported Thursday that the result from the October December period was slightly better than a 1 8 percent rise in the third quarter  For the full year  productivity rose 1 3 percent  a small improvement from a 1 1 percent gain in 2017  It was the best showing since a 3 4 percent productivity surge in 2010 Productivity is the amount of output per hour of work  The strong showing in 2010 had followed a 3 5 percent surge in 2009  Those two strong years were the exceptions in the current nearly 10 year long recovery  Productivity overall has been extremely weak  and economists consider boosting productivity growth as the key challenge facing the U S  economy Since 2007  productivity growth has averaged just 1 3 percent a year  less than half the 2 7 percent gain during the period from 2000 to 2007 and also below the average since 1947 of 2 1 percent annual gains Economists attribute the solid gains before the deep 2007 2009 recession to the increasing use of technology in the workplace  But they have been stumped in trying to explain why productivity has slowed so much since the recession Without a significant improvement in productivity  analysts say that the Trump administration will not be able to achieve its goal of pushing overall economic growth to sustained annual gains of 3 percent in the gross domestic product  GDP growth is determined by two major factors  growth in the labor force and growth in productivity The 2 percent rate of increase in labor costs in the fourth quarter followed a 1 6 percent third quarter gain  Labor costs rose 1 4 percent for the year  lower than the 2 2 percent increase in 2017 The government reported last week that GDP grew at a 2 6 percent rate in the fourth quarter  a slowdown from the previous two quarters  For the year  GDP grew 2 9 percent  the best showing since 2015  However  analysts are forecasting growth to decelerate to just above 2 percent as the boost from the 2017 tax cuts and increased government spending begin to wane In a separate report  the Labor Department said Thursday that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to 223 000 last week  a drop of 3 000 from the previous week  Benefit applications  a proxy for layoffs  have been at ultra low levels for an extended period  underlining the strength of the U S  labor market  The government on Friday will release the February unemployment report  Many economists believe it will show unemployment edged back down to 3 9 percent  from 4 percent in January 
UNITED NATIONS   The United States urged the U N  Security Council on Thursday to impose new sanctions on Iran  saying its recent missile related launches could be capable of delivering nuclear weapons and risk a regional arms race Acting U S  ambassador Jonathan Cohen condemned  Iran s destabilizing activities  in a letter to Secretary General Antonio Guterres obtained by The Associated Press and called on Tehran  to cease immediately all activities related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons  The Trump administration last year pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers  and re imposed U S  sanction on Iran in November that it had eased after the agreement  including targeting its vital oil sector  Under the nuclear agreement  many U N  sanctions on Iran were lifted Cohen said Security Council members should  join us in imposing real consequences on Iran for its flagrant defiance of the council s demands and bring back tougher international restrictions to deter Iran s missile program  He cited a Security Council resolution adopted in 2015 to endorse the nuclear deal that  calls upon  Iran  not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons    but it does not require Tehran to halt such activity At a U N  meeting in December on Iran s compliance with the council resolution  U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was critical of the council for weakening the ban on nuclear capable Iranian missiles that was in effect from 2010 to 2015 He urged members to re impose the ban and to maintain an arms embargo that is scheduled to be lifted in 2020 under the nuclear deal Pompeo accused Iran of building the largest ballistic missile force in the region  capable of threatening the Mideast and Europe  and said it has more than 10 ballistic missile systems in its inventory or in development  He quoted the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard s airspace division  Amir Ali Hajzadeh  boasting that Iran is capable of building missiles with a range beyond 2 000 kilometers  1 200 miles  Cohen cited Iran s Dec  1 launch of a medium range ballistic missile on Dec  1  2018 and its attempt to place satellites into orbit on Jan  15 and Feb  5  using its Simorgh and Safir space launch vehicles  respectively  He said the missile launched on Dec  1 was designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons and the space launch vehicles used  technologies related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of deliveries nuclear weapons  The United States faces an uphill struggle in getting Security Council approval for new sanctions on Iran and Pompeo s proposals  especially because of the U S  withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement  The nuclear deal is still supported by the five other parties   Russia  China  Britain and France  who are all veto wielding Security Council members  and Germany 
DOHA  Qatar   Nearly 11 days after peace negotiations between the United States and the Taliban began with high hopes  it has become clear that any resolution to the 18 year war could be frustratingly slow One of the most prominent issues thwarting progress is a disagreement over a fundamental question  What is terrorism  and who is a terrorist The answer is so important because the two sides had already agreed in principle on a framework for two crucial issues  the withdrawal of American troops  and a commitment that Afghan soil would not again be used to launch terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies  as Al Qaeda did with its strikes on Sept  11  2001  That attack led the Americans to invade Afghanistan in an effort to hunt down Al Qaeda s mastermind  Osama bin Laden The Taliban have said they would not allow Afghanistan to be used as a launching pad for international attacks  American negotiators have insisted on specifying that Afghanistan not be used by  terrorist  groups  but the Taliban have resisted  saying there was no universal definition of terrorism The Taliban dragging their feet on one term might seem to be killing time  but officials  including current and former Taliban members  said it was a sensitive and existential issue for the group  It strikes at the core of the ideological narrative around their 18 year fight  If Taliban leaders were seen as conceding on the issue  it could divide their fighters ImageThe scene after a Taliban bombing in Kabul in January CreditWakil Kohsar Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBoth sides have remained tight lipped about the latest round of talks  saying only that negotiations were continuing But interviews with current and former officials on all sides  who spoke privately because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations  said the talks have nearly collapsed on several occasions  with deep  and at times emotional  disagreements A senior American official close to the talks said that while a significant outcome at the end of this long round was still possible  just the two sides engaging in a forthright and substantive discussion on difficult details had already moved the process forward The Taliban  seizing on momentum on the battlefield  are clearly seeking to negotiate from a position of confidence against Americans facing a ticking clock  with President Trump s desire to withdraw obvious to all   including the Taliban The two sides began the latest round expecting disagreements over the timeline of an American troop withdrawal  as well as the Taliban s stubborn refusal to include the Afghan government in talks about the country s political future ImageZalmay Khalilzad is leading the American side in the talks CreditJim Huylebroek for The New York TimesWhile the Americans have pushed for a gradual withdrawal over three years or longer  Taliban officials have said they want a withdrawal in less than a year  perhaps as soon as six months  The withdrawal would likely be tied to a cease fire that would be rolled out gradually  with violence ceasing in an area as the pullout begins But the issue that has proved particularly nettlesome has been the American demand for guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a place to plan attacks against the United States While the Taliban condemned the 2001 attacks on the United States  its regime did not give in to the American ultimatums to surrender bin Laden  Instead the Taliban asked for evidence to be presented at an international court that the attacks were planned in Afghanistan  When the United States resorted to military action  the Taliban promised to resist it as aggression As frustrations over the definition of terrorism grew in the talks  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  who is briefed regularly by his negotiators  made clear he considers the Taliban themselves terrorists  I have a team on the ground right now trying to negotiate with the Taliban terrorists in Afghanistan  trying to find a way to achieve an Afghanistan that s not at war   he said ImageThe day to day talks have largely been led for the Taliban by Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai CreditPavel Golovkin Associated PressRaising expectations around the latest talks was the presence for the first time of the Taliban deputy leader  Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar  His involvement spurred hopes that the Taliban negotiating team could swiftly make decisions  rather than checking frequently with their leaders in Pakistan But Mullah Baradar has rarely been present in direct negotiations between large groups  Officials say his health seems sapped by nearly a decade of detention in Pakistan  and he is being cared for by his young son Mullah Baradar s presence has  however  provided an important layer of troubleshooting  Every time there has been threat of a breakdown  the American chief negotiator  Zalmay Khalilzad  would get together with him to figure out how to cool off and resume talks The latest round of negotiations are taking place at a sprawling Doha resort  On most days  the talks ended after evening prayer  as a female musician played piano under a large chandelier of the hotel lobby behind curtains separating the talks from resort guests  When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan  they banned music   and women   from public life Lunch breaks have often provided odd juxtapositions  with American officers in their uniforms and boots  and the Taliban in their turbans  trying to tiptoe around the honeymooners and tourists sunbathing in neon bikinis by pristine pools ImageThe Taliban office in Doha  Qatar CreditOsama Faisal Associated PressThe day to day talks have largely been led by Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai for the Taliban  and Molly Phee  a former U S  ambassador to South Sudan and a deputy to Mr  Khalilzad  the American special envoy leading the negotiations  Ms  Phee was also involved in discussions about the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq as a member of the National Security Council during the Obama administration Much of the struggle at the negotiations has involved chipping away at an environment of mistrust  The Taliban think Americans may be using the talks to undermine their momentum on the battlefield  where they control or contest more territory than at any time since their fall in 2001 The Americans  and their Afghan allies on the sidelines  fear the Taliban are slowing negotiations to run down the clock  with President Trump already signaling he wants out of the war anyway For the Taliban  an agreement on the withdrawal of American troops would guarantee something of a victory in their military struggle  After 18 years of fighting  they would have forced American troops to leave  They see their strength in the military fight  but less so in politics and governing   as demonstrated by their struggle to run the country before the American invasion The discussions over the political future of Afghanistan could be messy  Taliban officials said that if they engage in that discussion before they have finalized the timeline for an American military withdrawal  it could affect their fighters  An insurgent army is harder to remobilize once dispersed It remains unclear how much the Taliban will compromise on the issue of political power  Although they have said they do not seek a monopoly  their posture has been one of uncompromising confidence  in part shown in their stubbornness to not meet with the Afghan government  That has raised fears that  even after a deal with the Americans  disagreement over power could continue the war in Afghanistan The Americans have so far tried to link any progress on a withdrawal timeline to the Taliban engaging with Afghans  including the government  Afghan political leaders regularly caution the chief American negotiator against any agreement with the Taliban on withdrawing troops that would result in the Americans losing their leverage before making progress on the political front  I am ready to even sacrifice my life for peace  but not for a peace that will be a new chapter of carnage   Afghan president Ashraf Ghani said in a speech on Wednesday 
QAMISHLI  Syria   The Kurdish led authorities in northern Syria want a multinational force to deploy at the Turkish border and reject the creation of a large  safe zone  that Turkey hopes to control  a Kurdish politician told Reuters  Fawza Youssef said the Kurdish led authorities have proposed their idea in talks with U S  officials while stressing the need for continued joint efforts against Islamic State  which is on the brink of losing its last enclave in eastern Syria The proposal for a deployment at the border aims to counter Turkey s demand for a  safe zone  under its control   an idea that is out of the question for the main Syrian Kurdish groups that fear Turkish plans to attack their region  The question of security arrangements for northern Syria has been brought into focus by the looming territorial defeat of Islamic State in parts of Syria where the United States and its allies have deployed to battle the jihadists The Kurdish led authorities  the main U S  partner in Syria  were left scrambling for a strategy to protect their region from Turkey in December when President Donald Trump abruptly declared his intention to withdraw all U S  forces  Since then  the U S  has partially reversed that decision and will keep 200 troops in Syria to join what is expected to be a total commitment of about 800 to 1 500 troops from European allies to set up and observe a safe zone in the northeast Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia to be a terrorist group indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party  PKK  which has fought an insurgency inside Turkey since the 1980s Ankara  which already controls a chunk of northwestern Syria  has repeatedly threatened to attack the northeast  But the U S  presence has frustrated its plans The Kurdish led authorities reject the idea of a big  safe zone  because it would envelop Syrian towns and cities that are located right at the border  Youssef said  Instead  they are proposing arrangements for a  border strip   This border strip   we do not call it a safe zone   must guarantee security for both sides with international peacekeeping forces  we believe this would be a moderate solution   she told Reuters in an interview in Qamishli  This is our view  There are meetings between American officials and the Turks in recent days too  We don t know what was discussed or what happened  but so far we have proposed this issue in this form   she said  The main point we focus on in this matter is that our areas are  already  safe zones  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday his government could not accept anyone but Turkey taking control of the safe zone Youssef said a multinational force at the border  can be a guarantor for both sides  for the Turkish side and for ours    In the first place  we are the ones suffering from threats  not the Turkish side   she said The prospect of the U S  withdrawal prompted the Kurdish led administration to seek new talks with Damascus with the aim of striking a political deal that would safeguard their autonomy and provide security guarantees against any Turkish attack Youssef indicated there had been no progress  Before any of this happened  we have several initiatives to try to reach a settlement over administrative  political  cultural and other affairs with the regime  So far  the regime has not been responsive with any positive step   she said   Writing by Tom Perry  Editing by Toby Chopra 
The Census Bureau will tap Department of Homeland Security files on millions of immigrants  including noncitizens  as part of its data collection for the 2020 census  bureau officials said Thursday  The move comes as the Trump administration faces court challenges to its efforts to add a citizenship question to the next head count The Homeland Security files would include information on immigrants  citizenship status  addresses and birth dates  and Social Security numbers Experts and analysts outside the agency said the request for data on noncitizens  first reported by The Associated Press  had a number of plausible explanations   and did not necessarily mean the administration was trying to sidestep recent judicial rulings barring the citizenship question In fact the rulings have criticized the Commerce Department  which oversees the Census Bureau  for disregarding a federal law requiring officials to determine whether it can obtain information on noncitizens from federal files   before it burdens citizens with an additional question on census forms During internal deliberations over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 head count  Census Bureau analysts told Commerce Secretary Wilbur L  Ross Jr  that the question was unnecessary because existing federal files   including those in Homeland Security   could provide the same information more accurately and cheaply The Census Bureau said in a statement that it had not gathered data on noncitizens in recent censuses  but added that the new agreement with Homeland Security was neither unusual nor cause for concern The agency said that it routinely supplemented its economic and population surveys with personal files from other federal agencies like the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service  and that is required to strip all identifiable personal information from data it gathers before sharing statistics with the public or the rest of the government  Failure to do so is a federal crime The administration s attempt to add the citizenship question had another setback on Wednesday when a second federal judge barred the addition of the question  ruling that the administration ignored both federal law and the Constitution in its zeal to obtain information on noncitizens A final decision on whether the census can include the citizenship question now rests with the Supreme Court  which has set arguments on the issue for April Most analysts already believe that concerns about the proposed citizenship question will depress the response to the 2020 census among foreign born residents  That  in turn  could skew the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds that are allotted based on population figures  as well as the reapportionment of congressional and state political districts in 2021 On Thursday  critics said the agreement with Homeland Security would heighten fears among noncitizens and even legal immigrants that the administration was trying to sidestep such rulings and build a database of foreigners that could be used for prosecutions and deportations But they acknowledged that those fears are overblown  Federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from cooperating on such a venture  and the bureau s own rigid tradition of nonpartisan service would likely incite a revolt were it ordered to The Census Bureau  is clearly in an uncomfortable situation   said Andrew Reamer  a George Washington University research professor who closely follows Census Bureau data collection   But in my experience  it would never initiate on its own a data request to get around a court order  At the same time  he and other experts said  the fears were predictable  given that the Commerce Department has yet to offer a credible explanation as to why it wants to collect census data on noncitizens Federal courts in California and New York have both ruled that the official reason   that the Justice Department needs better data to enforce voting rights laws   is a pretext for some other undisclosed objective  It s understandable that it s alarming   said Terri Ann Lowenthal  a consultant on census issues who has advised groups that oppose the citizenship question   Given the anti immigration policies of the administration  people who are fearful for their security and their status would see this as another possible effort to harm them

DUBAI  United Arab Emirates   A group of evangelical pastors from the U S  visited the predominantly Muslim Shiite nation of Azerbaijan to promote interfaith dialogue and highlight cooperation with Israel  with pastors saying Thursday the visit has already challenged their views about the potential for coexistence in America s polarized landscape New York based Rabbi Marc Schneier  who led the evangelical delegation  told The Associated Press from the capital of Baku that this was the first ever Christian evangelical delegation to visit Azerbaijan Most of Azerbaijan s population of 10 million are Shiite but it s also home to Sunnis  Christians and around 30 000 Jews  said the rabbi  The country shares borders with both Iran and Russia The group  which included 12 U S  pastors  met President Ilham Aliyev  the foreign minister  Muslim sheikhs  local church leaders  and Israel s ambassador Schneier said Aliyev announced during the delegation s visit that the country s first ever Jewish cultural center would be built in Baku with Kosher dining options and a hotel to accommodate Jewish guests The delegation also visited a Jewish school where children sang Hebrew songs for Israel  I literally had to pinch  I had to pinch myself   Schneier said   Here I am in a Muslim majority country being welcomed into a Jewish school with all these Jewish children singing Israeli songs  It s just a phenomenon that one would be able to experience anything like that  Schneier heads the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding based in New York and founded The Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton Beach  New York  He is at the forefront of building ties between Jews and Muslims in the U S  and the Middle East  Through greater interreligious dialogue  he s pushed for closer relations between Muslim leaders and the state of Israel Last year  there were visits by U S  evangelicals to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  two countries seeking to strengthen ties with the Trump administration through his evangelical base of supporters  The outreach is happening as Gulf Arab states simultaneously take their once private outreach to Israel more public and work to isolate Iran Unlike Arab Gulf states  Azerbaijan already has diplomatic relations with Israel  its national carrier flies direct to Tel Aviv and its president hosted Israel s prime minister in 2016 Pastor Adam Mesa  who leads the Abundant Living Family Church in Rancho Cucamonga  California  said it was his first time in a Muslim majority country  He was encouraged to take part in the trip because of Azerbaijan s supportive Israeli stance and interreligious efforts For many U S  evangelicals  support for Israel is at the very core of their faith  Most believe that before Jesus can return  Jews have to go back to the Holy Land  They also believe the return of the Messiah will follow the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem  also the site of Islam s sacred Al Aqsa Mosque compound  There s been this polarization in our country that we re supposed to be separatists from one another and we re supposed to not interact with one another   Mesa said   It s incredible that a Muslim majority country is the one that has to actually lead the charge on religious dialogue and community and solidarity  He said his talks in Azerbaijan with Catholics  Jews and Muslim sheikhs held no friction  resentment or prejudging  I think we really need to bring that attitude back to America   he said   I really want to emphasize that to my church and other political leaders  Pastor Calvin Battle  who leads Destiny Christian Center in Tulsa  Oklahoma  described the visit as  absolutely incredible   It was also his first time visiting a Muslim country and his first time in a dialogue with sheikhs and learning  how similar  the Abrahamic faiths are  I have to admit it s kind of impaired my ignorances concerning the area and the region and what I came in with  presuppositions concerning the people   he said More than just promoting inter religious tolerance  Azerbaijan too sees political currency in its outreach with Christians and Jews  From a political point of view  listen there is no question you know that Azerbaijan is looking to strengthen its relationship with the U S  administration  with the United States Congress  Israel is very much a conduit to that   Schneier said Azerbaijan s president has maintained close ties with the West  helping protect its energy and security interests and to counterbalance Russia s influence in the strategic Caspian region  At the same time  Aliyev s government has long faced criticism in the West for alleged human rights abuses and suppression of dissent    Associated Press writer Vladimir Isachenkov contributed from Moscow

WASHINGTON   Chelsea Manning  the former Army intelligence analyst who provided archives of secret military documents to WikiLeaks in 2010  was taken into custody on Friday after a federal judge found her in contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury that is investigating the antisecrecy group Judge Claude H  Hilton of Federal District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that Ms  Manning must stay in civil detention until she testifies  Ms  Manning had vowed not to cooperate in the investigation even though prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia granted immunity for her testimony In a statement posted on  Twitter after she was arrested  Ms  Manning said she had ethical objections to the secrecy of the grand jury system and  will not comply  with the subpoena The case is part of a long running criminal inquiry into WikiLeaks and its leader  Julian Assange  that dates to the Obama administration and which the Trump administration revived  Ms  Manning said on Thursday that prosecutors on Wednesday had asked her a series of questions about WikiLeaks before the grand jury  but she had responded to every question by saying it violated her constitutional rights Mr  Assange has been living for years in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid arrest  Prosecutors charged him under seal last summer  a fact they inadvertently revealed in a court filing in November The precise charge against him remains murky  but trying to convict him of a crime for publishing classified information he received from someone else would raise novel and profound First Amendment issues  The Obama administration had decided against trying to charge him because of fears that establishing a precedent that his actions were a crime could chill investigative journalism  Chelsea is a tremendously courageous person and this outcome was not unexpected but this an appealable order   said her lawyer  Moira Meltzer Cohen  after the hearing Joshua Stueve  a spokesman for the United States attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia  said the government did not want to confine Ms  Manning  relaying a statement that Tracy Doherty McCormick  a federal prosecutor  had made after the judge opened part of the contempt hearing on Friday  It has always been our intent and hope for her to testify and comply with the valid court order and valid grand jury investigation   Ms  Doherty McCormick said   Ms  Manning could change her mind right now and do so  It is her choice  This is a rule of law issue  and Ms  Manning is not above the law  During her court martial in 2013  Ms  Manning had admitted sending WikiLeaks large archives of secret documents  Her bulk disclosure vaulted the group and Mr  Assange to global fame years before WikiLeaks gained a different type of notoriety for publishing stolen Democratic emails that Russian hackers had stolen during the 2016 presidential campaign In a lengthy confession in 2013  Ms  Manning said she had interacted online with someone who was likely Mr  Assange  But she said she acted of her own accord and was not directed by anyone at WikiLeaks  Ms  Manning said prosecutors had wanted her to go over those same events  The grand jury s questions pertained to disclosures from nine years ago  and took place six years after an in depth computer forensics case  in which I testified for almost a full day about these events   she said in the statement   I stand by my previous testimony  I will not participate in a secret process that I morally object to  particularly one that has been historically used to entrap and persecute activists for protected political speech  A military judge in 2013 had sentenced Ms  Manning to 35 years in prison  and  and counting her time in pretrial custody  she served about seven years   by far the longest prison time any American has served for leaking government secrets to the public   before President Barack Obama commuted the remainder of her sentence in 2017  As a transgender person struggling to transition to life as a woman  she had a difficult time in a male military prison and twice tried to commit suicide in 2016 The contempt hearing on Friday was partly closed  but the judge had opened it for a portion in which Ms  Meltzer Cohen argued that Ms  Manning should be confined at home  The judge rejected that request and Ms  Manning was taken to the women s wing of the federal detention center in Alexandria  Va   Ms  Meltzer Cohen said Mr  Stueve said federal officials had taken steps to ensure that Ms  Manning s medical needs would be met while she remained in custody Confinement for defying a grand jury subpoena can last until the term of the jury is over  after which prosecutors would have to obtain a new subpoena and start the process over if they wanted to continue to press the issue  Both Ms  Meltzer Cohen and Mr  Stueve declined to say when the current jury s term is set to end 
LOS ANGELES   In an attempt to determine who was behind the caravans that were bringing large numbers of migrants from Central America to the southwest border  the Trump administration created a list of activists and journalists whom they subjected to additional scrutiny when they entered the United States last year Federal immigration authorities faced criticism on Thursday after an internal government document  obtained by NBC 7 San Diego  suggested that immigration activists and journalists were specifically singled out for extra screening at border entry points by the United States and Mexican governments Many of those on the list had traveled with the migrant caravans as they arrived in Mexican border cities from Central America to seek asylum  Others on the list  according to lawyers representing them  had provided legal assistance or aid to migrants  but had not traveled with the caravans at all Customs and Border Protection officials said they had identified people because they may have had information in connection to assaults against Border Patrol agents that took place last November and in January  but said that gathering this type of information was standard  C B P  does not target journalists for inspection based on their occupation or their reporting   Andrew Meehan  the agency s assistant commissioner of public affairs  said in a statement  adding that C B P   has policies in place that prohibit discrimination against arriving travelers and has specific provisions regarding encounters with journalists  Nonetheless  the inspector general for the Homeland Security Department opened an inquiry last month  with C B P    to ensure that all appropriate policies and practices were followed  In Washington  lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee sent a letter on Thursday to Customs and Border Protection criticizing the list and said it raised serious legal and constitutional questions Esha Bhandari  a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union  said that targeting reporters or advocates for secondary screening and extended detention on the basis of their work was a violation of their rights  Ms  Bhandari said the A C L U  was monitoring developments in the cases and exploring all legal options  The implications of this are really disturbing   she said   It is unconstitutional for the government to target people for punishment or retaliation solely based on their first amendment protected activity   Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  Go Nakamura  a freelance photographer whose work has appeared in The New York Times and who was on the list  said he had suspected for several months that his name had been flagged to immigration officials In an interview Thursday  he recalled being stopped by Mexican authorities in late December while he was near the border fence in Tijuana to take photographs of migrants  The officers asked to see Mr  Nakamura s passport  something he had not experienced during other lengthy assignments on the border  he said  He thought it was strange when the officers took photos of his passport on cellphones Mr  Nakamura  an American citizen  tried to re enter the United States several days later  and initially faced routine questions  He was asked about his background  where he lived  where he went to school  He was also asked about when he began working as a photojournalist But the questioning began to alarm Mr  Nakamura when an officer pulled out a document with pictures of about 10 to 14 faces and asked him to identify them  They asked me if I recognized any of the faces   Mr  Nakamura said   I didn t  so I said no  The officer who showed me the papers  she was asking me if I was connected with the organizers of the caravan  She was like  have you met the organizers or do I know the organizers   I felt like they thought I was a spy or something   Mr  Nakamura said Kitra Cahana  a freelance photographer on the list whose work has also appeared in The Times  said she was barred from entering Mexico on Jan  17while she was en route to photograph another caravan of migrants traveling through the country  As she was about to board a flight from Montreal to Detroit  she scanned her passport at a pre clearance machine  which printed out a picture with an  X over my face   She was taken into secondary questioning in Montreal  but was ultimately allowed to board her flight In Mexico City  she was again detained  That time she was held for about 13 hours  she said  before being officially denied entry to Mexico Mexican authorities confiscated her American passport and cellphone during that period  She was escorted to a flight back to Detroit  Later that month  on Jan  26  she said she tried to cross into Mexico from Guatemala  and was denied entry Ms  Bhandari said there were specific rules outlined by the Justice Department that the government must follow when questioning journalists  which  she said  Customs and Border Protection may have violated  The existence of these dossiers can have a real chilling effect   Ms  Bhandari said   It can suggest to other journalists that if they dare to report on activities that are embarrassing to the United States government  you too can be singled out for this harsh treatment  
 Reuters    Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has opened up a new front in its battle with the U S  government by filing a lawsuit challenging a congressional ban on federal agencies  use of the Chinese technology company s products Legal experts said the firm is likely to lose its case because U S  courts tend to avoid second guessing Congress  actions relating to national security  including the ban enacted in August as part of a defense spending bill But some lawyers said that Huawei might be hoping to score public relations points against the U S  government even if it knows its chances of winning are slim The following explains the measures against Huawei  the nature of the lawsuit  and why it will likely be dismissed What is Huawei and why is it at odds with the U S  government Shenzhen based Huawei is the world   s biggest producer of telecommunications network equipment and it also competes with Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co as a smartphone maker  The company and its founder Ren Zhengfei have long been suspected of having close ties with China s military and intelligence agencies Huawei denies that it works with the Chinese government and that its products are designed to facilitate spying Separately from the legislation at issue in the lawsuit  the United States is also considering a ban on the use of Huawei telecom equipment by U S  companies in the construction of 5G wireless networks  and is urging its allies to do the same  Washington has also accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and violating U S  sanctions on Iran  Chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou  who is also Ren s daughter  was arrested in December in Canada at the request of the U S  Justice Department  which claims she orchestrated the violations  Huawei says the U S  actions are politically motivated  coming at the same time as the Trump administration is holding high stakes trade negotiations with Beijing  U S  demands include that China change its laws and practices to protect intellectual property and end forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms What is Huawei s complaint Huawei s primary argument is that the ban on its products is a  bill of attainder    a legislative act condemning a particular person or group of people and punishing them without a trial Bills of attainders are specifically banned in the U S  Constitution In one of the most well known cases involving a bill of attainder  a unanimous U S  Supreme Court in 1946 struck down as unconstitutional an act of Congress that stripped three government employees of their salaries for allegedly supporting  subversive activities   More recently  a federal judge ruled a North Carolina bill limiting funding to the women s health organization Planned Parenthood was an unconstitutional bill of attainder because it was  adopted specifically to penalize  the group Huawei is also alleging a violation of its due process rights  and argues that Congress violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers by exercising authority reserved for the judicial system Does Huawei have a case Most U S  legal experts say no  since ruling for Huawei would likely require the courts to decide there was no legitimate basis for Congress  inclusion of the ban in its bill In general  U S  courts are reluctant to second guess national security determinations by Congress and the executive branch  who are viewed as being in a better position to make such decisions Several legal experts pointed to a November 2018 decision by a federal appeals court rejecting a similar bill of attainder claim by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab  whose anti virus software was banned from U S  government networks by legislation in 2017 The court in that case said national security concerns about Kaspersky were supported by  ample evidence  and that it needed to give Congress  latitude  to craft measures to protect national security The Texas court hearing Huawei   s case will not be bound by that decision  but will certainly consider its reasoning closely because of the similarities in the two disputes  Why would Huawei bring a lawsuit it is unlikely to win Huawei may figure the potential benefits in terms of public opinion are worth a legal fight  no matter what the outcome  The firm has launched a massive public relations offensive over the past two months  If Huawei s case survives a motion to dismiss  the Chinese company would be allowed to demand discovery from the U S  government  including documents and possibly the testimony of officials Those documents could provide evidence for its position that Washington is motivated more by politics than any real national security concerns  But legal experts said Huawei faces long odds getting past a motion to dismiss  noting the Kaspersky case was thrown out before discovery  The centralized nature of the Chinese government  with its close ties to industry  and the many well documented cases of Chinese hacking would all support the position that the U S  law has a reasonable basis Some legal experts said a case involving a wind energy company owned by Chinese nationals might offer Huawei a slender hope for precedent  Ralls Corp sued after the Obama administration moved in 2012 to block it from building wind turbines close to a military site in Oregon on natural security grounds  A federal court ruled the government violated Ralls  due process rights by not giving it an opportunity to rebut the unclassified evidence the government relied upon to reach its decision The case was resolved in 2015 in a confidential settlement  after which Ralls sold the wind farms   Reporting by Jan Wolfe  Editing by Anthony Lin and Sonya Hepinstall

WASHINGTON   U S  employment growth almost stalled in February  with the economy creating only 20 000 jobs  adding to signs of a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter The meager payroll gains reported by the Labor Department on Friday were the weakest since September 2017  with a big drop in the weather sensitive construction industry  They also reflected a decline in hiring by retailers and utility companies as well as the transportation and warehousing sector  which is experiencing a shortage of drivers The sharp step down in payrolls was another blow to President Donald Trump who has suffered a series of setbacks in recent weeks  including failed nuclear talks with North Korea  a record goods trade deficit despite his administration s  America First  policies and the economy missing the White House s 3 percent annual growth target in 2018 But the stumble in job growth  which followed two straight months of hefty gains  likely understates the health of the labor market as other details of the closely watched employment report were strong The unemployment rate fell back to below 4 percent and a wider measure of underemployment fell by the most ever  In addition  annual wage growth was the best since 2009  and the economy created 12 000 more jobs in December and January than previously reported  bringing the total for the two months to 538 000  We had warned that recent employment gains had overstated the underlying strength of the U S  labor market   said Harm Bandholz  chief U S  economist at UniCredit Research in New York   And the correction now came in February with a bang  rather than spread out over various months   Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made no mention of the latest numbers in remarks delivered more than 12 hours later  noting simply that most measures of the labor market  look as favorable as they have in many decades  and adding that there is  nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response   But the mixed report was another indication the economy  which in July is set to mark a record 10 years of expansion  is slowing as the stimulus from a  1 5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending ebbs  And it supports what Powell on Friday called the Federal Reserve s  patient  wait and see approach to considering any alteration in the stance of policy  The record goods trade deficit is also hurting activity as well as slowing global economies  Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 1 percent annualized rate Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls rose by 180 000 jobs last month  In addition to the weather and rising worker shortages  a stock market selloff and jump in U S  Treasury yields in late 2018  which tightened financial market conditions  also likely curbed hiring The length of the average workweek fell to 34 4 hours last month from 34 5 hours in January  All this report did was remind people that the economy is decelerating and a moderating economy doesn t create a massive number of new positions   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania  U S  stocks fell as the employment report added to concerns of softening global growth sparked by weak China export data and a prolonged slowdown in eurozone  The dollar dropped against a basket of currencies  U S  Treasury prices were mixed SOLID WAGE GAINSJob gains over the last two months averaged 186 000 per month  well above the roughly 100 000 needed to keep up with the working age population  The unemployment rate fell two tenths of a percentage point to 3 8 percent in February  also as federal government workers who were temporarily unemployed during a 35 day partial shutdown returned to work  The longest shutdown in U S  history ended on Jan  25 A broader measure of unemployment  which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment  dropped to 7 3 percent  the lowest since March 2001  from 8 1 percent in January  The decline in the so called U6 rate was the largest since the BLS launched the series in 1994  Average hourly earnings rose 11 cents  or 0 4 percent  in February after gaining 0 1 percent in January  That raised the annual increase in wages to 3 4 percent  the biggest gain since April 2009  from 3 1 percent in January  Overall  wage inflation remains moderate  A report on Thursday showed labor costs rising only 1 4 percent in 2018  the smallest gain since 2016  after increasing 2 2 percent in 2017 Economists say employers have kept hiring at a strong pace despite low unemployment as more people returned to the labor force  including students  women and people who had dropped out to collect disability benefits  They  however  say that source of labor supply is dwindling The labor force participation rate  or the proportion of working age Americans who have a job or are looking for one  was unchanged last month at more than a five year high of 63 2 percent  Economists expect job growth to average about 150 000 this year Last month  employment at construction sites fell by 31 000 jobs  the biggest drop since December 2013  after increasing by 53 000 in January  The leisure and hospitality sector added no jobs after payrolls increased by 89 000 in January The manufacturing sector created 4 000 jobs  the fewest since July 2017  after hiring 21 000 workers in January  The diffusion index of manufacturing employment  which measures the proportion of industries that showed job gains during the month  fell to 51 3 in February  Weakness in capex and exports  much of it tied to knock on effects from the tariffs and trade war confusion generally  are likely behind the slowdown in hiring by the manufacturing sector   said Steve Blitz  chief U S  economist at TS Lombard in New York Retail payrolls fell by 6 100 jobs  There were also job losses in the utilities as well as transportation and warehousing industries  Government payrolls dropped by 5 000 jobs last month  pulled down by declines both local and state government education Professional and business services employment increased by 42 000 jobs in February  The education and health care sector added only 4 000 jobs   Reporting by Lucia Mutikani  Editing by Paul

build a remarkable life in Boston  Years after my first visit to the house  which was a stop on the Underground Railroad  I could still picture the green window shutters and elegant doorway  I associated Lewis Hayden with the place where I grew up  with family  perseverance and good will  So I was disconcerted by what I found when I arrived at the house that autumn day ImageThe Hayden House in Boston CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesThe ruddy bricks  green shutters and white curtains were just as I remembered them  But here was something new   a red  white and blue sticker on the windowpane trumpeting the National Rifle Association  This moment  which might not have caused a reaction in others  set me on a path of reflection  not just on the life of Hayden and those like him  but on the meanings of African American gun ownership and my own deeply held beliefs about guns  What I learned surprised me My response to seeing the sticker was strong  I am an African American historian and  on the matter of guns and most other political issues  decidedly liberal  To me  the pairing of Lewis Hayden and the N R A  felt like an affront  I knew for certain that Hayden fought for the right to be free from violent repression by white citizens wielding the weapons of guns  capital and political influence  I knew that he lost his family through a cruel  extractive system that reinforced   in fact  depended on   the ability of whites to inflict violence on the bodies of black people without legal repercussion ImageA National Rifle Association sticker next to the front door of the Lewis and Harriet Hayden House CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesThe N R A   on the other hand  has long been a boogeyman for me  I see it as an organization that stands in the way of laws to get automatic rifles out of the hands of people who might kill school children  hardened   or unresponsive   to the destruction that rampant gun violence wreaks  Who would plaster this flagrant symbol of white conservatism on the antique home of a black abolitionist who knew what it meant to be hunted  And why These questions nagged at me after my visit  I soon set out to get answers  I contacted the National Parks of Boston  who passed along my contact information to the private owners of the Hayden House  I expected to hear nothing back  instead  I received an invitation  I accepted and agreed to return to the house in February Beforehand  I reviewed the basic historical facts of Hayden s life  When Hayden was a boy  his owner  Adam Rankin  a Presbyterian minister   tore him from his mother and siblings and distributed them to different buyers  Rankin sold Hayden himself for a pair of carriage horses  a trade that honed the young man s scathing analysis of slavery s antihumanism In adulthood  Hayden s first wife and child were also snatched away for the market  Hayden somehow made a new life  remarried  had a son  escaped with his new family to Boston  and operated an apparel shop with his spouse  Harriet Hayden ImageAn old photograph  postcard and writing about Lewis Hayden  kept by the current owners of the historic house CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesAfter earning enough to purchase his freedom  ransoming the life that should have always been his own   Hayden organized a fund raiser to pay a  650 fine securing the release from jail of the white abolitionist who had aided his escape  a Methodist minister from the Midwest  Calvin Fairbank   Hayden chose the activist life  fighting for the dignity of others as part of what the historian Manisha Sinha called the  shock troops  of  fugitive slave rescues   in her book  The Slave s Cause   The home that the Haydens made  the one I would soon be visiting  became a refuge for the hunted On the day of my visit  the homeowners  Mary and John Gier  ushered me in with warm smiles and graciously served tea and cookies  The couple  who are proud of their heritage  English  Dutch  Irish and German  but resist hyphenated labels like  Euro American  or  African American   told me they bought the house in the 1970s  They cherish their historic home and have preserved or replicated most of the original features  cabinetry  doors  windows  flooring  fireplaces  and exterior brown brick  Even the 19th century tunnel is visible in the subbasement  Lovingly restored and furnished with period antiques  the house looks much the same as it might have during Hayden s residence   Harriet Beecher Stowe probably sat there having tea just like you are   they noted   This is the same room where Hayden met with his band of resisters  Mrs  Gier confirmed that the sticker was a relatively recent addition to the facade  but it was clear she and her husband saw the N R A  emblem as simpatico with the home s spirit  To them  Lewis Hayden is a  model for America   Mrs  Gier thinks if he were alive today  he would be a member of the N R A  or the National African American Gun Association   Can you imagine what would have happened had he not had his guns   she said   I believe that Hayden would have left no stone unturned to maintain his defense  In that sense  he is not unlike our law abiding citizens today who are protecting their constitutional rights  I am anti gun and support strict gun control laws  But sipping tea with the homeowners  walking the floors where the Haydens and their compatriots had plotted what turned out to be the roots of a political revolution to overturn slavery  pried ajar a little door in my mind ImageThe owners also have an old newspaper illustration that shows musket guns owned by Lewis Hayden CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesHayden was indeed a man who believed in firepower  He was legendary for threatening slave catchers who showed up at his doorstep in pursuit of fugitives  His home was  converted into a veritable fortress  with doors and windows double locked and barred   write the historians James Oliver Horton and Lois Horton in  Black Bostonians   The Hortons describe William and Ellen Craft s visit in 1848  after the pair fled Georgia in a brilliant escape from slavery  William posed as the property of his wife  a woman light enough to pass for white  Ellen dressed like a man to perfect the ruse  Their destination was the Hayden home where  as the story goes   Hayden s son and a number of armed men  secured the premises   Two kegs of gunpowder had been placed on the front porch  and while the slave catchers watched in disbelief  Hayden lit a torch threatening to blow up his house  himself  and anyone attempting to enter  While the historian Stephen Kantrowitz cautions in his book  More Than Freedom  that Hayden s actions were embellished over time  he traces the claim that  Hayden had readied kegs of gunpowder in the basement  in case slave hunters forced their way inside   to a statement by William Craft himself  Drawings of the interior of Hayden s home from an 1889 edition of The Boston Evening Transcript show rifles leaning against the back parlor wall above the caption   The Guns Were Always Ready for Use in an Emergency   ImageHarriet Tubman CreditFrom  Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman   by Sarah H  Bradford  1869 Of course  Hayden was not alone in his stance of armed self defense in the pre Civil War era  Ms  Sinha notes   Black abolitionists  especially those involved in the abolitionist underground and Vigilance Committees  tended to arm themselves   fugitive slaves  often resorted to armed self defense when confronted by slave catchers and law enforcement   The Underground Railroad activist Harriet Tubman was said to carry a revolver and did not hesitate to point it  according to her biographer  Sarah Bradford  Of course  just as racism and discrimination did not disappear  neither did the movement for black self defense  In the tumultuous civil rights era of the 1950s and  60s  black activists and community organizers openly took up arms  And not just those in the more explicitly militant Black Power movement  Martin Luther King Jr   several N A A C P  officials and other leaders perceived as much more dovish  still carried or stored weapons to defend their households and communities from potential attacks  ImageTarik and Geneva Chambers  who are members of Black Guns Matter  at their home in Philadelphia

about today  In what might be described as another moment of peril for African Americans   with rates of racially motivated hate crimes on the rise  organized white supremacist rallies and open advocacy of white power ideology becoming more common   black gun ownership has surged  The numbers increased markedly after the election of Donald Trump  according to reporting from NPR  Some identify as  gun comfortable   like the political scientist Jason Johnson  who attended the 2017 N R A  convention and concluded at The Root com that the event stoked  white fear of imaginary terrorists  black thugs and immigrants   Others are  super assertively pro gun   like Maj Toure  founder of Black Guns Matter  Mr  Toure is a former member of the N R A   and he told me in a phone interview that there are many more black members who will speak of their involvement only in  hushed tones   While he is critical of the N R A  for not doing more for urban Americans  he sees the group as an important civil rights organization In 2015  Philip Smith founded the National African American Gun Association in Georgia  His members  he said  are predominantly first time gun owners and educated professionals   engineers  doctors  state workers  federal workers  stay at home moms   While he has close ties to the N R A   Mr  Smith s goal was to build a black association that was  self governed  self maintained  self driven   Today  Mr  Smith said  the N A A G A  has 75 chapters in 30 states  He expects to be in every state within a year  Black gun owners are not a monolith  Mr  Smith stresses   We have black Republicans  Democrats  gay  straight   In what may come as a surprise to some  black women make up 60 percent of the association s membership  according to the group  Women are the ones  driving our organization  driving gun sales   he said  Even black gun owners preparing for natural or human made disasters   preppers    which he estimates make up about 5 to 10 percent of N A A G A  s membership  are growing in visibility ImageSharon Ross  creator of the website Afrovivalist  counsels and trains women of color who want to be armed CreditChad Brown for The New York TimesSharon Ross  creator of the website Afrovivalist  sees Afro survivalism as a growing movement inclusive of all people of color  She said she counsels and trains women of color who want to be armed   It s amazing what we don t know   Ms  Ross said  speaking by phone from her home in Oregon   As people of color  we don t have the stockpile that the average Joe white guy has   Ms  Ross said she is preparing for extremes   climate disaster  even war   If there is some kind of race war   or whatever it might be   we re definitely outnumbered when it comes to firearms and bullets   In 2018  she was featured in an episode on black survivalists in BuzzFeed s Netflix documentary series  Follow This  Aton Edwards  founder of the International Preparedness Network  was featured in a segment of the show as well  In one scene he addresses a group of trainees  asking   What s our community going to do  Ask for help  From the Trump administration    Every other day on the internet we re hit with another racist attack  and another  and another  This is America in 2018  You d think that this is 1818  the way this is going down   ImageSaleem Gilmore is a member of the National

lauding the Winchester rifle and abolitionist Frederick Douglass as heralding  the ballot box  the jury box  and the cartridge box   African American gun proponents link the present day climate to struggles of two hundred years ago and conclude that wisdom compels armed defense Even as the survivalist movement took me a distance from my own experience  unlike Ms  Ross  I would have no idea how to kill a wild turkey and roast it for dinner   I began to wonder  What about those close to me  I took an informal family poll that left me reeling  I learned my relatives have guns  They store weapons in hidden chambers inside homes where we gather  they possess permits to carry concealed weapons and take target practice  they have friends who bring guns to church in case the congregation should need shielding  they are prepared to  protect my family no matter who comes through the door  and readying themselves for a  major environmental act  ImageMaj Toure  a former N R A  member founded Black Guns Matter in Philadelphia CreditDamon Winter The New York TimesImageJustin Harris at The Gun Range in Philadelphia CreditDamon Winter The New York TimesAt last  I was left having to examine myself   You re not anti gun   Mr  Toure told me   Ask yourself this  It s a zombie apocalypse  Tomorrow  you wake up  and you can t find your children  You go out to search for them  Do you want a gun now   His analogy was not outlandish  This was  of course  the constant threat enslaved people endured  Had I been fooling myself about my anti gun stance  I don t think so  but I did come to realize through a series of unexpected exchanges that the issue was more complicated than I had allowed and that my views of just coexistence and human flourishing might not require the absolute prohibition of arms I concede that Lewis Hayden could be viewed as a champion of the right to bear arms in defense of freedom  But more than that  he dedicated himself to community building  forging a complex  self funded  interracial network of people joined in common cause  Guns were there to defend those things  The home he made with Harriet was a gathering place for the Boston Vigilance Committee  for progressive white Bostonians and for members of the enslaved and free black population  Mr  Kantrowitz observed that Hayden sought to build  a world of common struggle against slavery in which racial hierarchy seemed to dissolve into human unity and affection   Together  Lewis and Harriet Hayden opened their doors to those on the run  turning their home into a haven for strangers whom the federal government deemed illegals This is the essence of his example that I hope our community and country will follow  After sipping tea at the Hayden House  I am still suspicious of the N R A   and I would not abide having a gun inside my dwelling or my children s schools  But where would I want to be if civil society topples and 2020 feels like 1820  In a home like the Haydens   in a neighborhood like the North Slope of 19th century Beacon Hill  in a community fortified by love in action and maybe a powder keg beneath the floorboards We want to hear from youOpinion  Readers  Join

CARACAS  Venezuela   Venezuela ground to a halt Friday as a national power blackout entered its second day  stalling public transportation  decimating already scarce food supplies  crippling the vital oil industry and threatening the lives of thousands of chronic patients A failure at the Guri hydropower plant  which provides the bulk of Venezuela s electricity  has left most of the country without power since Thursday afternoon  While power returned intermittently to parts of Caracas  the capital  by Friday afternoon  many states remained without electricity Officials in Venezuela quickly blamed the opposition and the United States for causing the blackout through  sabotage   but did not provide evidence  Guri is a militarized zone protected around the clock by soldiers Analysts and electricity sector contractors said the blackout was the result of years of mismanagement and corruption  which have brought the grid  transmission towers and generation plants to the breaking point  Not one of more than a dozen diesel  and natural gas powered backup plants built by the government in the last decade came online to compensate for the Guri outage  It s further evidence of the government s lack of resources to maintain critical infrastructure   said Risa Grais Targow  an analyst at Eurasia Group with expertise on Venezuela   It seems to be a transmission issue at Guri  which would normally be offset by thermoelectric generation but in this case isn t  both because of the decay in that infrastructure and potentially due to lack of thermal inputs to fire those plants  Elliott Abrams  the Trump administration s special representative for Venezuela  denied during a briefing on Friday that the United States bore any responsibility for the blackout  whether direct or indirect  through the sanctions it has imposed on the country  This is a multiyear decline in Venezuela   Mr  Abrams said   The situation there  due to the mismanagement  the economic policies and the sheer corruption of this regime  are the cause of those problems  President Nicolás Maduro has not addressed the nation since the start of the blackout  confining himself to one Twitter post on Thursday evening in which he said the  electrical war  unleashed by the United States against Venezuela would be defeated  His public silence has fed the tension gripping Caracas In his absence  the opposition leader Juan Guaidó took to the streets of eastern Caracas Friday to question Mr  Maduro s explanation and denounce his poor governance ImageThe opposition leader Juan Guaidó rallied supporters in Caracas  Venezuela s capital  on Friday to denounce government mismanagement CreditRayner Pena EPA  via Shutterstock Sabotage is corruption  sabotage is lack of free elections  sabotage is the blockade of food and medicine   he posted on Twitter  His message is likely to be lost to most Venezuelans  who remain without power or cellular coverage Mr  Guaidó  who claimed Venezuela s presidency earlier this year  pointing to evidence of fraud in Mr  Maduro s re election  has called the population to demonstrate on Saturday The Maduro administration has been responsible for grossly mismanaging the economy and plunging the country into a deep humanitarian crisis in which many people lack food and medical care  He has also attempted to crush the opposition by jailing or exiling critics  and using lethal force against antigovernment protesters The blackout may further anger the population and increase pressure on Mr  Maduro  and if it does not end soon  could fuel clashes in the coming days  said Ms  Grais Targow  On the political and social front  it s problematic for a government that is trying to avoid any potential catalysts for social explosions in an already tense political and social environment   she said of the blackout   So far  the population seems to be relatively calm  but if this persists without resolution and starts to hit food supplies and hospitals  ability to function more severely  the popular backlash will probably be severe  As much of the country remained without electricity  the sole television station transmitting to the few households with power mostly showed soap operas and old news Downtown Caracas was largely empty Friday morning  The government canceled classes and most shops  banks and government buildings  including the Ministry of Electric Power  remained shuttered  Units of special police forces patrolled the main streets  where groups of public sector workers loitered in vain hope of resuming work Backup generators buzzed around hospitals  which were trying to keep the most vulnerable patients alive About 50 babies requiring intensive care are born in Venezuela daily  and there are about 15 000 kidney patients in the country who need dialysis treatment  said Jaime Lorenzo  head of the Venezuelan medical charity Médicos Unidos  They could die if the power is not restored  he said In the emergency rooms of Dr  José María Vargas Hospital in Caracas  doctors scrambled to rotate critical patients on the few pieces of equipment connected to a backup generator ImageGovernment workers trying to get generators to start in downtown Caracas  Many people lacked oil to power their generators CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York Times There were stretchers jumbled everywhere in the emergency and doctors taking off oxygen masks from some patients to put them on others   said Belisario Jiménez  52  who was admitted to the hospital s intensive care unit after falling down a set of stairs   A lot of us are going to die here  At least I have lived my share  At the Olam Deli bakery in downtown Caracas  workers scrambled in darkness to sell the remaining loaves of bread before they went bad  They said the power cut had soured a day s worth of dough  worth the equivalent of 56 minimum monthly wages in the country  The bakery s supply of expensive cheese and cold meats sat in a thawing freezer  All I can do is pray that the power comes back before I lose everything   said the bakery s manager  Kevin  who asked that his last name not be used for fear of government reprisal The blackout will further depress Venezuela s already collapsing economy  which is being squeezed by bad governance  graft and sanctions imposed by the United States  The sanctions have affected Venezuela s ability to import and produce the fuel required by the thermal power plants that could have backed up the Guri plant once it failed The power failure risks hurting the already declining oil production  Venezuela s main source of revenue  by damaging equipment and operational systems  said Ali Moshiri  formerly the top Chevron executive overseeing company operations in Venezuela  All of the oil field production is tied into the public grid and if the public grid goes down  those fields get shut in   he said  He added that for years he had advised the government to install independent power supplies for the oil fields to guarantee reliability  but officials did not follow up To add to the regime s economic woes  a World Bank arbitration panel on Friday awarded ConocoPhillips  an American oil company  more than  8 billion for Venezuela s seizure of the Houston based company s production assets in 2007  Venezuela may appeal An earlier arbitration awarded ConocoPhillips  2 billion  which Venezuela agreed to pay last year when the company began seizing the Caribbean assets of Pdvsa  the national oil company To many Venezuelans  conditions already feel unsustainable  At the hospital  one of the doctors who spent the overnight shift trying to keep intensive care patients stable broke into tears outside the neurosurgery unit  Yesterday I felt impotence   said Rosangel Zuta  about the night spent trying to help and protect patients without the proper equipment to do so   I am angry  This time  it was my patients  but what if later on  it is my family  
Each week  technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week s news  offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry  Want this newsletter in your inbox  Sign up here Hi  I m Jamie Condliffe  greetings from London  Here s a look at the week s tech news Can Facebook profit from privacy You can t have missed it  Facebook plans to shift people toward private messaging and away from the public broadcasting on which its business was built  Think encrypted communications among smaller groups of people  and ephemeral messages that can be deleted  In theory  that change could help the company overcome some of the problems it has faced But Facebook has promised privacy features before that have never appeared   something skeptics were quick to point out after the plan was revealed on Thursday  I understand that many people don t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy focused platform   Mark Zuckerberg  the company s chief executive  wrote in a 3 200 word manifesto describing the shift If we are to assume he means it  there s still a huge problem  He lacks a business model A shift to a private Facebook would crimp its current revenue streams  Most of its profits come from targeted ads enabled by the open sharing of content  In the encrypted future that Mr  Zuckerberg imagines  that will be hard  The company would also effectively rule out expansion into big potential markets like Russia and China  because it won t run servers in countries with authoritarian governments So how can it make money  Mr  Zuckerberg mentions commerce and payments  which fits with reports that Facebook is building a cryptocurrency  But that s all he says  really Mr  Zuckerberg seems O K  with the lack of a plan   The basic way that we ve approached things is first to focus on building the consumer service that people really want   he said to Wired   That will be the foundation  If we do that well  the business will be fine  Of course  a trick for monetizing private messaging may be hidden in his back pocket  If it isn t  his critics  skepticism may be proved right Big Tech antitrust  in the HouseEarlier in the week  Representative David Cicilline  the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the House antitrust subcommittee  proposed an idea to curb Big Tech s dominance During the Great Depression  the Glass Steagall Act forced banks to separate commercial and investment banking operations  Mr  Cicilline told the Financial Times that something similar could apply to tech  It s an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information   he said Sadly  this feels like a nonstarter  Splitting the operations of banks was relatively straightforward  the data sales and platform components of companies like Google and Facebook are  whatever Mr  Zuckerberg says  deeply intertwined Still  it s probably one of many options   There aren t easy answers  to Big Tech antitrust questions  Mr  Cicilline said to Bloomberg Opinion in January   We re not going to approach this  like   Here s my solution   He has the wind at his back  Congressional hearings with Facebook and others last year revealed that lawmakers in both parties have antitrust concerns about tech companies  And the Federal Trade Commission recently announced a task force of 17 lawyers dedicated to  monitoring competition in U S  technology markets   The commission s director of competition  Bruce Hoffman  said some companies could be forced to  spin off  previous acquisitions How far these efforts will go   and how quickly   remains unclear  It may be difficult to prove violation of federal antitrust law until the laws are updated to better apply to technology companies  And splitting a company like Facebook or Google would require costly  lengthy legal battles that the government may yet balk at Who s to blame for robo car deaths Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they wouldn t charge Uber with a crime after one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian last year  Instead  they said investigators should look into what the safety driver  would or should have seen that night  One interesting point about the news was raised by Frank Douma  a researcher at the University of Minnesota s Center for Transportation Studies  It s a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision making  The  handoff problem    that humans are too easily distracted to safely retake control of an autonomous vehicle in an emergency   is well documented  The Uber accident provided a first glimpse of how the law would deal with that issue  It suggests that  for now  the onus remains on the  driver  Huawei is angry  Maybe too angry The Chinese telecom giant Huawei sued the United States government on Wednesday over a ban that prevents government agencies from using the company s products because they may violate national security  Days earlier  Meng Wanzhou  the company s chief financial officer  sued the Canadian authorities for arresting her Huawei is aggrieved by the Trump administration s hardware ban and its lobbying of other governments to shun the company s products when building 5G wireless data networks  The lawsuits are just one response  A defensive advertising campaign and outspoken interviews were already in play Those more conventional lobbying approaches may have been working  Countries like Britain and Germany  which have considered the White House s pleas  have wavered and may ultimately use Huawei hardware But the lawsuits make Huawei look rash and aggressive  Is that the kind of company a government wants to help build critical infrastructure And some stories you shouldn t missThe National Security Agency stopped its controversial phone spying  The system  which analyzed logs of Americans  domestic calls and texts and was introduced to surveil conspirators in Al Qaeda  has been scrapped Google said it was paying male workers too little  It gave  9 7 million in additional compensation to level things up for 10 677 employees  about 69 percent of them men  But the survey that led to the raises did not address a critical question  Are women hired at a pay grade below their qualifications Net neutrality is back in Washington  Congressional Democrats announced bills that seek to reinstate net neutrality rules  Whether the bills can pass is another matter Chinese hackers hit universities  An elaborate set of attacks sought to steal research about military maritime technology Artificial intelligence cameras can spot shoplifters before they steal  Software can identify  restlessness and other potentially suspicious body language   according to Bloomberg  You don t know data overload  Gizmodo invites you

The first thing you notice about the filmmaker Gregg Araki is his hands  It is two weeks before the premiere of his first foray into television   Now Apocalypse   and he s sitting on the walled off patio of a Starbucks in North Hollywood as unseen cars whiz behind him  While he describes the show as the  culmination of every movie I ve ever done   his legacy is tattooed across his knuckles   NOW HERE  The tattoo is a reference to  Nowhere   his seminal 1997 portrait of Gen Xers raised in the shadow of the H I V  AIDS crisis  having sex  getting high and getting obliterated by an unexplained reptilian menace  Films like  The Living End    Mysterious Skin  and  Kaboom  further cemented his preoccupation with  in Araki s words   sexually confused young people  in End Times America  Now Apocalypse   a half hour comedy that begins Sunday on Starz  shows the years haven t changed him  Written by Araki and Karley Sciortino  a sex columnist at Vogue  the series picks up where those films left off  Avan Jogia  TV s  Caprica   plays Uly  a 20 something slacker who can t tell if doomsday is upon us or he just smoked too much pot  The show shares the trappings of Araki s earlier work   alleyway hookups  three ways with Antifa protesters  alien lizards   but his trademark obsessions are especially timely in this politically charged cultural climate In a recent interview  Araki discussed what it took for one of the key figures of the New Queer Cinema era to make a show so fitting with the Trump era  These are edited excerpts from the conversation ImageFrom left  Juno Temple  Thomas Dekker and Haley Bennett in Araki s film  Kaboom  CreditMarianne Williams IFC Films Kaboom  was initially envisioned as a TV show before it became a feature film  Why did you feel it was time to take another crack at a series I ve been wanting to do a TV show like this for at least 20 years  I m really excited about the idea of TV because you can tell this longer story  and you develop a different relationship with TV than you do with a movie  Because it comes into your house every week  these people become very much like your friends  My friends and I talk about  Sex and the City  like they re friends of ours  Now Apocalypse  reminded me of that doomsday paranoia you were tapping into back in 2010 with  Kaboom   It felt even more relevant today  Do you feel the world has become more like a Gregg Araki movie in the past nine years When Karley and I first wrote   Now Apocalypse    we started during the twilight years of the Obama administration  That s why the show has that almost utopian quality of free love   these kids having sex and figuring themselves out  Then 2016 happened  There s always been that darker  Lynchian aspect of the show  but that became more pronounced  The specific example I give is Episode 1  when Ulie and Gabriel are in front of the coffee shop after their date and they re kissing good night  then the fag bashers drive by  That was actually added after 2016 because it was that feeling of the world being a little more dangerous than it used to be ImageTyler Posey  left  and Avan Jogia in a scene from the TV series  Now Apocalypse   The show barters in  among other things  alleyway hookups and alien lizards CreditKatrina Marcinowski StarzIt s interesting that you describe the show as a utopia because of the furtiveness of male male relationships in your previous work  There are all these scenes in  Doom Generation  of the male characters looking at each other with such longing but never knowing quite how to articulate it  In  Now Apocalypse   there s so much sex  How has your own relationship with depicting sexuality onscreen evolved The political world we live in right now is all about  Make America Repressive Again   We ve made so much progress since I started making films  The world has changed so much   for the better   that it s really upsetting to me to go backward after we ve come so far  The overriding message of the show is that people should be able to just be themselves and live their lives without fear of violence or oppression In  Now Apocalypse   one of the characters says sexual fluidity is a  requirement  for the new generation  but your depictions of adolescence have always shown different facets of queerness  Did that feel more true to your own experience When we were at Sundance  Karley said   I saw  Nowhere  when I was 18 and I had blue hair and was living in London  That movie changed my life  I d never seen a depiction of sex  sexuality and fluidity like that before   I believe that sexuality is on a spectrum  There are people that are 99 percent straight and 99 percent gay  but there s a lot of people in between  The world   and particularly young people today   are much more open to that ImageFrom left  Roxane Mesquida  Beau Mirchoff  Jogia and Kelli Berglund in  Now Apocalypse  CreditKatrina Marcinowski StarzWhat has it been like for you to see the movement that L G B T Q  people have made in the past couple of decades I think it s fantastic  I do think that we live in a little bit of a bubble here in L A   New York or San Francisco  It s not so easy for kids in Idaho or North Dakota   these places that are not as accepting and open minded  That s one of the most exciting things for me about  Now Apocalypse   Because it s TV  it s not something like  Kaboom  or  Nowhere  where it s like   Oh  I ve got to figure out where to see this if there s a theater anywhere within 100 miles of here   Some closeted kid in some faraway town somewhere can watch this show  and it s really rewarding for me as a filmmaker that it could give a kid like that hope It must feel surreal for you because preservation has been so unkind to many of your movies  For a long time  one was stuck with mostly VHS copies with terrible audio  if you could find the films at all  Now you have the resources of a multimillion dollar cable network My first film at Sundance was  The Living End   It was this 16 mm punk rock movie  and we made it for  20 000  It was so wild  however many years later  to be back at Sundance with this show that s on Starz   My work  started out in the early  90s as something that was so far out of the mainstream   just this weird indie movie   but now you drive down Sunset and there s a billboard  for  Now Apocalypse   next to the billboard for  A Star Is Born   It s really mind boggling for me If you had a Season 2  what would you hope to tackle Everything  The model of the show is very much like  Girls    Insecure  and  Looking    HBO R rated sex comedies  But the problem with those shows in 2019 is that you really run out of stories  By Season 2  everybody s  expletive  everybody  Everybody s cheated on everybody  and there s nowhere to go  Those shows die on the vine really quickly  This show has always had this other layer  which is this sci fi  surreal aspect of it For me  that s the wild card that keeps the show alive  I always wanted the show to be really unpredictable  I hate shows where you feel like   I know where this is going   That s what happens in these millennial comedies is that you already know what s going to happen  I love  Insecure  to death  but the last season  I wanted something to happen  I ve seen it all already When we started the scripts for Season 2  I told  Gregory Jacobs  an executive producer    I just don t want to repeat Season 1   We re about six scripts into Season 2  It s going to be amazing  I hope we get to do it 
MOSCOW   On a rainy afternoon this week  a group of Russian officials and oil executives gathered for Mass in a Catholic church tucked away behind the imposing secret service headquarters in central Moscow They did not come to pray  Instead  they were commemorating the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez  who poured billions of dollars into Russian weapons and machinery  and showing support for his embattled successor  Nicolás Maduro Mr  Maduro is fighting to save the political system he and Mr  Chávez have built  with Russian support  for two decades  Mr  Maduro s catastrophic economic mismanagement has led the opposition to claim the country s leadership with the support of the United States  the European Union and most South American nations To Russia  it was the latest attempt by the West to topple an adversarial government and check President Vladimir V  Putin s global outreach  The Kremlin reacted by closing ranks around Mr  Maduro and offering him unequivocal diplomatic support  which was on display at St  Louis of France Church on Wednesday Russia s top Latin America diplomat  Alexander Shchetinin  and Igor Sechin  the powerful chief of Russia s biggest state owned oil company  Rosneft  were among those who laid flowers on Mr  Chávez s memorial  But behind the official show of unity  Russia s economic and political elites are becoming increasingly divided on how best to preserve their interests As Mr  Maduro and the opposition leader  Juan Guaidó  settle into a war of attrition  the Kremlin faces a stark choice  to double down on its ally or to be among those who choose his successor The path Mr  Putin takes will help determine whether Venezuela peacefully changes government  slides into civil war or consolidates as a repressive pariah under Mr  Maduro  Russia s global image and weight is at stake in Venezuela   said Vladimir Rouvinski  political scientist at the Icesi University in Cali  Colombia   The initial shock and fear in Russia that they would lose everything in Venezuela is being replaced by the possibility that they can become part of a negotiated transition and ensure their interests are respected  ImageMarking the anniversary of Hugo Chávez s death in Moscow in 2016 CreditGrigoriy Sisoev Sputnik  via Associated PressThese interests range from Venezuelan oil projects and military contracts held by Russian state firms to the geopolitical value of having an anti American ally in the Western Hemisphere In recent years  Rosneft has emerged as Venezuela s biggest oil partner and lender of last resort  taking stakes in five crude producing projects and lending Mr  Maduro s government around  7 billion in return for oil  Venezuela still owes Rosneft about  2 3 billion  according to a company presentation in February Venezuela also owes  3 1 billion to the Russian Finance Ministry for weapons  trucks and grain purchased on credit  Finally  Moscow s state arms exporter has lucrative contracts to maintain Venezuela s Russian made tanks  fighter jets and air defense systems  These are significant sums  but it s not something that would sink the Russian economy   said Alexander Gabuev  a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center   It s about Putin s ability to project Russia as a global power  Close ties with Venezuela have allowed Mr  Putin to challenge America in its backyard  Both Mr  Chávez and Mr  Maduro have traveled to Russia  visiting machine gun factories and state farms  Mr  Chávez was one of the few leaders to recognize the Russian backed separatist republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia  while Mr  Maduro supported the Russian military campaign in Syria Russia responded with symbolic gestures like flying a Russian chamber choir to Mr  Chávez s hometown and inaugurating a Hugo Chávez street in Moscow These economic and personal ties have made Russia arguably the only ally besides Cuba that can exert influence on Mr  Maduro  said Mr  Rouvinski  the political scientist  They have also raised the costs of Mr  Maduro s downfall to the Kremlin To try to loosen these ties  Venezuela s opposition has repeatedly said that Russia s investments would be respected by a new government  The country will need capital to recover from its dire economic crisis  they said  and Russian companies would be welcome in the reconstruction ImageIgor Sechin  left  with Mr  Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in Maiquetia  Venezuela  in 2017 CreditMiraflores Palace  via ReutersBy sticking with Mr  Maduro  Russia increases the opposition s dependence on America  which could lobby a new government to cancel Rosneft s contracts and send Russian weapons to the scrapyard  the opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado said  The longer they wait  the more they risk losing everything   he said   Their investments are safe here  but they need to come to the negotiating table before it is too late  The Trump administration has repeatedly said that all options are on the table to force Mr  Maduro s exit  including military intervention  a specter that has split Russian policymakers On one side are pragmatic technocrats and career diplomats who believe Mr  Maduro s disastrous economic performance makes his government unsustainable Russian diplomats have reopened channels with Venezuela s opposition after a brief halt following Mr  Guaidó s proclamation  according to opposition leaders and people close to the Russian Foreign Ministry In public statements  Russian Foreign Ministry officials have gone in the past few weeks from unequivocally supporting Mr  Maduro to offering to mediate negotiations with the opposition or hold talks on Venezuela with the United States  Venezuela has largely disappeared from the saber rattling talk shows of Russian state television This contrasts with the hard line position taken by Russia s defense and security establishment  which includes Rosneft s Mr  Sechin  a former KGB officer  They see Venezuela s political crisis as part of a global campaign of American subversion against Russia  and believe backing Mr  Maduro is a matter of principle and self defense America s  goal is liquidation of governments of inconvenient countries  the undermining of sovereignty   Russia s chief military strategist  Gen  Valery V  Gerasimov  said at a conference in Moscow last week   Such actions are currently observed in Venezuela  ImageForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez of Venezuela at a news conference in Moscow last week CreditPavel Golovkin Associated PressRosneft has emerged as Mr  Maduro s economic lifeline since the United States slapped crippling sanctions on Venezuela s oil industry in late January  The company said it will lift its production in the country this year and has begun to take up some of the Venezuelan oil exports that used to go to America Rosneft s delivery of gasoline and oil diluent to Venezuela has helped the state owned Petroleos de Venezuela  known as Pdvsa  avoid collapse  It has also been good business for Mr  Sechin  Left without alternative buyers  Pdvsa is forced to sell to Rosneft at a steep discount  according to a Rosneft official and oil trader with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity  Sechin has positioned himself to Putin as Venezuela s curator  the person who will keep the Russian flag flying there   said Mr  Gabuev of Carnegie Center   He has too much wagered on Maduro  Beyond Rosneft s opportunistic oil buying  the Kremlin s effective support of Mr  Maduro is checked by Russia s economic realities Real income in Russia has stagnated since Mr  Putin annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014  sapping domestic support for foreign interventions like Mr  Putin s campaign to prop up Syria s Bashar al Assad  How much milk can we provide to our kids if we don t build another missile for Syria   asked Maria Potapova  a manager at the Blagoveshchensk Dairy Plant in Russia s Far East   They have all the money for Crimea and Syria  Why not spare some for us  The threat of American sanctions has scared away most Russian corporations still doing business in Venezuela  Russia s second largest oil producer  Lukoil  said last month it had stopped trading Venezuelan oil  the state run Gazprombank  once one of Pdvsa s main bankers  has stopped opening new accounts for Venezuelan clients  Even small time orchid importers have left the country A  1 5 billion Kalashnikov machine gun plant built by the state run RosTec in Maracay  meant to symbolize Russia and Venezuela s military cooperation  remains an empty shell 12 years after the start of construction Conditions in Venezuela are terrible and the government has to change  said a person involved in the RosTec project  who spoke on condition of anonymity What Russia wants  he added  is to have a say in who comes next 
WASHINGTON   The Federal Trade Commission has no shortage of critics who say it cannot protect Americans from the prying eyes of Big Tech  Instead of forceful action against the likes of Facebook and Google  they say  the F T C  leans on rules that make it hard to impose penalties bigger than rounding errors for the companies Those critics have an unusual champion  Joseph J  Simons  the man running the agency  We have this over 100 year old statute that is our main authority   Mr  Simons said in his first sit down interview since becoming chairman 10 months ago   And clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issues  In the deregulatory era of the Trump administration  Mr  Simons  60  a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than 30 years  is a rare voice for strengthening the government s hand Mr  Simons has urged Congress to expand the F T C  s privacy enforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily  write new rules and hire more experts  He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits   not just technology companies   collect and handle people s digital data But none of those changes will happen before Mr  Simons must make the most anticipated decision on data privacy in the agency s history  In the coming weeks  he and the F T C  s four other commissioners are expected to conclude an investigation into whether Facebook violated its promises to protect people s data The outcome of the case is seen as a referendum on the government s ability to rein in tech giants that have amassed incredible wealth and power from collecting and bartering user data  The F T C  s decision on Facebook will be highly consequential  for the F T C  and Facebook  for the tech industry  and for consumers   said David Vladeck  who led consumer protection at the agency during the Obama administration   The commission s action will set the bar  The case has taken on huge significance in Washington  where Facebook has become Exhibit A for an industry accused of a wide range of problems  from enabling foreign election interference to crushing competitors A rising chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has criticized the F T C  for not restraining the companies  data collection practices  which are central to some of their businesses  The agency s biggest penalty on a tech company was a  22 million fine imposed on Google in 2012  for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools  Google reported  50 billion in revenue that year On Friday  Senator Elizabeth Warren  the Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president  announced a sweeping plan to strengthen regulations against big tech companies  The F T C  has been a disappointment with its lack of enforcement in the past  which for Facebook and Google has amounted to a slap on the wrist   Senator Josh Hawley  a freshman Republican from Missouri  said in an interview  Mr  Hawley investigated Google for competition violations when he was a state attorney general The Facebook investigation is focused on whether the social network violated a 2011 consent decree in which it promised to protect user data and inform users of changes in how their data was used  The inquiry started last March under Mr  Simons s Republican predecessor  Maureen Ohlhausen  after a report in The New York Times revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had analyzed the data of 87 million users without their permission The agency is considering imposing a multibillion dollar fine on Facebook as well as new requirements to strengthen protections on how data is collected and shared  according to two people close to talks between the agency and the company  The two sides have discussed a possible settlement for weeks  said the people  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing Facebook declined to comment about Mr  Simons and the investigation  The social network has defended its actions  saying that when it learned a researcher violated its terms of service by giving user data to Cambridge Analytica  it demanded that the data be destroyed and was promised that it had been On Wednesday  the company announced plans to shift to a more privacy focused platform  Mark Zuckerberg  the company s chief executive  said Facebook would invest in encrypted communications and refashion its messaging tools to emphasize private conversations ImageMr  Simons and his agency s four other commissioners are investigating whether Facebook violated its promises to protect personal data CreditT J  Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesMr  Simons declined to discuss the Facebook case  And he was even guarded about his own use of technology  He would not say whether he used Facebook or two other popular apps owned by the company  Instagram and WhatsApp  He doesn t use other social media like Twitter  he said  aides write the tweets from his official F T C  account  I don t even know how to access my account   Mr  Simons said His comfort zone is antitrust regulation  a major focus for the F T C  and an area in which he has worked for most of his career  In his meticulous office  Mr  Simons keeps handy a worn Yale Law Journal with red plastic tabs on antitrust articles  He has had six of its authors speak at the F T C  since he arrived In one of his first actions as chairman  he held hearings on updating merger reviews and antitrust enforcement in the digital age  In late February  he announced a task force of 17 antitrust staff members to study potential problems that could arise from past tech mergers  In antitrust  you want to focus on areas where there is likely to be market power or monopoly power   Mr  Simons said   So it is not unreasonable to look at big digital platforms and say  well  that might be an ripe area to look at  He is new to the world of data privacy and admits he is cramming to understand it  immersing himself in articles and grilling staff about data protection  But that  he said  allows him to bring a  fresh perspective  to privacy enforcement  I am willing to look at everything with a fresh eye  and to question long held beliefs and assumptions   he said The F T C  monitors whether companies like Google  Uber and Facebook break promises written into privacy policies  But it can t directly fine a company for a first time offense  it can only charge a company with deceptive or unfair business practices  which the agency must prove in court  The potential penalty against Facebook could reach billions of dollars because the case hinges on whether it violated a previous settlement Mr  Simons argues that the agency needs more direct authority to oversee privacy practices and fine companies  He says it is too hard to prove to a court that someone has been harmed by a company s unauthorized use of their data  It s important that we get civil penalty authority   he said   For companies that have lots of money  the impact would be sufficient to deter them  Privacy groups say the agency has missed numerous opportunities to punish companies with its existing powers  Many compare the commission with European regulators  which have levied hefty fines on Google  Facebook  Amazon and Apple for violating antitrust  privacy  tax and security laws Some privacy advocates are also concerned about Mr  Simon s inexperience in the area  saying it requires a deep understanding of complicated technologies  I don t think he understands the dimensions and implications underlying the consumer privacy threat   said Jeffrey Chester  executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  a nonprofit consumer advocacy group Mr  Simons said there were obvious differences between how the United States and Europe viewed privacy  The E U  has this strong sense of the right to be forgotten   he said   We don t have that  We have the opposite of that  We have the First Amendment  And he said the details of how the government handled digital privacy should be for lawmakers  not him  to sort out  Privacy involves very important societal and cultural values that really need to be determined by the Congress   Mr  Simons said  pointing toward Capitol Hill  less than a mile up Pennsylvania Avenue from his office  Not   he said   by unelected F T C  commissioners  
AMSTERDAM   In a radiation proof room at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam  Emar Thomasa sits behind shielded glass as he carefully measures and mixes lutetium octreotate  an intravenous treatment for certain types of cancer The Dutch hospital has been offering it to patients for more than a decade at 16 000 euros   18 000  for one course of treatments  Drug firm Novartis  which in 2018 acquired rights to sell it in Europe  is asking more than five times that for its proprietary version  Lutathera Thomasa is part of a protest against high drug prices launched by an unlikely group of rebels  Dutch pharmacies Three   Erasmus  Amsterdam s University Medical Center  UMC  and the Transvaal Pharmacy in The Hague   have vowed to bypass drug company products and make treatments for a handful of rare diseases themselves  exercising their right to  compound  medicines The Dutch market is small  with only hundreds of patients for the diseases in question  But the dispute is part of a growing global backlash against high drug prices  from the United States and Canada to Japan  and campaigners said it was being closely watched by health experts elsewhere  People with rare diseases are dependent on medicines that are so expensive that they can t afford them  when they could be offered for a much lower price   said UMC pharmacist Marleen Kemper  The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in developing good products  but we think it s not fair if these firms make big money off these patients  Compounding is the ancient practice of preparing medicines for individual patients  Pharmacists are trained to compound  though nowadays most medicines are made by industrial producers  Drug companies have raised concerns about the safety of compounded medicines that have not been approved by European regulators  But the specialized compounding pharmacies  which have on site laboratories  have been backed by the Dutch government as part of efforts to tame rapidly rising medicine costs  UMC received a 5 million euro grant last month to expand its compounding program  It plans to use the money to set up a center to swap know how with pharmacies at home and abroad The drug industry  including Swiss giant Novartis and Italian based Leadiant  argue Dutch national supervision of pharmacy preparations is not comparable to the European standards that apply to pharmaceutical companies  A spokesman for Leadiant said when Dutch patients suffering from rare diseases were exposed to medicines that had not been subject to the stringent testing required of authorized drugs  it could have  significant repercussions  for their health Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan told Reuters the price his company asks for Lutathera is justified  He said it was impossible to compare the treatment made at Erasmus with Lutathera  which received approval from EU watchdogs after proving it worked in its exact formulation The potential perils of compounding were shown in 2012 in the United States  where the market is more developed  A meningitis outbreak that killed more than 60 people was traced to contamination in steroid injections made at the New England Compounding Center  which was then overseen by Massachusetts state regulators  GLOBAL BACKLASH The worldwide push against high drug prices has seen the Trump administration in the United States declare bringing down prescription prices a top priority  In Canada  industry lobbying groups have offered concessions as they seek to avert a government crackdown  And in Japan  regulators are considering a cost effectiveness test as a means of capping prices The Dutch pharmacies  whose production is on a small scale  acknowledge they may face legal challenges from the drug industry  However  such a case could set a precedent for other European countries  The Netherlands has an influential voice in Europe as the seat of the European Medicines Agency  which scrutinizes and approves drugs for all EU countries  The EMA has moved to Amsterdam as a result of the Brexit vote Pharmacies retain the right under European and American law to prepare medicines for individual patients  Common examples including making lower dosage versions for children or liquid versions for people with difficulty swallowing However  in the United States  for profit compounding pharmacies have tested the limits of what they are allowed to do in recent years  including mixing medicines in large quantities  In some cases  that has prompted legal conflicts with drugmakers Official scrutiny of the practice increased after the 2012 deaths in Massachusetts  which led to U S  lawmakers requiring bulk compounding facilities to register with the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and meet quality and labeling standards   still not as stringent as full FDA drug approval Els Torreele  who oversees the Doctors Without Borders Access Campaign  applauded the Dutch pharmacies  move  She said the developments in the Netherlands were being followed by medical experts and politicians in other countries  which could follow a similar path Torreele said big pharmaceutical companies sometimes lost sight of the fact that rules granting them exclusive manufacturing rights for new drugs were intended to foster innovation  not guarantee large profits  If  drug companies  can play a role in providing medicines at an affordable price  fine  but when they become a barrier  then there s a problem   she said Dutch Medical Care Minister Bruno Bruins attended the opening of a new compounding laboratory at the Transvaal pharmacy in January  His government has vowed to curb drug price increases  a pledge welcomed by the public Costs for new medicines in the Netherlands rose 9 percent in 2018  according to a report by the country s Heath Authority  continuing a multi year trend  We need drugmakers like Novartis for medicines now and the medicines to come   Bruins said   We really can t do without them  And yet we want them for a reasonable price  NOVARTIS CEO TROUBLEDThe first two drugs targeted by Dutch pharmacies are Novartis s Lutathera and a drug called CDCA  registered in Europe by Leadiant  High prices are not unusual for new rare disease drugs  as companies must recoup development costs from a relatively small group of patients Novartis charges 92 000 euros for a one off course of four Lutathera injections  But while the drug is innovative  its development costs were relatively small and cannot justify the price tag  said Erasmus MC Chief Executive Ernst Kuipers Main development costs amounted to about 40 million euros  including 15 million euros in public funding  according to Erasmus   where most of the testing took place   and a review published in the Dutch Journal of Medicine  Novartis bought the rights to Lutathera with a  3 9 billion euro takeover of French company AAA last year  The drug had just been approved by the EMA as a treatment for certain cases of endocrine cancers  which affect one in 27 000 people  Although Lutathera is not a cure  it often gives patients several extra years of healthy life  Novartis boss Narasimhan said he was worried by developments in the Netherlands  The Netherlands  characterization that the local medicine that is made in the hospitals is the same as what we ve done from a regulatory  full development standpoint  particularly given  the Dutch  will house the European Medicines Agency  I think is troubling   he told Reuters in an interview  GENETIC DISEASEIn the case of CDCA  a decades old gallstone medicine  the drug used to cost 30 000 40 000 euros for a year s worth of pills  Since the 1990s it has been used only as an off label treatment for a rare genetic disease known as CTX  That changed when Leadiant formally registered the drug as a treatment for CTX with the EMA in 2017  and began asking 163 000 euros  Amsterdam s UMC  which treats all 60 known CTX patients in the Netherlands  compounded CDCA itself from April August 2018  Then the Dutch Health Inspectorate found an impurity in its formulation after Leadiant requested a lab inspection The inspectorate  rightly protected patient safety   Leadiant told Reuters  UMC says it intends to resume production of CDCA once it can guarantee it meets all required standards There are only 200 people in Europe known to have CTX  and only several hundred cases have been recorded worldwide  But scientists say it goes undiagnosed in most cases  and the true number of sufferers in the United States alone could be 10 000 With early and lifelong treatment with CDCA  the effects of CTX  which include mental deficiencies and eventually death  are preventable  Leadiant defends its pricing  saying it bore significant costs by undertaking a human study demonstrating the drug s effectiveness  which had never been done before Battle lines are drawn  Bruins told parliament last month that he planned to  confront  drugmakers and demand transparency on development costs  I can and will be having talks with a lot of individual companies   he said   And I ll say  of course I want to keep your innovative power  but temper your prices    Reporting by Toby Sterling  John Miller and Elyse Tanouye  Editing by Pravin Char 
When the Education Department approved a proposal by Dream Center  a Christian nonprofit with no experience in higher education  to buy a troubled chain of for profit colleges  skeptics warned that the charity was unlikely to pull off the turnaround it promised What they didn t foresee was just how quickly and catastrophically it would fail Barely a year after the takeover  dozens of Dream Center campuses are nearly out of money and may close as soon as Friday  More than a dozen others have been sold in the hope they can survive The affected schools   Argosy University  South University and the Art Institutes   have about 26 000 students in programs spanning associate degrees in dental hygiene and doctoral programs in law and psychology  Fourteen campuses  mostly Art Institute locations  have a new owner after a hastily arranged transfer involving private equity executives  More than 40 others are under the control of a court appointed receiver who has accused school officials of trying to keep the doors open by taking millions of dollars earmarked for students The problems  arising amid the Trump administration s broad efforts to deregulate the for profit college industry  began almost immediately after Dream Center acquired the schools in 2017  The charity  started 25 years ago and affiliated with a Pentecostal megachurch in Los Angeles  has a nationwide network of outreach programs for problems like homelessness and domestic violence and said it planned to use the schools to fund its expansion Now its students   many with credits that cannot be easily transferred   are stuck in a meltdown  On Wednesday  members of the faculty at Argosy s Chicago and Northern Virginia campuses told students that they had been fired and instructed to remove their belongings  In Phoenix  an unpaid landlord locked students out of their classrooms  In California  a dean advised students two months away from graduation not to invite family to attend from out of town  In less than a month  everything I have worked for the past three years has been taken from me   said Jayne Kenney  who is pursuing her doctorate in clinical psychology at Argosy s Chicago campus   I am also conscious of the fact that what seems like the swift fall of an ax in less than one month has in reality been festering for years  The fall accelerated last week when the Education Department cut off federal student loan funds to Argosy after the court appointed receiver said school officials had taken about  13 million owed to students at 22 campuses and used it for expenses like payroll  The students  who had borrowed extra money to cover things like rent and groceries  were forced to use food banks or skip classes for lack of bus fare Lauren Jackson  a single mother seeking a doctorate at the Illinois School of Professional Psychology  an Argosy school in Chicago  did not receive the roughly  10 000 she was due in January  She has been paying expenses for herself and her 6 year old daughter with borrowed money and GoFundMe donations On Tuesday  after three months of not paying her rent  she received an eviction notice  I didn t want to go home and tell my baby that Mommy may not be a doctor   said Ms  Jackson  whose school could close Friday   Now I don t want to go home and tell her that we don t have a home   Bad for Everyone Led by Secretary Betsy DeVos  the Education Department has reversed an Obama era crackdown on troubled vocational and career schools and allowed new and less experienced entrants into the field Image What seems like the swift fall of an ax in less than one month has in reality been festering for years   said Jayne Kenney  a doctoral student at Argosy in Chicago CreditTaylor Glascock for The New York Times The industry was on its heels  but they ve been given new life by the department under DeVos   said Eileen Connor  the director of litigation at Harvard Law School s Project on Predatory Student Lending Ms  DeVos  who invested in companies with ties to for profit colleges before taking office  has made it an agency priority to unfetter for profit schools by eliminating restrictions on them  She also allowed several for profit schools to evade even those loosened rules by converting to nonprofits That s what Dream Center wanted to do when it asked to buy the remains of Education Management Corporation Education Management  once the nation s second largest for profit college operator  was struggling for survival after an investigation into its recruiting tactics resulted in a  200 million settlement in 2015  Despite those troubles  it had 65 000 students  and some of its schools maintained strong reputations Dream Center is connected to Angelus Temple  which was founded by Aimee Semple McPherson  a charismatic evangelist once portrayed by Faye Dunaway in a TV movie   The Disappearance of Aimee   It is affiliated with the Foursquare Church  an evangelical denomination with outposts in 146 countries Buying a chain of schools  aligns perfectly with our mission  which views education as a primary means of life transformation   Randall Barton  the foundation s managing director  said when Dream Center announced its plan But Dream Center had never run colleges  It hired a team including Brent Richardson  who worked on the conversion of Grand Canyon University to a nonprofit as its chairman  to lead the schools  corporate parent  Dream Center Education Holdings  He stepped down in January Alarms were ringing from the moment the takeover was proposed  Dream Center s effort to buy the failing ITT Technical Institutes schools had fallen apart after resistance from the Obama administration  When it asked to buy Education Management s schools  consumer groups  members of Congress and some regional accreditors raised concerns But in late 2017  Ms  DeVos s agency gave preliminary approval to Dream Center s plan Almost immediately  the organization discovered the schools were in worse shape than expected  with aging facilities and outdated technology  The universities  were  on the whole  failing without hope for redemption   the receiver wrote in a court filing last month Dream Center had anticipated a  30 million profit in its first year  Mr  Barton wrote in a recent legal filing  Instead  it was facing a  38 million loss And Dream Center showed little inclination to curb the tactics that got Education Management in trouble  like misleading students about their employment prospects  The executives it installed cultivated a high pressure culture in which profit surpassed all other concerns  according to a report filed last year by Thomas J  Perrelli  the court appointed monitor overseeing the schools  compliance with their state settlements ImageArgosy

Glascock for The New York TimesBy the end of 2018  Dream Center was facing eviction on at least nine campuses and owed creditors more than  40 million  and Education Department officials scrambled to plan for what looked like an imminent implosion  We know all too well that precipitous school closures are bad for everyone involved and leave too many students high and dry   said Liz Hill  an agency spokeswoman   Teams of people at the department have been working tirelessly on behalf of students   caught up in this situation through no fault of their own   with the singular goal in mind to ensure as many students as possible had options to complete their education  A Rapid UnravelingThe problems grew in mid January when a creditor sued Dream Center Education Holdings over unpaid bills and asked a federal court to install a receiver to wind down the insolvent organization  Within a day  a federal judge appointed Mark Dottore  who was working with Dream Center as a paid consultant  as its receiver At a forum last month with students at Argosy University in Chicago  Mr  Dottore tried to calm an anxious crowd  We will make it until June  I can pretty much assure you of that   Mr  Dottore said  according to a recording provided to The New York Times by a student   By hook or by crook  I m going to get us there  But on Wednesday  Mr  Dottore filed an emergency motion describing his plans to sell Argosy s campuses  plus the South University and Art Institute campuses that haven t been sold already  Any that didn t have a buyer by Friday would close  he said Even as Argosy campuses prepared to close  a dean at the American School of Professional Psychology in Northern Virginia emailed students on Wednesday  imploring them to attend classes the rest of the week  if we are to save the semester  Scott Peck  a 50 year old student there  left behind a six figure salary in software and cashed out his 401 k  savings to pay for his doctorate  But he feels worse for his younger classmates  What s so heartbreaking is to see what s happening to these kids in their 20s  who are believing things they re told by people that they trust   he said Argosy was supposed to pay students the extra money they had borrowed  then seek reimbursement from the government  But Argosy reported that the money was paid out even though it wasn t  Mr  Dottore wrote in court filings  and used the reimbursements for operating expenses instead A Dream Center spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment on the fraud accusation While Argosy students have little hope of getting back money they paid out of pocket  the Education Department said the federal loan debt of affected students would be forgiven for this semester  If the schools close  students can seek help under a program covering school shutdowns ImageScott Peck  50  left behind a six figure salary in software sales and consulting and cashed out his 401 k  savings to pay for his doctorate in clinical

shunted to a new owner in a deal partly orchestrated by the Education Department But the arrangement with Studio Enterprise  a Los Angeles company that provides support services for creative industry training programs  raises its own questions  Studio is personally funded by the principals of Colbeck Capital Management  a New York private equity firm that set up the nonprofit owner Dream Center said in July that it would close more than 30 ailing campuses across all three chains  but a few months later it reached a deal with Studio to salvage some Art Institute locations As Dream Center s
